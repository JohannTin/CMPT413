"Right food can help beat depression, say nutritionists",https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/health/right-food-can-help-beat-depression-say-nutritionists-329914,,,,"Hyderabad, October 26 Eating the right food can help beat depression effectively during difficult times, say nutritionists. Troubles linked to personal health, family situation, financial condition, and any other issue which might trigger despair during Covid-19 pandemic is likely to result in causing mental depression among those facing these situations. The common belief is that people when depressed tend to consume food in excess. However, nutritionists say eating the right food will also help people overcome depression. A Lancet report recently indicated that more and more people are suffering from depression related problems due to the after-effects of Covid-19 pandemic. Commenting on linkage between food and depression, Dr N. Malleshwari, Chief Dietician amp; Nutritionist, Gleneagles Global Hospital said: ""Poor food choices and selection of foods might contribute to deficiency of the nutrients which actually can result in depression. Some amino acids like tryptophan, tyrosine, methionine, and phenylalanine are often helpful in treating many mild disorders including depression."" Mental depression is a serious problem that affects people around the world, and in many, this could be a life changing occurrence. ""While those who accept they are depressed, seek medical attention or counselling to overcome the condition, the best means to beat depression is to bring about lifestyle changes and start consuming a healthy diet. While medicines or counselling provide temporary relief, eating right food and bringing in positive lifestyle changes will help conquer the problem forever. Omega 3 fatty acids (EPA amp; DHA) elicit anti-depressant effects among humans and are very important to be included in diet,"" said Malleshwari. ""Human bodies normally produce molecules which are called free radicals which could lead to cell damage resulting in quick ageing and cause other problems. Consuming antioxidants-rich foods and vitamins-rich fruits and vegetables will have a positive impact on the brain and certainly lessen the destructive effects of free radicals. Foods like carrots, pumpkin, spinach, oranges, tomato, nuts and seeds, will be of great help,"" said Dr Arun Kumar, Chief Dietitian, SLG Hospitals. Swetha, HoD - Nutrition, Aware Gleneagles Global Hospital believes that eating small portions of proteins several times in a day will help boost energy in the human body and will clear the mind. ""Protein-rich tuna fish, turkey, chicken have amino acids which help the human body stay alert. Beans, peas, milk, soya, yogurt too are a good source of healthy proteins. People who are suffering from depression must ensure they do not consume alcohol, or smoke, and even cut down on caffeine intake to overcome the problem."" Overweight or obese people are more likely to suffer from depression because excess body weight will impact immune system and bring hormonal changes among both men and women. Obese individuals must immediately work on cutting down weight if they intend to overcome depression, and healthy food habits are a first step in that direction. Many people who are depressed also have problems with alcohol or drugs; and these not only can interfere with mood, sleep, and motivation, they can also reduce the effectiveness of depression medications.

The post These Scalp Massagers Claim to Promote Hair Growth, so Sign Me and My Tresses up appeared first on Lifehacker Australia.","In the last year alone, you’ve probably noticed the haircare industry bringing out more treatments targeting your scalp health — exfoliating scalp scrubs, micellar shampoos, detox sprays, and now, scalp massager brushes. Scalp massagers do exactly what it sounds like — they’re a handheld, brush-like device that you can use to stimulate and exfoliate the scalp. You’ve probably noticed them starting to pop up online, which of course has piqued your interest and you’ve ended up here. But is using one actually better for your scalp health than a massage with your fingers? Short answer: yep, it can be! Healthy hair starts with your scalp, so if your scalp is littered with dead skin cells and product buildup, it makes it much harder for your hair to grow properly. Regularly using a scalp brush when you shampoo your hair helps to remove all the dead skin cells and product that’s accumulated between washes. The massaging motion alone is also said to help stimulate growth, as it promotes blood circulation in the hair follicle and can help to deliver more nutrients. So you really don’t have anything to lose by incorporating one into your routine. Plus, they feel so damn good! That said, if you’re someone who suffers from scalp irritation, dandruff or psoriasis, you might want to skip the scalp massage. Rubbing or scrubbing the scalp when it’s in that condition can further cause irritation, inflammation and swelling. Scalp brushes act more as a preventative in this instance than a treatment. Ahead, we’ve rounded up a range of affordable scalp massagers you can buy online and have delivered to your door. READ MORE What Are Scalp Scrubs and How Do You Use Them?

Kennedy, Jr., Chairman of Children’s Health Defense (CHD), and Meryl Nass, MD have sent a letter to each member of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) highlighting the latest peer reviewed research that shows children have virtually zero risk of hospitalization and death from the COVID-19 virus. “Conversely, according to Pfizer’s own study trial data , the chance of death in children from the Pfizer vaccine is 107 times higher than death due to COVID,” said Dr. Brian Hooker, CHD Chief Science Officer. VRBPAC meets tomorrow, October 26, to decide whether or not to approve Pfizer’s experimental COVID vaccine for children ages five to eleven. Here are the VRBPAC committee members: Hana El Sahly, MD ; Paula Annunziato, MD ; Archana Chatterjee, MD; CAPT Amanda Cohn, MD ; Hayley Gans, MD ; Holly Janes, PhD ; Michael Kurilla, MD ; Myron Levine, MD ; H. Cody Meissner, MD ; Paul Offit; Steven Pergam, M D; Andrea Shane, MD ; Paul Spearman, MD ; Geeta K. Swamy, MD ; Gregg Sylvester, MD ; A. Oveta Fuller, PhD ; James Hildreth, Sr., Ph., MD ; Jeannette Lee, PhD ; Ofer Levy, MD ; Patrick Moore, MD ; Michael Nelson, M.D ; Stanley Perlman, MD ; Jay Portnoy, MD ; and Eric Rubin, MD . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is scheduled to meet November 2 and 3 to consider and vote upon the same experimental vaccine. If both committees approve the vaccine for this age group, the decision is then reviewed by CDC Director Rochelle Walensky to formalize the recommendation. “Parents should be aware that if these committees give Big Pharma an early holiday present, the vaccines will still only have emergency use authorization (EUA),” said CHD president and general counsel Mary Holland. “This means the shots are experimental and legally cannot be mandated under U.S. law. Parents can say no.” School administrators can also decline to incorporate any requirements regarding COVID vaccine status for attending school. “These administrators should not be in the uncomfortable position of being the vaccine police for the pharmaceutical industry,” commented Holland. “The choice for parents and school officials is simple. They should never allow the government to force a medical procedure on children especially when they have a minuscule risk of hospitalization and death from COVID.” Children have very low transmission rates of the virus as well. Additionally, the vaccine’s experimental mRNA technology has no long-term safety studies upon which parents can make informed decisions after weighing risks and benefits. And, if adult vaccines are any indication, the vaccine will start to wane in children in two to three months according to two recent studies . From mid-December, 2020 through October 15, 2021, the U.S. government’s database, the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) received 818,044 reports of injury following COVID vaccination including 17,128 deaths . ""These numbers are astounding,” said CHD Executive Director Laura Bono. “Half of all reports and two thirds of all deaths reported to the VAERS system in the U.S. since the tracking system was developed in 1990 relate to the COVID 19 vaccines. No physician with an ounce of integrity could possibly vote to approve such a risky vaccine to people of any age, let alone healthy five-year-olds who are at virtually zero risk for complications from COVID."" On October 20, well in advance of the FDA and CDC meetings, the Biden administration said it had procured enough vaccine to vaccinate all 28 million 5- to 11-year-olds in the U.S. To CHD’s knowledge, the Biden Administration has not released the dollar amount of taxpayer funds that was transferred to Pfizer for children’s shots but, even at the highly unlikely low cost of $1 a dose, it translates into $65 million dollars handed to Big Pharma before the vaccine was even FDA authorized and CDC recommended. “It’s no surprise that the federal government and Pharma already know how these votes will go,” said Holland. “These meetings are nothing more than empty rituals in support of lining Pharma’s pockets. Parents need to know that the fix is in and an approval from either of these committees means nothing in terms of the safety of the vaccines Pharma wants injected into their children.” The letter from Kennedy and CHD said that committee members “should not participate in an exercise disguising a foregone conclusion” and that “should you grant EUA status to this pediatric EUA vaccine, CHD is poised to take legal action against you and other VRBPAC voting members as well as the FDA. CHD will seek to hold you accountable for recklessly endangering this population with a product that has little efficacy but which may put them, without warning, at risk of many adverse health consequences...” According to recent data from Indiana University’s Observatory on Social Media, CHD’s website is shared on Twitter more often than those of the World Health Organization and CDC combined. This indicates that a growing number of Americans and citizens of the world are saying no to their government imposing health mandates, recommendations and other personal choices on them and their children that is clearly in violation of their individual rights. The same data also showed that CHD’s content, which recently reached nearly 10 million page views per month, is more widely shared than that from Reuters , The Daily Mail , The Washington Post , Newsweek and CNN. Dr. Meryl Nass will be conducting a live blog during the proceedings of both the VRBAC and ACIP meetings to interpret and comment on the presentations and votes from CHD-TV . Viewers can also submit questions to Dr. Nass in real time. To watch and participate in Dr. Nass’s live blog of both committee meetings, visit CHD.T V. Concerned members of the public can add a comment to the FDA VRBPAC Committee by Monday at midnight. ### Children's Health Defense is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. Its mission is to end childhood health epidemics by working aggressively to eliminate harmful exposures, hold those responsible accountable, and establish safeguards to prevent future harm.

He was 59. Tyler's manager said he died peacefully at home in Los Angeles Sunday morning. ""If you met him once you made a friend for life,"" his manager said. He is survived by his wife Jennifer Carno, whom he married in 2017. Tyler was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer in September 2018, he revealed this summer. He said doctors discovered it during a routine physical when he was 56. Tyler was best known for the role of Gunther, the Central Perk barista who had an unrequited crush on Jennifer Aniston's Rachel Greene. Warner Bros.

""Sabrina, the Teenage Witch,"" and ""Scrubs,"" and he even played himself once on ""Episodes"" with Matt LeBlanc. Most recently, he released a spoken-word performance of the poem ""If You Knew,"" which was adapted into a short video to raise awareness for the Prostate Cancer Foundation. Donations to the Prostate Cancer Foundation in Tyler's name may be made here. Last month, Tyler made an appearance via Zoom on the ""Friends: The Reunion"" special. The special, which aired on HBO Max, saw the main cast -- Courteney Cox, David Schwimmer, Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, and Matthew Perry -- revisit some of the biggest on-screen moments and discuss their memories of the show. Asked whether the ""Friends"" cast already knew about his illness, Tyler said the show's producers had been aware ""for a long time"" and that Schwimmer had corresponded with him on Instagram. According to the Mayo Clinic, prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer and the second-biggest cause of cancer death for men in the United States. While some types of prostate cancer grow slowly and may need minimal or even no treatment, others are aggressive and can spread quickly.

BREASTFEEDING AND CORONAVIRUS: MOTHERS WITH COVID-19 UNLIKELY TO PASS VIRUS IF THEY USE PROPER HYGIENE ""While many studies have found that breastfeeding improves a child’s long-term health and well-being, our study is one of very few that has looked at the long-term health effects for women who had breastfed their babies,"" Molly Fox, the study’s author, said in a news release . ""Our findings, which show superior cognitive performance among women over 50 who had breastfed, suggest that breastfeeding may be ‘neuroprotective’ later in life,"" she added. The study , titled, ""Women who breastfeed exhibit cognitive benefits after age 50,"" asserts that breastfeeding’s biological effects and psychosocial effects, such as improved stress regulation, could exert long-term benefits for the mother’s brain. ""Because breastfeeding has also been found to help regulate stress, promote infant bonding and lower the risk of post-partum depression, which suggest acute neurocognitive benefits for the mother, we suspected that it could also be associated with long-term superior cognitive performance for the mother as well,"" Fox said. Participants in the study, all women over 50 years old, completed a comprehensive battery of psychological tests measuring learning, delayed recall, executive functioning and processing speed. Results revealed that those who had breastfed at one point in their lives performed better in all four categories compared to women who had not.

4 Ways to Trim Your Nose Hairs Safely at Home,https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2021/10/best-nose-hair-removal-products/,"['Health', 'Life', 'affiliate', 'amazon-partnership', 'nose hair', 'nose hair removal']",['Lifehacker Staff '],,"Nose hair is one of those pesky things we all have, but some have a lot more than others. If... The post 4 Ways to Trim Your Nose Hairs Safely at Home appeared first on Lifehacker Australia.","Nose hair is one of those pesky things we all have, but some have a lot more than others. If you’ve ever had a good look up there in the bathroom mirror, you might be shocked at the amount of hair you have. Before you start hacking at it though, it’s important to know how to remove it safely. We’re here to share the four best nose hair removal methods you can do at home. READ MORE How to Clean Your Ears Safely at Home Without Cotton Tips Why do we have nose hair? Before you start the removal process, it’s important to know that your nose hair (while pesky) actually serves an important purpose for your health. It’s actually the first line of defence against bacteria and germs in the nasal cavity, so you don’t want to get rid of it all. More than that, it’s also part of the system that protects your lungs from dirt and debris that gets into the airways. If you didn’t have nose hair you’d be entirely vulnerable to all these things which opens you up to infections. So, if you do choose to manage the amount of nose hair for aesthetic purposes, it needs to be done properly and hygienically. How to get rid of nose hair at home Now that we’ve established the importance of nose hairs, we can chat about the safest methods of managing it at home. These are trimming, waxing, plucking and cutting (with specialised scissors). Manically pulling out the hair with tweezers is highly discouraged for a bunch of different reasons. First of all, it’s painful as hell but it’s also one of the less hygienic methods of removing hair. So put down the tweezers and try one of these four methods first. Best nose hair removal tools Now that we’ve told you explicitly what not to do, it’s time to focus on the tools that are actually safe to use at home. The good news is, you don’t have to be a professional and they’re really simple to operate and clean. Trimmers Philips Multigroom Series 7000 12-in-1, $109 This device is a best-seller for a reason – its versatility and affordability. Coming with 12 different heads, not only can you trim your nose hairs, but you can also shave your face, eyebrows, ears and anything else that needs some tidying up. Buy the Philips Multigroom Series 7000 12-in-1 ($109) from Amazon here. Panasonic ER430K Ear & Nose Trimmer, $35.08 The dual-edge blades on this trimmer make it easy to trim nose, ear and facial hair with precision. It’s fu waterproof so you can use it in the shower if you wish, and it has an advanced micro vacuum system to suck up trimmed hair particles into a chamber. Buy the Panasonic ER430K Ear & Nose Trimmer ($35.08) from Amazon here. Philips Series 3000 Ear, Eyebrow & Nose Trimmer, on sale for $24.95 (usually $29.95) The shape of this trimmer is specifically made to reach into your nose and earholes, making it a super easy trimmer option. It also has safeguards so you won’t hurt yourself if you make contact. Buy the Philips Series 3000 Ear, Eyebrow & Nose Trimmer ($24.95) from Amazon here. Plucking THE PLUCK Nose Hair Remover, $37.66 This looks like a torture device but it’s actually designed to be relatively pain-free. The beauty of this device is that it removes your nose hair at the root which diminishes its ability to grow back over time – so less plucking for you in the long run. Just pop the tip of the device into your nostril and pull down on the blue toggle to jerk the hairs out, then go forth and enjoy your hair-free nose. Buy THE PLUCK Nose Hair Remover ($37.66) from Amazon here. Scissors Nose Hair Trimming Scissors, $37.87 It might sound borderline insane to trim your nose hairs with scissors but it can actually be done (with the right tool). These scissors are a popular nose hair removal method as it’s not painful at all but still gives a very precise trim. Buy the Nose Hair Trimming Scissors ($37.87) from Amazon here. Waxing Nose Wax Kit, $19.99 This product isn’t for the faint-hearted, so if you’re looking for something relatively painless you might want to pass on this one. Essentially, you heat up the wax in the microwave before dipping the sticks in and inserting them into your nostrils. Give it around 90 seconds and then pull down as quickly as possible to rip the hairs right out. You’ll get the satisfaction of seeing all the hair once it’s removed but you may not be able to see it through the tears in your eyes. Buy the Nose Wax Kit ($19.99) from Amazon here. Nad’s Nose Wax Kit, $8.75 Same same, but a little cheaper and it’s formulated with chamomile and aloe extract to help your sensitive nose area as much as possible, considering you’re tipping all the hair out.

That site, EnableAir.com, appears to be connected to another B.C. doctor.",,2021-10-25 12:00:00,"A B.C. physician accused of spreading misinformation about COVID-19 is now under investigation for allegedly writing phoney mask and vaccine exemptions offered through a Kelowna-based website. CBC News has obtained a four-page ""declaration certificate of medical exemption including psychosocial conditions"" that was purportedly signed by Dr. Stephen Malthouse and produced through a service called EnableAir.com. That website appears to be connected to another B.C. doctor, Dr. Gwyllyn Goddard, whose medical licence is temporarily inactive. A copy of the same certificate has been sent to the College of Physicians and Surgeons of B.C. and they are investigating, CBC has confirmed. A spokesperson for B.C.'s Health Ministry did not answer direct questions about EnableAir.com, but confirmed there is no such thing as an exemption certificate for either masks or vaccines. EnableAir.com promises ""authentic medical exemptions,"" including QR codes, for people who are ""concerned with totalitarian mainstream narratives,"" and advertises the services of five unnamed Canadian physicians. It's not clear how much the service costs, but the website warns prospective customers to "" mentally prepare for the invoice ."" Audio Divorced Sask. parents fight in court over COVID-19 vaccination for teen daughter The certificate allegedly signed by Malthouse includes a two-page preamble invoking the Canadian Human Rights Act, the Constitution, the UN's Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights and the Nuremberg Code. It doesn't offer any specifics about why the bearer should be exempted from mask and vaccine mandates, but offers a long list of possible reasons, including vaccine allergies but also HIV, autism, ""impaired social development,"" asthma, eczema, migraines and ""personal belief."" Doctor already faces discipline related to COVID-19 The contact information displayed on the certificate obtained by CBC matches publicly listed contact information for Goddard. The Kelowna post office box is connected to his cannabis consulting firm , CanaBC Services Ltd., and the fax number is listed on his personal website . Goddard did not respond to emailed questions or text messages, and hung up on a reporter when contacted by phone. The full contents of EnableAir.com were taken offline within hours of that phone call. B.C. doctor disciplined for 'harmful' COVID-19 misinformation claims free speech violations Neither Malthouse nor his lawyer, Rocco Galati of Toronto, responded to questions about the certificate. EnableAir.com advertises that 50 per cent of ""post-administrative fees"" will be donated to Galati and the Constitutional Rights Centre, an organization he founded. However, Galati told CBC he has no connection to the website. Dr. Stephen Malthouse appeared at a rally against COVID-19 restrictions in Duncan, B.C., last November, referring to the disease as a 'so-called pandemic.' (YouTube) Malthouse, a family doctor on Denman Island, is already the subject of disciplinary proceedings at the college as well as complaints from at least 10 other physicians. Over the last year, he's appeared at several rallies against pandemic-related measures, falsely claiming that COVID-19 is no more deadly than the flu and that vaccines are more dangerous. His musings have gone viral online. According to a petition Malthouse filed in B.C. Supreme Court in June, he faces a reprimand from the college, which wants to bar him from speaking on issues related to COVID-19. Malthouse has asked the court to block those measures, arguing they're an infringement on his right to free speech. Doctors 'need to provide objective medical evidence' College registrar Dr. Heidi Oetter said she couldn't comment on any investigations into Malthouse or EnableAir.com, but the college has a standard for what's expected of any doctor writing exemptions. ""It's very clear about the need to provide objective medical evidence. You can't simply restate something just because the patient wants you to do that,"" she said. ""If somebody is signing a letter that is inconsistent with those expectations, they may face an investigation by the college and, if warranted, regulatory action."" The college posted a notice last week in response to reports of fraudulent exemption letters circulating in the province. It includes guidance for businesses or employers about how to identify a valid exemption. In B.C., proof of vaccination is required to access many non-essential services, and there are very few valid exemptions. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press) There's a very short list of acceptable reasons for an exemption or deferral from a COVID-19 vaccine, including a history of anaphylactic reactions to both mRNA vaccines like Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, and adenovirus vector vaccines like AstraZeneca. Ontario's College of Physicians and Surgeons has barred three doctors from issuing mask and vaccine exemptions in recent weeks. A spokesperson for that college said he couldn't comment on any possible connection to EnableAir.com. B.C. doctors urge action on colleague spreading COVID-19 misinformation Ontario doctor accused of spreading COVID-19 misinformation barred from providing vaccine, mask exemptions But one of those physicians, Dr. Patrick Phillips , has promoted EnableAir.com on social media . Another has a B.C. connection — Dr. Rochagne Kilian previously worked in Williams Lake, and held a medical licence in this province from 2009 to 2014. Oetter said while the rules are slightly different in B.C., similar restrictions could be placed on doctors here if evidence suggested they were providing fraudulent exemptions.

""Health systems and health care professionals have demonstrated a remarkable ability to rapidly adapt or modify care practices to deliver optimal cancer care, while minimizing risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and optimizing health system resources,"" said Professor Dorothy Keefe, CEO of Cancer Australia. ""A range of strategies has been identified to enhance and embed these high value changes in cancer care during the pandemic and in a post-pandemic environment."" ""These strategies allow flexibility for jurisdictions, organizations and individuals to address these priorities in ways that suit their local context and workforce capacity."" ""Regular and ongoing review of health care practices, underpinned by clear documentation of changes in practice and learnings, will be critical to maintaining optimal and sustainable value-based cancer care into the future.""

How did California go from COVID-19 epicenter to lowest statewide transmission rate?,https://6abc.com/california-covid-19-infection-rate-vaccination-requirements-vaccine-mandates/11165638/,,['ABCNews'],https://vcl.abcotv.net/video/wpvi/102521-wpvi-covid-vaccine-GMA-vid.mp4,"""We can't know for sure which factors are responsible,"" an epidemiologist said, ""but we know that the combination of interventions and policies can play a really strong role in driving transmission.""",,2021-10-25 12:21:01,"LOS ANGELES -- With the lowest COVID-19 infection rate among all states as of Friday, California, which has some of the strictest mask and vaccination mandates in the country, has managed to flip the script as the former U.S. epicenter of the pandemic. ""They've been very much forward-thinking in terms of policies around vaccination requirements and mandates,"" said epidemiologist Dr. John Brownstein, chief innovation officer at Boston Children's Hospital and an ABC News contributor. As of Friday evening, California had an infection rate of 61.1 cases per 100,000 over the past week, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The state was briefly the only to be classified with a ""moderate"" rate of transmission -- 10 to 49.99 cases per 100,000 over seven days -- before it went back up to ""substantial,"" meaning 50 to 99.99 cases per 100,000 over seven days. Over the previous week, Hawaii, Florida, Louisiana, Connecticut, New Jersey, Mississippi, Maryland, Georgia and Washington, D.C., each also reported ""substantial"" rates. A rate of at least 100 cases per 100,000 is labeled as ""high."" Montana, Wyoming, Idaho and Alaska, as of Friday, had the highest rates over the previous seven days, with each above 450 cases per 100,000 people. The U.S. average over that span was 150.9. Experts said California's journey from worst to first is likely due to a combination of things. ""We can't know for sure which factors are responsible,"" Brownstein added, ""but we know that the combination of interventions and policies can play a really strong role in driving transmission."" 'Ending this pandemic' More than 70% of California's population has received at least one dose of vaccine, according to the CDC , and the state also leads in total vaccinations administered, roughly 53 million doses. As of Friday, the national average rate was 66.2%. Being the first state to announce a COVID-19 vaccine requirement for schools, California has some of the strictest mandates in the U.S. The state has mandated vaccines for state employees, health care workers, teachers and at large indoor gatherings. ""The more aggressive the vaccination campaign, the better,"" Dr. Todd Ellerin, director of infectious diseases at South Shore Health, told ABC News. Given that vaccines are the most powerful tool we have in curbing the spread of COVID-19, experts said they believe California's emphasis on immunizations has provided big dividends. ""These results show quite clearly that vaccines offer protection for individuals who lack immunity, with important implications for finally ending this pandemic,"" Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, wrote in a blog post Tuesday. Idaho and Wyoming have some of the lowest vaccination rates and the highest transmission rates. All three COVID-19 vaccines available in the U.S. have since shown high effectiveness in preventing death due to COVID-19, and as of Friday, California boasted the lowest death rate in the country, with 0.3 per 100,000 over the previous week. The U.S. average over that span was 2.7 per 100,000. Additionally, experts told ABC News, having endured the harshest waves of infections last winter and the delta surge in July, formerly infected Californians may have acquired antibodies and more of a natural immunity to COVID-19 -- both factors that, in concert with vaccines, could be driving down case numbers. 'More work to do' In addition to strict vaccine mandates, California has been unwavering on face-coverings, testing and social distancing policies. ""While California has administered more vaccines than any other state, we have more work to do,"" the California Department of Public Health said in a statement to ABC News. Everyone, regardless of vaccination status, is required to wear a mask on public transit, in health care settings and at educational and correctional facilities. Masks are required for all unvaccinated people and recommended for vaccinated people in settings such as theaters, retail stores, restaurants and bars. Despite having a higher vaccination rate than California, states like Vermont are still falling behind on transmission rate rankings, which experts said points to the importance of distancing and masking. Breakthrough cases seen in Vermont can be further explained by its higher proportion of residents 65 and older. Mobility Research shows mobility, or movement in populations, can be a predictor of disease spread, especially via air travel or mass transit. This became evident through the surge of COVID-19 cases the U.S. saw during holiday season. Gov. Gavin Newsom pleaded with California residents on Christmas Eve to avoid holiday gatherings at a time when hospitals in the state were under ""unprecedented pressure."" Californian cities experienced a huge surge of cases and hospitalizations following the holidays, although rates have since declined. No stranger to stay-at-home orders, the California government imposed several lockdowns and restrictions to curb the spread of the virus. It celebrated its most recent reopening in mid-June, which replaced 15-month-long public health restrictions with conditions more akin to ""business as usual."" ""In the height of the pandemic, people were locked down, they weren't moving at all, they were staying at home,"" Brownstein told ABC News. ""The more people move around, that's usually an indicator for increased transmission."" The great outdoors The virus has been shown to spread more indoors and with people in close proximity to one another. California's sunny climate means more people spend more time outside. ""When we spend most of our time indoors, that's when transmission is greatest,"" Ellerin said. Added Brownstein: ""More close contacts with people outside your household indoors is what creates additional risk."" This effect is also compounded by the rise in the virus' effective reproductive number during the winter season with research suggesting that a drop in temperature encourages virus growth. Compared to many other states, especially as winter draws nearer, California is in ""quite a good spot,"" Brownstein said. ""In all likelihood, the trends that we're seeing are realistic and very much driven by compliance with masking and other interventions, plus the well-covered vaccination strategy in the state.""

Dorset Council reveals £37.5m plan for children with additional needs,https://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/news/19671722.dorset-council-reveals-37-5m-plan-children-additional-needs/?ref=rss,,,,DORSET Council has revealed how it is spending £37.5m of funding earmarked to improve the lives of children with additional needs - including the creation of new schools.,,2021-10-26 04:00:00,"READ MORE: Dorset Council's new £37.5m plan for children with additional needs The council developed the plans in response to the growing need for more special educational provision - with young people with Education, Health and Care Plans in Dorset nearly doubling between 2015 and 2020. Currently some children and young people with SEND must travel a great distance for educational provision, sometimes outside of the county, because there's not enough specialist provision available in Dorset. The council's roadmap to deliver the programme includes a scheme to open the Dorset Centre of Excellence – a new school in Shaftesbury based on the former St Mary's site to open with an initial 60 additional places in the 2021/22 academic year, with further phasing as it seeks to achieve 280 places in total over the subsequent years. The council is also working towards opening an additional site for Wimborne's Beaucroft Special School – which will bring approximately 75 additional places in 2022/23. The investment is also set to go towards the expansion of Inclusion Hubs across Dorset which will provide provision attached to mainstream schools. It is hoped that Inclusion Hubs will support children with SEND so that they can access the mainstream classroom, but also allow space to support children when they need more specialist support. The move expects to achieve an expansion of over 100 places over the next 5 years. Independent provision costs around £60,000 a year per child, whereas high quality provision at one of Dorset's own special schools costs around £22,000 a year per child. The SEND Capital Strategy aims to increase local provision and reduce some of these costs in the longer term. Cllr Andrew Parry, Dorset Council Portfolio Holder for Children, Education and Early Help, said; “Dorset Council is making a big investment in education and support for children with SEND and it’s of huge importance to us. We've developed these ambitious plans because the need for more SEND provision is growing fast and we want all our children and young people to have the best possible outcomes – to thrive. “This bold and ambitious strategy will focus on achieving the best education for all Dorset’s children and young people with SEND, while avoiding the need for a child to travel away from their family and friend networks to receive their education or support.” CONTACT ME: t: 01305 830999 e: marie-claire.alfonso @newsquest.co.uk twitter: @MCAlfonsoJourno",https://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/resources/images/13137168/,dorsetecho

Centers for Disease Control Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky remains coy on whether the Biden administration would support COVID-19 vaccine mandates for essential workers or students . President Biden signed an executive order on Sept. 9 that required federal employees to receive a vaccine. Some cities have enacted similar policies despite immense resistance from the very workers the policies intended to protect. VACCINE MANDATES CREATE CONFLICT WITH DEFIANT WORKERS Walensky refused to be drawn on direct comments regarding support for further vaccine mandates - particularly, one for essential workers. Instead, she focused on the need for vaccines and the ways in which the administration would encourage workers to get the vaccine. ""The most disruptive thing you can do to a workforce is to have a Covid outbreak in that workforce,"" Walensky told "" Fox News Sunday "" host Chris Wallace. ""That will most definitely not only send people home but it will send people to the hospital and some may pass."" Walensky said that the administration has ""a plan"" to encourage vaccinations and would point the more hesitant essential workers towards ""education and counseling to get people the information they need."" She cited numbers that showed that more police officers over the past year have died from COVID-19 than from all other causes of death combined. OBAMA: ‘I UNDERSTAND’ WHY AMERICANS WANT TO KNOW WHEN COVID-19 MANDATES WILL END' Police have remained a particularly resistant group. Major cities including Chicago and Los Angeles have enacted mandates for the police force, with New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio weighing his own possible mandate. A New York City police union has threatened legal action over a possible mandate, even though 70% of officers have already been vaccinated. Walensky also avoided a question on whether the administration would support a vaccine mandate for school-aged children. She discussed the need to get authorization and approval before discussing any mandates. NSBA's ‘DOMESTIC TERRORISM’ APOLOGY FALLS FLAT: ‘THESE ARE PARENTS, NOT TERRORISTS,’ DR. SAPHIER SAYS ""Right now we are at authorization, we're having discussions about authorization, so I think we need to get children vaccinated through this authorization and get to approval before we can make a judgment there,"" Walensky said. California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Oct. 1 signed a vaccine requirement for eligible school children to attend in-person lessons. The mandate, which does provide medical and personal belief exemptions, has prompted protests from some parents who suggest pulling their children out of school.

(Nasdaq: ERAS), a clinical-stage precision oncology company singularly focused on discovering, developing, and commercializing therapies for patients with RAS/MAPK pathway-driven cancers, today announced the presentation of preclinical data for ERAS-801, a small molecule epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor specifically designed to have high central nervous system (CNS) penetration for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Special Virtual Conference on Brain Cancer. “While mutations in EGFR are common oncogenic drivers in glioblastoma, approved EGFR inhibitors lack both sufficient CNS penetration for primary brain tumors and clinical activity against oncogenic EGFR alterations that are prevalent in GBM,” said Jonathan E. Lim, M.D., Erasca’s chairman, CEO, and co-founder. “ERAS-801 is an EGFR inhibitor with four times the CNS penetrance of approved EGFR inhibitors, resulting in robust CNS enrichment while limiting systemic exposure. In more than 30 GBM patient-derived preclinical models, ERAS-801 demonstrated potent activity across mutant and wildtype oncogenic EGFR alterations, and we are highly encouraged by the extensive therapeutic potential of ERAS-801 for patients with this aggressive malignancy.” David A. Nathanson, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), added, “About 60% of glioblastomas are driven by oncogenic alterations in EGFR that include amplifications and mutations such as the highly prevalent vIII deletion. Wildtype EGFR has a pathogenic role in glioblastoma and can drive disease following amplification or through heterodimerization with mutant EGFR. Effective disease control of glioblastoma ultimately requires comprehensive inhibition of both mutated and wildtype forms of EGFR, which approved EGFR inhibitors do not currently achieve. Our work demonstrates that ERAS-801 can improve outcomes in over 90% of diverse EGFR-driven patient-derived tumor models, highlighting a comprehensive inhibitory profile that has robust potential to effectively treat patients with CNS cancers with poor prognosis.” About ERAS-801 ERAS-801 is a highly potent, selective, and reversible small molecule EGFR inhibitor with significantly enhanced CNS penetration. ERAS-801 has a 3.7:1 brain-to-plasma ratio and a K p,uu (partition coefficient that measures unbound drug concentration) that is up to four times higher than approved EGFR inhibitors, indicating a higher concentration of unbound drug in the brain compared to the blood. Utilizing fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), a pharmacodynamic marker of metabolically active tumors, the Nathanson lab evaluated inhibition of tumor metabolism in over 30 patient-derived preclinical glioblastoma models following treatment with different FDA-approved EGFR inhibitors. At clinically relevant exposures, ERAS-801 demonstrated a survival benefit in over 90% of EGFR mutant and/or amplified glioblastoma patient-derived models tested to date and had statistically significantly higher brain penetrance and prolonged survival compared to approved EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. ERAS-801 was designed and developed by a renowned team of UCLA cancer researchers—David Nathanson, Ph.D., Michael Jung, Ph.D., and Timothy Cloughesy, M.D. Erasca plans to submit an IND filing for development in refractory GBM in the first quarter of 2022.

"Amid 'great resignation,' group calls for more fertility benefits coverage",https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/amid-great-resignation-group-calls-for-more-fertility-benefits-coverage-1.5637635,,['Marlene Leung'],,"As Canadian firms struggle to fill job vacancies, one advocacy group is calling on companies to increase their benefits coverage to include fertility treatments.",,2021-10-25 20:22:00,"TORONTO -- As Canadian firms struggle to fill job vacancies, one advocacy group is calling on companies to increase their benefits coverage to include fertility treatments. A recent survey from the Business Development Bank of Canada found that 55 per cent of Canadian small and medium-sized employers are struggling to hire the workers they need. The survey also found that more than 26 per cent are having a hard time retaining their staff. According to the survey, which also polled employees, a desire for higher wages was the primary reason workers planned to change jobs in the next year, followed by increased benefits. Tara Wood, board president of the advocacy group Conceivable Dreams, says now, amid the “great resignation,” is the “perfect time” for society to be having discussions on what kinds of fertility benefits employers can offer their workers. “COVID has shown us that there’s a different way to live,” she told CTVNews.ca in a phone interview. “People are looking for their employers to step up.” FERTILITY BENEFITS IN CANADA Fertility benefits can cover a wide range of treatments, including procedures, such as intrauterine insemination (IUI), in vitro fertilization (IVF), testing and egg freezing, as well as the cost of fertility drugs. The cost of treatments can range from an average $400 per year for egg, sperm or embryo storage to up to $20,000 per cycle of IVF. Infertility affects one in six Canadian couples, a number that has doubled since the 1980s, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada . While there has been an increase in the number of American companies offering fertility coverage in their health-care plans, Canadian companies have been slower to adapt, says Wood. “I started meeting with employers last year,” Wood said. “There’s certainly appetite (for providing fertility benefits), but there’s a big difference between saying these policies make sense and actually doing it. Talking about doing it and actually doing it are two different things, and very few are doing it in Canada right now.” Earlier this year, Conceivable Dreams released the findings of a study that reviewed employer benefit plans in Canada. The review included a sample of small to large employers, across all provinces and in all industries. The study found that the majority of Canadian employers do not offer any fertility benefits. Of those companies that did offer fertility benefits, the average lifetime coverage was $3,250. As well, only five per cent provided coverage for both fertility drugs and the costs of fertility procedures, the study found. COMPANIES ‘WALKING THE TALK’ Aside from helping out employees with the financial cost of infertility, providing fertility benefits shows employees that companies are “walking the talk” when it comes to creating inclusive policies, says Woods. Fertility for most women starts to decline in their 30s, which often forces women to make a choice mid-career between starting a family or continuing on their career path. “If an employer is truly dedicated to gender equity within their organizations, these types of benefits, are really important, because it allows people to choose when they want to have a family,” Wood said. “When we have options like egg freezing (coverage), which allows that couple to have that child five, six years down the road, that’s a huge benefit.” Fertility benefits that cover a range of treatments would also help LGBTQ2S+ couples who are looking to have a child, as well as lower-income families or single people who may not have the financial means to pursue fertility treatments, she added. “We all need to play a role in making fertility more accessible.” NEW ‘MINIMUM STANDARDS’ While employers may have concerns about increasing the price of their benefit plans, adding fertility coverage doesn’t have to substantially add to your bottom line, says Yafa Sakkejha, CEO of Beneplan. Beneplan, which is an intermediary between employers and insurance companies, recently introduced a new series of “minimum health standards” to all their benefit plans, including coverage of $2,500 per lifetime for fertility drugs. Sakkejha said her underwriters found that offering $2,500 in fertility coverage, resulted in an increase in the health premium by less than one per cent. She said since making the addition to the plans, over 90 per cent of her clients are choosing to renew it, with both management and HR departments getting on board. “This is win-win-win,” Sakkejha told CTVNews.ca, noting that it a step in the right direction. “We’re starting to inch towards better coverage.” Related Stories Party leaders pledge to support workers with more benefits Pregnancy, birth and fertility care need to be more gender inclusive, advocates say These Canadian industries are currently facing the biggest labour shortages Ontario fertility clinics left in limbo after directive to cease non-emergency procedures Share: Reddit Share Report an error Editorial standards and policies Why you can trust CTV News More Health Stories Amid 'great resignation,' group calls for more fertility benefits coverage Cannabis vaping doubled among teens in Canada, U.S. since 2013: study Rise in teen girls with 'tic-like' behaviours could be linked to TikTok, doctors say Quebec study shows childhood TB vaccine may not offer long-term protection against COVID-19 China to start vaccinating children as young as 3 against COVID-19 Parents more hesitant to vaccinate kids than themselves, researcher says Canadian entrepreneur gifts $5 million to help create psychedelic research centre for mental health Aromatherapy spray recalled in U.S. linked to deaths in four states First of its kind website aims to provide resources about palliative care for kids Top Videos false Woman throws hot coffee at employee in possible hate crime false Police in Kingston, Ont. crackdown on huge student parties false What is a 'bomb cyclone'?

Wild lettuce is just one such plant that has been used this way, usually for pain relief and to aid sleep. Wild lettuce ( lactuca virosa ) has recently shown promise in research as both a nootropic (a substance that can help improve cognitive function) and painkiller. The powerful plant is a part of the Asteraceae plant family which has 23,600 species around the globe (making it a member of one the largest plant families worldwide), and is usually found in various areas of the world including Iran, Austria, France, Germany, and Scotland. Because of its psychoactive properties, wild lettuce is sometimes used recreationally by people looking for a natural buzz. What are the benefits of wild lettuce? Wild lettuce contains two beneficial compounds (lactucin and lactucopicrin) that act on the central nervous system as a painkiller and sedative. Wild lettuce has the highest concentration of lactucopicrin of all plants, and is also meant to have potent antimicrobial properties. Certain types of sesquiterpene lactones found in wild lettuce can even help to reduce inflammation, potentially alleviating pain from specific ailments like arthritis. A study in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology in 2018 found that lactucopicrin actually increased neuritogenesis in brain cells extracted from lab rats, which is promising in terms of helping fight Alzheimer’s disease. Neuritogenesis is a phenomenon in which nerve cells sprout neurites (projections), that connect one nerve cell to another, strengthening the transmission of nerve signals. Based on these properties, it is thought that wild lettuce may be able to help prevent or alleviate certain conditions including: Alzheimer’s disease Arthritis Asthma Atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) Coughs Hyperactivity Insomnia Joint pain Malaria Menstrual pain To find out more about the potential benefits and side effects of wild lettuce pain killer , head over to the Fresh Bros website or get in touch with a team member today!

New advice issued by Dorset's public health chief amid rising covid cases,https://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/news/19671074.new-advice-issued-dorsets-public-health-chief-amid-rising-covid-cases/?ref=rss,,,,THE DIRECTOR of Public Health Dorset has issued new advice following a 'rapid' rise in covid cases.,,2021-10-25 13:59:15,"""In other parts of the South West we're seeing councils with cases reaching seven and eight hundred cases per hundred thousand, so we need to do something differently and we need to understand that the situation is changing."" Mr Crowe said local hospital admissions have started to climb despite 'holding fairly steady in the last week.' He added: ""Not all of these infections are linked with schools, although we have high infection rates in school-aged children. They're now starting to affect older age groups so we're seeing infections in parents and we're also seeing this spread into older age groups and that's the concern."" ""In our local system which is already really stressed, we don't have much room for manoeuvre. Any additional admissions due to covid just put more pressure on the hospital system, which is really trying hard to catch up with all of those people who have had delays to their urgent treatment during the pandemic."" Mr Crowe has asked the public to do three things to prevent cases from rising further: ""Know your risk and understand that this is changing quite quickly with rising cases so think about those additional measures you can take to protect yourself and others. ""I'm asking you to act: airborne transmission is really crucial that's how the virus spreads, so think about those measures that can prevent that happening. If you're meeting indoors remember to keep doors and windows open, ventilation is really crucial. Wear a mask if you're mixing with other people you wouldn't normally mix with in enclosed indoor areas and remember the importance of distance as well. ""Finally protect, so remember lateral flow testing is really important for spotting early cases and asymptomatic cases of covid. Also, if you haven't had your vaccination or you're not up to date with your second jab, please do look out for those opportunities to get fully vaccinated."" Mr Crowe also addressed the roll out of the booster vaccination programme in Dorset asking those who have been contacted, to ""please take up that opportunity."" In a final statement the Public Health Dorset Director said: ""Over the next few weeks, I'm just asking you to do all you can to try to help us keep a lid on our cases. ""None of us want to go back to that situation where we saw restrictions being brought in, we've got a small window now where if we act together, hopefully we can stave off the need to bring in more serious measures further down the line. So, let's keep going thank you.""",https://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/resources/images/13135837/,dorsetecho

Musician Arturo Fermill, also known as D.J. Buddha Sax, says the demand of his services has only declined since the province’s announcement that capacity limits would be lifted. “I would usually have, in normal times, twenty to thirty gigs booked for Christmas parties, corporate events, even winter weddings right up until Christmas Eve but I currently have one that’s a ‘maybe,’ which will be eventually be cancelled due to the fact that their employees aren’t able to dance on the dance floor.” Story continues below advertisement Fermill believes the province underestimated how much revenue would be lost by B.C. small businesses when they chose to leave ‘indoor event dancing’ off the list of activities that were now allowed. “We now need the government to not have this oversight, because it really is an oversight.” Read more: B.C. lifting COVID-19 capacity limits on gatherings for much of province Micheal Ghirra, who is the owner of Riverside Banquet Halls, said the no-dancing rules and mask mandate have continued to dry up his business as well. “The announcement was great that we are at 100 per cent capacity at our banquet halls, but nothing has really changed with our businesses and our clients — they’re still not booking,” said Ghirra. “With Christmas parties, we typically do about 30 to 35 corporate events a year, but this year we’re down to, like, six — and out of those six, we just got a call last week that, because of the no-dancing and indoor-masking rules, that they’re just going to postpone until next year.” Meanwhile, Connolly is asking the province to make a decision this week on whether dancing will be allowed and the indoor-mask mandate lifted for indoor events so event organizers and staff can plan accordingly for the holiday season.

Ministry of Health pointed to earlier comments made by Dr. Bonnie Henry last week, highlighting her response to dancing not being allowed at live event venues. “We are watching that carefully and I hope to be able to take off more restrictions as we get through the next few months,” Henry had said at last Tuesday’s press conference. Although Connolly said she would prefer if both the indoor-mask mandate and dancing restrictions were lifted, there is one that would allow her businesses to thrive more. “If I had to pick one or the other, I would definitely say let us dance.” © 2021 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.",https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CP127988159.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=720&h=480&crop=1,globalnews

(Theratechnologies) (TSX: TH) (NASDAQ: THTX), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies, is pleased to announce that it has reached an agreement with the Italian Medicines Agency, AIFA, for the reimbursement of Trogarzo ® for eligible people aged 18 and older living with multi-drug resistant (MDR) HIV-1. “This agreement is an important milestone for Trogarzo ® and for HIV-1 patients in Italy,” said Conor Walshe, General Manager, Europe. “Italy is the first country with a universal healthcare plan that has approved the formal reimbursement of Trogarzo ® for all patients in need. We expect to launch Trogarzo ® in Italy during the current quarter and look forward to its wider commercial availability in Europe over the coming months.” Trogarzo ® was first approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2018 and was the first long-acting agent approved for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in heavily treatment-experienced adults with MDR HIV-1 infection failing their current antiretroviral regimen. Trogarzo ® was approved by the European Medical Agency (EMA) in September 2019 for the treatment of adults infected with MDR HIV-1 for whom it is otherwise not possible to construct a suppressive antiviral regimen and is also commercially available in Germany. A number of patients are also being treated with Trogarzo ® in other European countries through early access programs. Theratechnologies plans to launch Trogarzo ® on a country-by-country basis across Europe as it gains reimbursement in each individual country. In addition, the Company received regulatory approval in Israel for Trogarzo ® and is working to secure pricing and reimbursement. About Trogarzo ® 1 Trogarzo ® a humanized monoclonal antibody of immunoglobulin G type 4 (IgG4), is a CD4 domain 2-directed HIV-1 inhibitor. Trogarzo ® blocks HIV-1 from infecting CD4+ T cells by binding to domain 2 of CD4 and interfering with the post-attachment steps required for the entry of HIV-1 virus particles into host cells and preventing the viral transmission that occurs via cell-cell fusion. Trogarzo ® is administered every 2 weeks via intravenous infusion. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were rash (9.2%), diarrhea (3.9%), dizziness (3.9%), headache (3.9%), nausea (3.9%), fatigue (2.0%) and vomiting (2.0%).

How to support a person with dementia as lockdowns ease,https://theconversation.com/how-to-support-a-person-with-dementia-as-lockdowns-ease-169462,,"['Lee-Fay Low', ' Professor in Ageing and Health', ' University of Sydney']",,,"ShutterstockLockdowns lasting months in some states have seen tight restrictions on visitors to nursing homes. So as lockdowns ease, and if you’re vaccinated, you might be planning a happy reunion with your friend or family. If your loved one has dementia, you might be wondering if their symptoms have worsened in lockdown, or if they remember who you are. Here’s what to look out for on your first visit after lockdowns end, and how to support your loved one after that. Read more: Why people with dementia don't all behave the same Expect some decline Lockdowns can result in decline in people with dementia, particularly those living in nursing homes. Research from lockdowns in 2020 showed people with dementia had more trouble thinking and problem solving. Their behaviour and mood worsened. Some studies showed people were less able to do things around the home or look after themselves. Keeping mentally, physically and socially active helps people with dementia maintain their brain and thinking. But in lockdown, when people with dementia did less, they exercised their brains and bodies less. Read more: How best to celebrate Christmas with a person with dementia Lockdowns not only meant a ban on visitors to nursing homes, but limited stimulation from group activities, such as concerts, visits from schools and bus outings. During lockdowns, nursing home residents (more than half have dementia) also got worse in terms of their thinking and well-being. Residents sometimes didn’t understand why they couldn’t move freely around the nursing home, and why their loved ones had stopped visiting. This led to increases in behaviours, such as agitation. After lockdowns began, there has been an increase in prescriptions of psychotropic medications reported internationally. These medications are used in nursing homes to manage behaviours such as aggression and agitation. The first visit can be difficult Some families might be worried about their first visit in several months to a person living with dementia. They might be concerned their loved one has gotten worse, or scared they won’t recognise them. But it may help to think of visits as providing really important mental stimulation and human connection for your loved one, even though visits might be difficult emotionally for you. Introduce yourself: “Hi Dad, it’s Ali”, if it looks like your loved one can’t quite place who you are or your name. Read their reactions to you. If they need time to warm up to you (which might be disappointing if you are close), chat with someone else who is there. The person might enjoy your company even if they aren’t actively participating in the conversation at first. Prepare an activity to do together, based on their interests. Shutterstock Then invite them to participate in the conversation by asking them their opinion: “How is the dog going?” or “I’m looking forward to going to the hairdresser, how about you?”. Prepare an activity to do together based on their interests. You could walk in the garden, browse a magazine about the royal family, sing along to a favourite album. If it’s a noisy gathering, find a quiet spot for one-on-one conversation, as the person may have trouble focusing when there are several people talking at once. Read more: Five tips on how to talk to kids about dementia Let them know when you’ll be back Because of your long separation, your loved one might be quite emotional or clingy when you are leaving. Let them know when you’ll be coming again. You can write this down in their calendar, or on a card to give them. You can also tell the nursing home staff so they can remind them. You can also leave a visual reminder of your visit. This could be a card or photograph, or some flowers with a note. If possible, get back into a visiting routine. You could leave some flowers and card as a physical reminder of your visit. Shutterstock If you notice a decline Families are more likely to notice small or marked changes in their loved one’s abilities if they have not seen them for several months. That might mean noticing early signs of dementia or worsening symptoms if they’ve already been diagnosed with it. So this can be a delicate conversation to have with your loved one. Many people can be defensive or in denial about changes, put it down to “old age”, and are afraid about having dementia. You might need to have the conversation several times to get them to see the doctor. Call the National Dementia Helpline on 1800 100 500 for advice. Read more: How to check if your mum or dad's nursing home is up to scratch In the longer term, consider rehab Rehabilitation helps people with dementia. So it’s worth looking into what support services your loved one might need. A psychologist can help with strategies to manage memory and thinking; an occupational therapist can help with doing day-to-day things around the house; an exercise physiologist or physiotherapist can help with mobility; and a speech pathologist can help with communication. Family carers can talk to their loved one’s dementia specialist, or ask their GP for a Chronic Disease Management Plan for some subsidised rehabilitation sessions. If you’re not the main carer If you’re not the main family carer, make sure that person has some support. Ask how they are feeling and what support you can offer. Carers have been providing more help during lockdowns to people with dementia living in the community. That’s because there have been fewer services on offer, and as people with dementia needed help to comply with restrictions. Offer to spend some time with the person with dementia so the carer can have a break. Or take the carer out for a meal and some social time now restrictions have eased.

"Walmart recalls room spray for ""rare and dangerous"" bacteria",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/deadly-bacteria-room-spray-walmart-recall/,,,,CDC urges consumers not to even open recalled bottles and use gloves in returning them to the retailer.,,2021-10-25 12:13:20,"Walmart is recalling room spray sold nationwide due to the possible presence of what federal regulators called a ""rare and dangerous"" bacteria that is linked to two deaths, including a child. The retailer sold about 3,900 bottles of Better Homes and Gardens-branded-Essential Oil Infused Aromatherapy Room Spray with Gemstones in six different scents, according to a recall notice posted Friday by the Consumer Protection Safety Commission. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tested a sample of the product this week and found it contained the bacteria Burkholderia pseudomallei, which causes melioidosis, a rare but serious disease with about a dozen cases reportedly annually in the U.S. The recall comes two months after the CDC warned the bacterial disease had caused two deaths and urged doctors to be on the lookout for more cases. Consumers are urged not to use — or even open — the recalled spray. Instead, they are advised to wear gloves and double bag the bottles in zip-top clear resealable bags, which should be placed in a small cardboard box and returned to a Walmart store for a refund. The company is also offering a $20 Walmart gift card for customers who return the product. Any surfaces or fabrics that may have been sprayed with the product would be wiped down or washed. The five-ounce glass bottles of room spray retailed for about $4 each, and were sold in in about 55 stores and online from February through October. One of six scents of aromatherapy room spray recalled by Walmart. U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Walmart has stopped selling the product, which was made in India and sold with a pump spray nozzle in the following scents and product numbers: 84140411420 Better Homes and Gardens (BHG) Gem Room Spray Lavender & Chamomile 84140411421 Better Homes and Gardens (BHG) Gem Room Spray Lemon and Mandarin 84140411422 Better Homes and Gardens (BHG) Gem Room Spray Lavender 84140411423 Better Homes and Gardens (BHG) Gem Room Spray Peppermint 84140411424 Better Homes and Gardens (BHG) Gem Room Spray Lime & Eucalyptus 84140411425 Better Homes and Gardens (BHG) Gem Room Spray Sandalwood and Vanilla Most cases of melioidosis occur in people who live in or have traveled to areas where the bacteria naturally occurs, such as parts of Asia and Australia, as well as occasionally in Brazil, Mexico and Puerto Rico. It causes a wide range of symptoms that can be confused with other common illnesses, like flu or a cold, according to the CDC. The bacteria detected in the bottles is the same type that sickened four people earlier this year, with one of the recalled sprays found October 6 in the home of a Georgia resident stricken with melioidosis in late July, according to the agency. The CDC is conducting tests to determine if the genetic fingerprint of the bacteria in the bottle matches those found in three other patients, the agency said Friday in a statement . ""Our hearts go out to the families that have been impacted by this situation,"" Dr. Inger Damon, director of CDC's division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, which manages melioidosis, said in a statement. ""Our scientists have continued to work tirelessly to try to find the potential source for the melioidosis infections in these patients. We hope this work can help protect other people who may have used this spray."" Walmart issued a separate statement late Friday. ""We are deeply concerned that there may be a connection between this product and this rare bacteria. Our sympathies and concerns are with the four families that have been impacted. We took immediate action after federal agencies alerted us Wednesday of concerns with an aromatherapy room spray manufactured by Flora Classique Inc. and sold under the Better Homes & Gardens brand. We pulled the product from the shelves of about 55 stores where it was part of a pilot program and put a register block in place at our stores and online to prevent any further sales."" The company also reiterated the importance of handling the products safely and returning to Walmart. The U.S. Department of Defense in June awarded a $3 million contract to the University of Hawaii at Manoa's School of Life Sciences to develop a vaccine for melioidosis, which experts say can be a potential bioterrorism threat.

"AY.4.2 up to 15 per cent more transmissible than Delta, may be named ‘Nu’",https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/health/ay-4-2-up-to-15-per-cent-more-transmissible-than-delta-may-be-named-nu-329006,,,,"London, October 24 A sub-variant of the Covid Delta strain—AY.4.2 -- may be up to 15 per cent more transmissible than the original Delta, scientists estimate. AY.4.2 made up almost 10 per cent of all infections in England in the fortnight ending October 9, the Daily Mail reported. Its prevalence in England doubled in a month from being behind four per cent of cases in September to 8.9 per cent in the two weeks to October 9, said scientists at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. AY.4.2, which is one of 45 sub-lineages of Delta and dubbed by many as Delta plus, is likely to be named as Nu, the report said. The strain could be the most infectious subvariant seen since the pandemic began, Professor Francois Balloux, director of the University College London Genetics Institute, was quoted as saying to the Financial Times. The World Health Organisation will likely elevate AY.4.2 to a ""variant under investigation"", which means it would be given a name under its Greek letter naming system, Balloux added. However, he noted that since the UK is the only country where the sub-lineage has ""taken off"", its quick growth could also be a ""chance demographic event"". ""The emergence of yet another more transmissible strain would be suboptimal. Though, this is not a situation comparable to the emergence of Alpha and Delta that were far more transmissible -- 50 per cent or more—than any strain in circulation at the time,"" Balloux said. ""Here we are dealing with a potential small increase in transmissibility that would not have a comparable impact on the pandemic."" The UK has recorded about 50,000 new Covid infections, marking another three-month high. Hospitalisations and deaths are also on the rise. According to the latest weekly report from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA)—which has replaced Public Health England—revealed Covid cases have risen in all age groups, but are now at a record high among school children. AY.4.2 has spread to all but two dozen places in the country. Some experts have said the subvariant may be behind the surge in cases in the UK, which other European countries are not seeing to the same extent. However, there is yet no evidence that AY.4.2 is more deadly than earlier versions of the Delta strain, which was first identified in India last December, the Daily Mail report said. It includes two mutations—called Y145H and A222V—and is being monitored, the UKHSA said. Both of these spike mutations have been found in other virus lineages since the pandemic began—but are not present on any current variant of concern. — IANS",,2021-10-24 11:40:06,,https://englishtribuneimages.blob.core.windows.net/gallary-content/2021/10/2021_10$largeimg_1281351769.jpeg,tribuneindia
Moderna says its low-dose COVID vaccine works for kids 6 to 11,https://abc13.com/moderna-vaccine-for-kids-who-has-near-me-costco-booster-covid/11166164/,"['moderna vaccine for kids', 'who has moderna vaccine near me', 'costco moderna booster', 'moderna covid vaccine', 'moderna expiration date', 'why is moderna booster half dose']",['AP'],,"Moderna said half-dose shots induced strong levels of virus-fighting antibodies in youngsters, with temporary side effects such as fever and fatigue.",,2021-10-25 16:10:58,"Moderna said Monday that a low dose of its COVID-19 vaccine is safe and appears to work in 6- to 11-year-olds, as the manufacturer moves toward expanding shots to children. Competitor Pfizer's kid-sized vaccine doses are closer to widespread use, undergoing evaluation by the Food and Drug Administration for nearly the same age group - starting at age 5. Its vaccine already is authorized for anyone 12 or older. Moderna hasn't yet gotten the nod to offer its vaccine to teens but is studying lower doses in younger children while it waits. Researchers tested two shots for the 6- to 11-year-olds, given a month apart, that each contained half the dose given to adults. Preliminary results showed vaccinated kids developed virus-fighting antibodies similar to levels that young adults produce after full-strength shots, Moderna said in a press release. The study included 4,753 kids ages 6 to 11, who got either the vaccine or dummy shots. Moderna said that like adults, the vaccinated youngsters had temporary side effects including fatigue, headache, fever and injection site pain. The study was too small to spot any extremely rare side effects, such as heart inflammation that sometimes occurs after either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines, mostly among young men. Moderna said it plans to submit its pediatric data to the FDA and global regulators soon. The FDA hasn't yet ruled on the company's application to expand its vaccinations to 12- to 17-year-olds, although some countries have cleared Moderna's shots for adolescents. But the U.S. is expected to begin vaccinating kids under 12 sometime next month, if the FDA clears small doses of the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine for 5- to 11-year-olds. Pfizer reported last week that its kid-sized doses proved nearly 91% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 in the younger age group, even as the extra-contagious delta variant was spreading widely. FDA's advisers will deliberate Pfizer's evidence in a public meeting Tuesday. If the agency authorizes Pfizer's kid shots, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the following week is set to recommend who should receive them.",,abc13

Stockton triathlon joins Newcastle events list for 2022,https://www.newcastleherald.com.au/story/7480600/stockton-triathlon-joins-newcastle-events-list-for-2022/?src=rss,,['Renee Valentine'],,It will be staged next February.,,2021-10-24 22:30:00,"Event-starved Novocastrians may have been celebrating last week with news of a new running race for the community calendar. I use the word race loosely because for many it will merely be a chance to test themselves after months of lockdown and a barren stretch of cancelled event after cancelled event. Signing up for a fitness event is a fantastic way to add some motivation to your training program. It gives you a clear goal and time frame to work with. You can gradually increase your training workload over time to the distance you have entered. For first-timers this may be geared around just completing the course. For the more experienced a personal best time might be the focus. H Events announced last week they would host Recovery Run Newcastle around the harbour foreshore on November 14. Distances on offer are five kilometres and 10km but entrants must be double vaccinated against coronavirus. The course is flat and a good entry point for those who may have taken up running or walking during lockdown life. You could test yourself on the flat then look for a further challenge in the new year with NewRun's Herald Hill2Harbour 10km on April 3 next year. Recovery Run Newcastle is not the only new event to hit the city's shores. H Events will also stage a triathlon, to be supported by City of Newcastle, at Stockton in February next year. The annual Sparke Helmore Newcastle City Tri around the Newcastle harbour foreshore is usually held in February but has been rescheduled until November next year. H Events director Paul Humphreys said the move opened up the opportunity to offer a triathlon in Stockton in February instead. The Stockton event will be held over three days from February 4 to 6, starting with a fun run on the Friday evening, an aquathlon (swim and run) on the Saturday morning and two triathlon events on the Sunday. They will be a sprint distance course of 750-metre swim, 20km bike and 5km run, and an Olympic course with all distances doubled. ""We're making it a three-day festival,"" Mr Humphreys said. ""It's a flat course, so the sprint distance should suit novices, but there is something for all levels."" Flat means fast for the diehards as well as a comfortable introduction to triathlon for beginners. The beauty of triathlon events is that you can do them solo or in a team. My first triathlon was as part of a team with a work colleague. I did the swim and run leg with a welcome rest in between cheering him through the bike leg. It gave me the confidence to go back the following couple of years and try the full event on my own, albeit the shortest course available. It is just over three months away, which provides ample time to train up for the swim, cycle or run, or perhaps all three. Send your health and fitness news to r.valentine@newcastleherald.com.au.

Can I get a booster shot? Latest guidelines for COVID-19 vaccines,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-vaccine-booster-shots-pfizer-moderna-johnson-and-johnson/,,,,"The CDC recently recommended additional doses for millions of Americans, including all adults who were first vaccinated with Johnson & Johnson's shot.",,2021-10-25 18:37:22,"Up to 99 million Americans are now eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine booster shot, after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week signed off on sweeping new booster recommendations for recipients of Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson's vaccines . Those recommendations came after the Food and Drug Administration updated their emergency use authorizations to allow boosters for all three vaccines. The FDA is also allowing eligible Americans to mix-and-match their booster shots, which means you can choose to receive an additional dose from any of the three brands that are available. Here's what we know so far: Johnson & Johnson recipients The CDC now recommends a booster shot for all adults who were vaccinated with Johnson & Johnson's Janssen COVID-19 vaccine at least two months ago. That comes after the FDA concluded that even the highest estimates of the single-shot vaccine's protection were ""consistently less"" than the mRNA-based vaccines from Pfizer or Moderna. Data presented to the FDA's outside vaccine advisers by Johnson & Johnson says vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic COVID-19 climbed to 94% in the U.S. after a booster shot. A group of the CDC's vaccine advisers also concluded that the risks of rare but serious side effects following a second dose of the vaccine were ""unlikely to be greater"" than after the first dose. However, some of the agency's outside vaccine advisers said they would probably counsel their patients at higher risk of a rare blood clotting side effect linked to the Janssen vaccine to opt for a dose of Pfizer or Moderna instead. Out of more than 15 million recipients in the U.S. of Johnson & Johnson's vaccine, the CDC and FDA have confirmed close to 50 reports of the condition known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome. Most were women under 50 years old. ""I was personally not going to recommend a booster dose of the same product of Janssen, so I'm glad that we have included the mix-and-match,"" Dr. Pablo Sanchez, one of the CDC's vaccine advisers, said last week at the committee's meeting to discuss booster shots. Pfizer and Moderna recipients Currently, all seniors 65 and older who received Pfizer or Moderna's COVID-19 vaccines are recommended to get a booster shot at least six months after they were first vaccinated. The CDC also expanded eligibility for adults ages 18 and up who were vaccinated six months ago if they live in ""long-term care settings,"" have ""underlying medical conditions,"" or are working or living in ""high-risk settings"" like prisons, hospitals or homeless shelters. People at higher risk of exposure from their jobs — including teachers and school support staff, grocery clerks, postal workers, factory workers, public transit crews, police and first responders, and others — are also eligible. Like with earlier booster shot recommendations for immunocompromised recipients , most pharmacies and providers are relying only on people's ""self-attestation"" and not requiring proof of eligibility for the additional shots. FDA and CDC officials say they could further expand eligibility for booster shots soon as authorities gather more data on the need and potential risks. ""There is evidence to suggest potentially that lowering the age of those eligible for boosters may make sense in the future. Something we're looking at closely,"" Dr. Peter Marks, the FDA's top vaccines official, told reporters last week. Those risks include myocarditis and pericarditis, rare heart side effects linked to the mRNA-based Pfizer and Moderna vaccines that have occurred mostly in young males. These cases have been mostly mild and typically resolve within a day, according to federal health officials, but often require hospitalization. Data presented to the CDC's outside vaccine advisers last week suggested the risk of myocarditis could be ""slightly increased"" in adults under 30 after Moderna's first two doses compared to Pfizer's. However, some experts hope Moderna's decision to halve the size of its booster dose — 50 micrograms instead of the 100 micrograms of its first two shots — could cut the risk of myocarditis after the booster. Data from Pfizer's booster rollout in Israel, which was presented to the FDA's vaccine advisers earlier this month , also suggests the risk of myocarditis was lower after the third dose while effectively curbing a surge in COVID-19 cases there. ""We may well get there. It's a matter of having the data, and ensuring that when we make that decision, the benefits clearly outweigh the risks throughout the population,"" Marks said. Mix-and-match boosters The FDA's decision to allow for mixing-and-matching booster shots was based in part on early data from trials led by the National Institutes of Health which suggest all combinations of so-called ""heterologous"" boosting are safe and effective at increasing protection. Federal health officials also pointed to situations that made requirements to match booster shot brands tricky, like when people do not remember which shots they were first vaccinated with, had a bad reaction to their initial vaccinations, or do not have access to the same brand at their nearby pharmacies. So far, the FDA's scientists concluded there is not enough data from the NIH's trial to pick a ""preferred strategy"" for boosting. The study's scientists had cautioned that their trial was not designed to ""directly compare"" the immune response triggered by different booster combinations. ""We will not articulate a preference. My understanding is that most people will have done largely well with the initial vaccine that they got and may express a preference, very much, for the original vaccine series they got, having done very well,"" CDC Director Rochelle Walensky told reporters last week . ""There may be some people who might prefer another vaccine over the one that they received, and the current CDC recommendations now make that possible.""

Do you have trouble sleeping?

It began with a workplace visit from a sleep consultant. “I suddenly realised I knew nothing about sleep and decided to start learning,” smiles the Dublin mum-of-one. “I became a bit sleep obsessed.” B ut the reason behind the obsession was personal — Sine couldn’t sleep and soon realised several factors were at play. “It was a combination of recurrent miscarriages and high stress in my job,” explains Sine, who worked in tech at the time. “I wasn’t sleeping and initially I thought, ‘I’ll just have to get on with it’, but when I started learning about how badly lack of sleep could impact my health, I decided I needed to change. I needed to solve this problem.” She now believes she has cracked the issue, with a new product that she hopes can also change other sleep-deprived lives. Sleep is something many of us struggle with. Only 20pc of Irish people believe they’re getting enough sleep and, in a poll of 14 countries, Ireland ranked second only to the UK for reports of bad sleep. Sine then left her job. The move was primarily motivated by a desire to spend more time with her six-year-old daughter, but the mental space freed up by leaving work gave her the opportunity to pursue a new endeavour. She set up Siest Sleep, a sleep solutions business that has created a weighted ‘sleeper’ — a unique pillow, hand-made in Ireland, that aims to help with a host of sleep problems. Weighted blankets have been around for a while but weighted pillows like the Siest sleeper range are something new to the Irish market. “It’s the first weighted pillow so it’s currently going through the patent process at the moment,” reveals Sine. “I find weighted blankets claustrophobic and too hot, and my husband didn’t like them either. I wanted something you could hug and that’s how the weighted sleeper is different.” There’s something very primal about the power of hugging. “When you get a hug from someone you care about, it makes your heartbeat naturally slow down,” explains Sine. “The pillows give that calming feel of someone holding you and comforting you. The concept is that if you feel hugged, it can calm your mind, relax, and that might help you sleep better.” Expand Close The weighted pillow which is part of the Siest sleeper range / Facebook Twitter Email Whatsapp The weighted pillow which is part of the Siest sleeper range Home & Property Get the best home, property and gardening stories straight to your inbox every Saturday. Enter email address This field is required Sign Up We also all know the joy of turning over to the cool side of the pillow, but creating her weighted sleepers using tencel, a cooling, sustainable plant-made fabric that doesn’t get hot and sticky, was something particularly important to Sine. Before getting pregnant with her daughter she suffered a miscarriage and went on to have five other miscarriages in the years after. The experience of loss isn’t something she wants to be defined by, but she does see it as an important driver in founding Siest Sleep. “That was what motivated me,” she explains. “Literally not sleeping as a result of stress and miscarriages. I thought, ‘this can’t be good for me’ and the more I learned about sleep, the more important it became that I found solutions to my sleep.” The hormonal night sweats she experienced relating to miscarriage were a revelation to her. “I know firsthand that when you’re going through something like that, you need something that helps with the sweating,” she says. “Miscarriages can make you have a lot of really hot night sweats — the same with peri-menopause and menopause — and you just feel anxious. “I wanted to make something you could hug and feel emotionally comforted by, something that was super simple because when you’re emotional you don’t have the brain power for anything complicated. You just want something that works quickly to calm you down and also something that would remain cooling and fresh.” She now sleeps nightly with a weighted pillow, as does her daughter. It is, she believes, a ‘universal product’, with customer ages ranging from as young as five, to a growing presence in nursing homes across the country. Parents are buying them for teens battling pandemic-related anxiety while a key demographic is women over 35 who, like Sine, have struggled with stress-related sleeplessness but feel reluctant to go down the route of medication or tech solutions. The Siest Sleep website lists an impressive range of complaints where the pillow can help: easing hip discomfort when used between the knees, helping tummy pains from PMS and combating snoring if placed behind the back. There has also been a wealth of glowing testimonies. “It’s not a medical device and it doesn’t claim to be,” says Sine. But she’s fascinated by health issues such as the link between snoring, sleep apnoea and its under-diagnosis in women. Studies have shown that men are twice as likely to get referred for sleep studies than women, and that sleep apnoea is undiagnosed in more than 90pc of women suffering from it. Read More Snooze reset: How to fall back to sleep after waking in the wee small hours Losing sleep – insomnia epidemic being driven by pandemic Women are more likely to report symptoms of poor sleep relating to sleep apnoea, such as daytime fatigue, headaches and depression, and be treated for those issues rather than what could be at the root of them, with one reason being the social stigma that persists around women snoring. “To me that’s another driving force into why I’m so interested in focusing on women and improving women’s sleep,” says Sine. “I think for women especially, poor sleep is often seen as something you just have to get through and the problems with sleep aren’t always instantly linked to sleep.” When Siest Sleep launched in January this year, the initial €30,000 investment came from personal equity and Kickstarter. Those involved in the Kickstarter fundraiser have also helped to provide product feedback which, alongside Sine’s own experience, her engagement with sleep consultants and information garnered from medical journals, informs the design process. But, with a background in strategy, operations and sales, Sine is keen to put more evidence-based research behind her product. She’s currently working on an innovation study with Trinity College’s Centre for Health Services, looking at weighted products and children with additional sensory need. “I love data so I’m taking feedback I’ve got from customers and putting more rigour behind it,” says Sine. The links between mental health problems and poor sleep are increasingly being investigated, with research now suggesting it might be a case of causation rather than correlation between the two. In 2017, the Get Better Sleep study at the University of Oxford concluded that how well we sleep may play a role in our mental health. According to the lead author, Daniel Freeman, professor of clinical psychology: “If you can sort out your sleep, you also could be taking a significant step forward in tackling a wide range of psychological and emotional problems.” It’s a link that Sine feels passionately about and 10pc of the profits from Siest sales are pledged to mental health charities. She’s aware that some people might baulk at the price of her pillows, €179 for the 1.5kg Lollypop length and €219 for the longer Wishbone shape weighing 2.5kg. “But if you buy two silk pillow cases that’s the same price and what you’re getting with a sleeper is a product that actually helps you sleep,” she explains. It’s also a product handmade in Ireland, predominantly with sustainable products, with free shipping and a 30-day trial. It might look like just a pretty pillow but there’s more to it than that, says Sine. “That’s the exciting thing about innovation,” she says. “It’s usually something that everyone goes, ‘why didn’t that exist before?’ and that’s why it’s proving to be so popular.” For information check out siestsleep.com Read More Expert tips and tricks to get a great night's sleep",https://www.independent.ie/life/health-wellbeing/health-features/ba974/40975996.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/st_Sine%20Dunne%20Beach,independent
How to support a person with dementia as lockdowns ease,https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-10-person-dementia-lockdowns-ease.html,['Health'],,,"Lockdowns lasting months in some states have seen tight restrictions on visitors to nursing homes. So as lockdowns ease, and if you're vaccinated, you might be planning a happy reunion with your friend or family.",,2021-10-25 13:42:05,"Lockdowns lasting months in some states have seen tight restrictions on visitors to nursing homes. So as lockdowns ease, and if you're vaccinated, you might be planning a happy reunion with your friend or family. If your loved one has dementia , you might be wondering if their symptoms have worsened in lockdown , or if they remember who you are. Here's what to look out for on your first visit after lockdowns end, and how to support your loved one after that. Expect some decline Lockdowns can result in decline in people with dementia, particularly those living in nursing homes. Research from lockdowns in 2020 showed people with dementia had more trouble thinking and problem solving. Their behavior and mood worsened. Some studies showed people were less able to do things around the home or look after themselves. Keeping mentally, physically and socially active helps people with dementia maintain their brain and thinking. But in lockdown, when people with dementia did less, they exercised their brains and bodies less. Lockdowns not only meant a ban on visitors to nursing homes, but limited stimulation from group activities, such as concerts, visits from schools and bus outings. During lockdowns, nursing home residents ( more than half have dementia) also got worse in terms of their thinking and well-being . Residents sometimes didn't understand why they couldn't move freely around the nursing home, and why their loved ones had stopped visiting. This led to increases in behaviors, such as agitation. After lockdowns began, there has been an increase in prescriptions of psychotropic medications reported internationally. These medications are used in nursing homes to manage behaviors such as aggression and agitation. The first visit can be difficult Some families might be worried about their first visit in several months to a person living with dementia. They might be concerned their loved one has gotten worse, or scared they won't recognize them. But it may help to think of visits as providing really important mental stimulation and human connection for your loved one, even though visits might be difficult emotionally for you. Introduce yourself: ""Hi Dad, it's Ali,"" if it looks like your loved one can't quite place who you are or your name. Read their reactions to you. If they need time to warm up to you (which might be disappointing if you are close), chat with someone else who is there. The person might enjoy your company even if they aren't actively participating in the conversation at first. Then invite them to participate in the conversation by asking them their opinion: ""How is the dog going?"" or ""I'm looking forward to going to the hairdresser, how about you?"". Prepare an activity to do together based on their interests. You could walk in the garden, browse a magazine about the royal family , sing along to a favorite album. If it's a noisy gathering, find a quiet spot for one-on-one conversation, as the person may have trouble focusing when there are several people talking at once. Let them know when you'll be back Because of your long separation, your loved one might be quite emotional or clingy when you are leaving. Let them know when you'll be coming again. You can write this down in their calendar, or on a card to give them. You can also tell the nursing home staff so they can remind them. You can also leave a visual reminder of your visit. This could be a card or photograph, or some flowers with a note. If possible, get back into a visiting routine. If you notice a decline Families are more likely to notice small or marked changes in their loved one's abilities if they have not seen them for several months. That might mean noticing early signs of dementia or worsening symptoms if they've already been diagnosed with it. So this can be a delicate conversation to have with your loved one. Many people can be defensive or in denial about changes, put it down to ""old age,"" and are afraid about having dementia. You might need to have the conversation several times to get them to see the doctor. Call the National Dementia Helpline on 1800 100 500 for advice. In the longer term, consider rehab Rehabilitation helps people with dementia. So it's worth looking into what support services your loved one might need. A psychologist can help with strategies to manage memory and thinking ; an occupational therapist can help with doing day-to-day things around the house ; an exercise physiologist or physiotherapist can help with mobility; and a speech pathologist can help with communication . Family carers can talk to their loved one's dementia specialist, or ask their GP for a Chronic Disease Management Plan for some subsidized rehabilitation sessions. If you're not the main carer If you're not the main family carer, make sure that person has some support. Ask how they are feeling and what support you can offer. Carers have been providing more help during lockdowns to people with dementia living in the community. That's because there have been fewer services on offer, and as people with dementia needed help to comply with restrictions. Offer to spend some time with the person with dementia so the carer can have a break. Or take the carer out for a meal and some social time now restrictions have eased.

Invested in collaborative study to enable expanded Breast Cancer risk testing for populations of African American descent addressing underlying and underserved need to include diverse population studies within risk testing protocols and applications Published peer-reviewed paper titled “Ability of known colorectal cancer susceptibility SNPs to predict colorectal cancer risk: A cohort study within the UK Biobank” Gafni A, Dite GS, Spaeth Tuff E, Allman R, Hopper JL (2021) on PLoS Strong cash balance of A$15.7 million providing 24 months of runway post the integration and revenue contribution from EasyDNA Net cash used for operations of A$1.9 million, due mainly to the increase in R&D and operating expenses as the Company executes on its commercialisation strategy Genetic Technologies is in a strong position with a portfolio of high-quality products in the market and under development and a substantial international platform for the distribution of the Direct-to-Consumer product base via EasyDNA. Over the quarter, the Company has continued to invest in its product development through the self-funded study in collaboration with the Institute of Public Health in St Louis, and continued progress with the Multi-Test with the post period end completion of the validation pack which has been submitted to NATA for approval. This is one of the final steps prior to commercial release of the test. Commenting on the quarter, CEO Simon Morriss stated: “This past quarter demonstrates the forward trajectory and momentum Genetic Technologies has established. We have built our product roadmap and our deliverables and are now positioned to execute on driving sales and product awareness in the months and years ahead. With the acquisition of EasyDNA we can fast track consumer awareness of our product portfolio with the ability to include consumer-initiated testing products on these platforms, subject to local jurisdictions restrictions and requirements. “We continue to innovate and have engaged with a number of notable institutions over the quarter which will pay rewards in the coming periods as we nurture these initiatives and relationships. Additionally, we are pleased to report the delivery of our preliminary revenue generation from the acquisition of EasyDNA contributing A$850k in customer receipts for the quarter. Alongside the established relationship with IBX we are confident that we are well resourced and appropriately positioned to drive forward with our objectives. We continue to demonstrate our transition from a pure R&D company to execute on commercialisation and deliver revenue growth in the coming periods.” Commercialization and Product Overview The Company’s strategy to commence commercialization and enhance the distribution network is well underway. Key avenues for commercialization of launched products currently include the consumer-initiated testing and online sales and marketing platform (CIT) available in Australia and the US. With the recent inclusion of the EasyDNA business the Company intends to leverage this platform to enhance the visibility and awareness of its existing products. Additionally, GENE are engaging in sales via medical professionals for business-to-business (B2B) purposes and direct-to-consumer (DTC) testing requiring no medical supervision for products under consideration including non-medical based genetic and gut microbiome testing, subject to regulatory approval and target market assessment. GENE now have distribution coverage of the Australian and US geographies and have identified Europe and the UK as the next regions the Company intends to enter. The Company is assessing the European CE certification requirements for its products and will update the market on its progress within these regions as further clarity on timing is obtained. An Asian market entry for relevant products will also be assessed in due course. The core products for release include GENE’s geneType for Breast Cancer, geneType for Colorectal Cancer and the COVID-19 Risk Test. The release of the Company’s Multi-Test to cover both Colorectal Cancer and Breast Cancer in addition to Prostate Cancer, Ovarian Cancer, Coronary Artery Disease and Type 2 Diabetes as part of the first phase is on track for release later this calendar year. The three-year co-exclusive licence agreement between IBX and GENE was announced on March 3, 2021 for the production, distribution, sales and marketing of GENE’s COVID-19 Risk Test in the US continues with further discussions underway. This includes discussions on opportunities to expand the products offered and consideration of further geographical opportunities given IBXs extensive network. Research and Publications The Company is pleased to report a further peer-reviewed research publication entitled “Ability of known colorectal cancer susceptibility SNPs to predict colorectal cancer risk: A cohort study within the UK Biobank” Gafni A, Dite GS, Spaeth Tuff E, Allman R, Hopper JL (2021) was published on PLoS. The study describes how the addition of a polygenic risk score to a family history model improves the stratification and discriminatory performance of 10-year and full lifetime risk using a prospective population-based cohort within the UK Biobank. Current screening guidelines in the UK, USA and Australia focus solely on family history and age for risk prediction, even though the vast majority of the population do not have any family history. The results support the view that a combined polygenic risk score and first-degree family history model could be used to improve risk stratified population screening programs. Additionally, GENE have committed to fund a collaborative study with Professor Graham Colditz, Deputy Director of the Institute for Public Health, Washington University in St. Louis. The purpose of the study is to incorporate further research and data on women of African descent to provide expanded testing capabilities for the geneType for Breast Cancer product. Polygenic risk models are required to be validated for use with multiple ethnicities and therefore GENE will be validating samples which have both genotype information and the relevant clinical information to cover this expanded population. This investment will be self-funded by GENE with costs estimated to be A$110k which will be partially offset by an R&D tax rebate estimated to be 43.5% of the costs associated with the study. The initial sample set will contain ~1,000 samples and it is anticipated to require around nine months of research and processing at GENE’s Melbourne laboratory. Professor Colditz is a world-renowned figure in breast cancer epidemiology and risk modelling, with notable genotype datasets on the African American population held by the Institute for Public Health. Given the multi-ethnic landscape (particularly in the USA) in which risk models may be used in clinical practice, it is important to understand how the risk model performs in these populations. The lifetime probability of developing non-hereditary breast cancer is 11.5% (1 in 9) for the African American population in the USA 1 . The Company remains committed to investing in product development and enhancement through continued research and validation through peer-reviewed publications. GENE continues to advance its strategic objective to provide the most comprehensive preventative risk tests for common complex disease. Outlook Commenting on the outlook, Simon Morriss stated: “In one quarter we have transformed the business and are positioned to drive significant revenue growth in the coming months and years. We are only at the beginning of this journey and have the right team, platform and resources to execute on our growth plans. “The challenging operating environment in Australia is coming to a close and we are grateful to be able to start operating on a more wholistic basis and invest in our marketing and sales initiatives globally. We are well placed to relaunch the geneType branding globally ahead of more normal trading conditions allowing us to accelerate our commercialisation plans.” We expect revenue growth in the December 2021 quarter will continue to show a material uplift with the Company scheduled to commercially release its Multi-Test at the end of the calendar year.

He was 59. Tyler's manager said he died peacefully at home in Los Angeles Sunday morning. ""If you met him once you made a friend for life,"" his manager said. He is survived by his wife Jennifer Carno, whom he married in 2017. Tyler was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer in September 2018, he revealed this summer. He said doctors discovered it during a routine physical when he was 56. Tyler was best known for the role of Gunther, the Central Perk barista who had an unrequited crush on Jennifer Aniston's Rachel Greene. But his career also included appearances on other sitcoms, such as ""Just Shoot Me!"" ""Sabrina, the Teenage Witch,"" and ""Scrubs,"" and he even played himself once on ""Episodes"" with Matt LeBlanc. Most recently, he released a spoken-word performance of the poem which was adapted into a short video to raise awareness for the Prostate Cancer Foundation. Donations to the Prostate Cancer Foundation in Tyler's name Last month, Tyler made an appearance via Zoom on the ""Friends: The Reunion"" special. The special, which aired on HBO Max, saw the main cast -- Courteney Cox, David Schwimmer, Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, and Matthew Perry -- revisit some of the biggest on-screen moments and discuss their memories of the show. Asked whether the ""Friends"" cast already knew about his illness, Tyler said the show's producers had been aware ""for a long time"" and that Schwimmer had corresponded with him on Instagram. According to the Mayo Clinic, prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer and the second-biggest cause of cancer death for men in the United States. While some types of prostate cancer grow slowly and may need minimal or even no treatment, others are aggressive and can spread quickly. During an interview with the ""Today"" show this summer, Tyler fought back tears as he said earlier detection is key and that he regretted not listening to ""my wonderful wife."" Tyler urged viewers to ""ask your doctor for a PSA (prostate-specific antigen) test"" next time they go in for an examination or check-up, adding that ""caught early (it is) 99% treatable.""",,abc30

Win McNamee/Getty Images hide caption A nurse draw a Moderna COVID-19 vaccine dose from a vial at the Cameron Grove Community Center in Bowie, Md., in late March. Moderna says study data supports use of a half-dose of the vaccine in children 6 to 11. Moderna says a study in kids 6 to 11 found two doses of the company's COVID-19 vaccine given 28 days apart produced a strong antibody response. The study, conducted in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health, used shots containing a 50 microgram dose of the vaccine, half the dose of the Moderna shots authorized for adults. More than 4,700 children ages 5 to 11 took part in the study. The most common side effects were fatigue, headache, fever and pain at the site of injection. The company says the analysis showed a ""favorable safety profile."" The summary of the study results was made available in a press release . The information hasn't been peer reviewed or published, but Moderna said it plans to submit them to a scientific journal for publication. The company also said it plans to submit the data to regulators, a move that would support the authorization of the vaccine for kids 6 to 11. The release of the data comes a day before a panel of advisers to the Food and Drug Administration will review use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in children 5 to 11 years of age. In June, Moderna submitted study results involving nearly 2,500 adolescents ages 12 to 15 to the FDA. The agency hasn't yet issued a decision on whether to expand use of the Moderna vaccine to that age group. In May, the FDA expanded authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to include adolescents 12 to 15 years of age.",,npr

How did California go from COVID-19 epicenter to lowest statewide transmission rate?,https://abc13.com/california-covid-19-infection-rate-vaccination-requirements-vaccine-mandates/11165638/,"['california covid-19', 'infection rate', 'vaccination requirements', 'vaccine mandates', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'CDC', 'moderate rate', 'substantial rate', '']",['ABCNews'],https://vcl.abcotv.net/video/wpvi/102521-wpvi-covid-vaccine-GMA-vid.mp4,"""We can't know for sure which factors are responsible,"" an epidemiologist said, ""but we know that the combination of interventions and policies can play a really strong role in driving transmission.""",,2021-10-25 12:21:01,"LOS ANGELES -- With the lowest COVID-19 infection rate among all states as of Friday, California, which has some of the strictest mask and vaccination mandates in the country, has managed to flip the script as the former U.S. epicenter of the pandemic. ""They've been very much forward-thinking in terms of policies around vaccination requirements and mandates,"" said epidemiologist Dr. John Brownstein, chief innovation officer at Boston Children's Hospital and an ABC News contributor. As of Friday evening, California had an infection rate of 61.1 cases per 100,000 over the past week, according to from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The state was briefly the only to be classified with a ""moderate"" rate of transmission -- 10 to 49.99 cases per 100,000 over seven days -- before it went back up to ""substantial,"" meaning 50 to 99.99 cases per 100,000 over seven days. Over the previous week, Hawaii, Florida, Louisiana, Connecticut, New Jersey, Mississippi, Maryland, Georgia and Washington, D.C., each also reported ""substantial"" rates. A rate of at least 100 cases per 100,000 is labeled as ""high."" Montana, Wyoming, Idaho and Alaska, as of Friday, had the highest rates over the previous seven days, with each above 450 cases per 100,000 people. The U.S. over that span was 150.9. Experts said California's journey from worst to is likely due to a combination of things. ""We can't know for sure which factors are responsible,"" Brownstein added, ""but we know that the combination of interventions and policies can play a really strong role in driving transmission."" More than 70% of California's population has received at least one dose of vaccine, , and the state also leads in total vaccinations administered, roughly 53 million doses. As of Friday, the national average rate was 66.2%. Being the first state to announce a COVID-19 vaccine requirement for schools, California has some of the strictest mandates in the U.S. The state has mandated vaccines for state employees, health care workers, teachers and at large indoor gatherings. ""The more aggressive the vaccination campaign, the better,"" Dr. Todd Ellerin, director of infectious diseases at South Shore Health, told ABC News. Given that vaccines are the most powerful tool we have in curbing the spread of COVID-19, experts said they believe California's emphasis on immunizations has provided big dividends. ""These results show quite clearly that vaccines offer protection for individuals who lack immunity, with important implications for finally ending this pandemic,"" Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, wrote in a Tuesday. Idaho and Wyoming have some of the lowest vaccination rates and the highest transmission rates. All three COVID-19 vaccines available in the U.S. have since shown high effectiveness in preventing death due to COVID-19, and as of Friday, California the lowest death rate in the country, with 0.3 per 100,000 over the previous week. The U.S. average over that span was 2.7 per 100,000. Additionally, experts told ABC News, having endured the harshest waves of infections last winter and the delta surge in July, formerly infected Californians may have acquired antibodies and more of a natural immunity to COVID-19 -- both factors that, in concert with vaccines, could be driving down case numbers. In addition to strict vaccine mandates, California has been unwavering on face-coverings, testing and social distancing policies. ""While California has administered more vaccines than any other state, we have more work to do,"" the California Department of Public Health said in a statement to ABC News. Everyone, regardless of vaccination status, is to wear a mask on public transit, in health care settings and at educational and correctional facilities. Masks are required for all unvaccinated people and recommended for vaccinated people in settings such as theaters, retail stores, restaurants and bars. Despite having a higher vaccination rate than California, states like Vermont are still falling behind on transmission rate rankings, which experts said points to the importance of distancing and masking. Breakthrough cases seen in Vermont can be further explained by its higher proportion of residents 65 and older. shows mobility, or movement in populations, can be a predictor of disease spread, especially via air travel or mass transit. This became evident through the surge of COVID-19 cases the U.S. saw during holiday season. Gov. Gavin Newsom with California residents on Christmas Eve to avoid holiday gatherings at a time when hospitals in the state were under ""unprecedented pressure."" Californian cities a huge surge of cases and hospitalizations following the holidays, although rates have since declined. No stranger to stay-at-home orders, the California government imposed several lockdowns and restrictions to curb the spread of the virus. It celebrated its most recent reopening in mid-June, which replaced 15-month-long public health restrictions with conditions more akin to ""business as usual."" ""In the height of the pandemic, people were locked down, they weren't moving at all, they were staying at home,"" Brownstein told ABC News. ""The more people move around, that's usually an indicator for increased transmission."" The virus has been shown to spread more indoors and with people in close proximity to one another. California's sunny climate means more people spend more time outside. ""When we spend most of our time indoors, that's when transmission is greatest,"" Ellerin said. Added Brownstein: ""More close contacts with people outside your household indoors is what creates additional risk."" This effect is also compounded by the rise in the virus' effective reproductive number during the winter season with research that a drop in temperature encourages virus growth. Compared to many other states, especially as winter draws nearer, California is in ""quite a good spot,"" Brownstein said. ""In all likelihood, the trends that we're seeing are realistic and very much driven by compliance with masking and other interventions, plus the well-covered vaccination strategy in the state.""",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/11165668_102521califmasks.jpg,abc13

Drs. Cynthia Hawkins and Roman Melnyk will receive the funds for their ground-breaking attempt to target high-grade gliomas (HGG). HGGs are aggressive and incurable brain cancers, such as glioblastoma, with an almost 100% fatality rate and no effective treatment. The funds were made available thanks to the generous support from sponsors, including Scotia Wealth Management, Yamana Gold, and Hampton Securities. Drs. Hawkins and Melnyk are developing a potential therapeutic approach that targets the RAS pathway. RAS can become dysregulated, causing cell growth and cell survival of HGGs. Their research aims to create a protein chimera called RRSP-DT that can address all the diverse ways RAS becomes dysregulated, bringing it back to a normal state. The therapy, if successful, could benefit patients diagnosed with pediatric or adult HGGs. ""This funding will allow us to follow up on our exciting early studies suggesting the protein chimera developed in Dr. Melnyk’s lab may be a promising new therapeutic approach to treat high grade gliomas,"" said Dr. Hawkins, neuropathologist and Senior Scientist, Cell Biology at The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) in Toronto. High-grade gliomas are a group that includes various brain cancers, which are particularly aggressive. The estimated two-year survival rate is 20%, despite the current standard of care that includes surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. In addition, these diseases deteriorate the quality of life for patients as they progress. However, research into treatments and technologies to combat these types of cancers is tragically underfunded. Less than 3% of all governmental cancer funding is devoted to brain cancer research. ""We remain strongly committed to supporting the fight against high-grade gliomas by funding research, treatment and technology,"" said Brain Cancer Canada chair Angela Scalisi. ""Our volunteer-based organization has already been able to give full funds to two Canadian research projects this year. We are so proud to support these brilliant scientists who endeavour each day to fight what is without a doubt one of the most lethal diseases we face"" . ""We know the best therapy we have to fight HGGs is still ineffective for the far majority of the patient population,"" said Marc Peeters, Director Partnerships and Stakeholders at Brain Cancer Canada. ""This research opens up new avenues to find better therapies, which both child and adult patients need. We are incredibly grateful to our donors, and we urge our governments to join us in funding research that is in an early stage but promising enough to warrant investment. We need to make bigger bets to achieve life-changing results for those patients who need it so much. It has been 15 years since the last therapy breakthrough, and patients cannot afford another decade-and-a-half of waiting"" .

(NASDAQ: AQST), a pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing differentiated products that address patients’ unmet needs and solve therapeutic problems, today announced positive topline data from its first-in-human Phase 1 PK study of AQST-109 sublingual film for the delivery of epinephrine in the emergency treatment of allergic reactions including anaphylaxis. Findings from this study support AQST-109’s potential as the first orally administered epinephrine treatment for anaphylaxis, with safety, tolerability, PK and pharmacodynamics (PD) measures that fall within the target range of standard of care autoinjectors such as epinephrine pens which require patients or caregivers to inject into their thighs during an emergency allergic reaction. “These findings represent a critical step forward in the development of our product candidate AQST-109 as the first oral product aiming to treat anaphylaxis,” said Keith Kendall, Chief Executive Officer of Aquestive. “The optimized PK/PD profile of our epinephrine prodrug demonstrates that our oral alternative to epinephrine injection can, in fact, match the PK parameters of autoinjectors while lowering barriers to use and improving convenience, ultimately resulting in better, often life-saving outcomes for patients. Based on our review of published literature, AQST-109 is the only non-injection form of epinephrine to achieve a median Tmax of 15 minutes or less. We are encouraged by these findings and continue to believe patients will embrace this needle-free, user-friendly alternative.” AQST-109 is a polymer matrix-based film that can be applied sublingually (under the tongue) for the rapid delivery of epinephrine. The product is similar in size to a postage stamp and begins to dissolve on contact. No water or swallowing is required for administration. The packaging for AQST-109 is thinner and smaller than an average credit card, can be carried in a pocket, and is designed to withstand weather excursions such as exposure to rain and/or sunlight. Current stability data is tracking favorably to support a two-year shelf life. The Phase 1 randomized, single-ascending dose (SAD) study was performed with AQST-109 in order to assess safety, tolerability, PK, and PD profiles. The study was conducted in Canada pursuant to a clinical trial application approved by Health Canada. Subjects participating in the trial received, in ascending fashion, sublingually administered doses of AQST-109 across four different formulations. The four formulation compositions were varied to assess critical absorption factors including drug loading and the use of inventive excipients designed to influence absorption, stability, and the conversion of the prodrug. A target formulation (“formulation #2” highlighted below) was designed as the lead candidate for the study. Study Highlights Key clinical measures for comparability to existing autoinjectors (C max , T max , and area under the curve, or AUC) were within expected ranges for formulations 1, 2 (target), and 4 Observed PD values were comparable to existing data for autoinjectors AQST-109 was generally well tolerated with no serious adverse events Study Results AQST-109 (epinephrine prodrug sublingual film) 12 mg Comparable Data from Previous & Published Studies Film Formulation # 1 2 (Target) 3 4 EpiPen® 1 EpiPen® 2 Auvi-Q® 1 Dosings (n) 6 8 6 7 135 10 67 C max (pg/mL) 552 762 164 307 518 341 484 AUC 0-t (hr*pg/mL) 634 603 329 303 560 328 526 Median T max (minutes) 15 15 20 10 10 22 20 T max range (minutes) 15-25 10-35 20-50 5-50 4-60 5-90 5-60 This study indicated that AQST-109 was absorbed and rapidly converted to epinephrine with an observed median T max of 15 minutes and an observed geometric mean C max of 762 pg/mL for the target formulation. The findings for the target formulation are comparable to published study results for both EpiPen and Auvi-Q 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 . In addition, the target formulation had similar median T max values at lower dose strengths (15 minutes and 17.5 minutes for the 6 mg and 9 mg doses, respectively, included in the study). Based on the study results, Aquestive plans on continuing development of the target formulation to take forward into a pivotal PK study. Safety data indicated that AQST-109 was generally well tolerated with no serious adverse events (SAE’s), significant medical events, or treatment-related severe adverse events reported within the trial. All treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) deemed at least possibly related were mild to moderate in nature across cohorts. The PD markers measured changes from baseline in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure. The changes observed suggest a comparable effect for AQST-109 when compared to autoinjectors in healthy volunteers. David Fleischer, MD, Section Head, Pediatric Allergy and Immunology at Children’s Hospital Colorado, Professor of Pediatrics at University of Colorado School of Medicine, commented, ""An epinephrine delivery solution such as AQST-109 for cases of severe life-threatening allergic reactions could address the most important factor contributing to anaphylaxis fatality: the therapeutic time window. The needle-free, pocket-sized, and temperature safe attributes of this first-of-its-kind orally administered prodrug will make it the preferred choice for parents of children facing these risks.” Aquestive has submitted its request for a pre-investigational new drug (IND) meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and anticipates receiving a written response from the FDA before the end of the year. In parallel, Aquestive is on track to conduct a crossover study using an adaptive design for AQST-109 in Canada beginning in the fourth quarter 2021. It is anticipated that this study will establish a final formulation and dose strength for commercial scale-up. The study will include comparisons to 0.3 mg and 0.5 mg epinephrine intramuscular (IM) manual injection and is anticipated to complete in the first half of 2022. A presentation of the results of the Phase 1 PK study of AQST-109 is available on the events and presentation of the investor section of the Company’s website at https://investors.aquestive.com/events-and-presentations# and has been filed with the SEC on Form 8-K. About Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening systemic allergic reaction, with an estimated incidence of 50 to 112 episodes per 100,000 people per year. The frequency of hospital admissions for anaphylaxis has increased 500-700% in the last 10-15 years. The most common causes of reactions that can include anaphylaxis are medications, foods (such as peanuts), and venom from insect stings. Epinephrine injection is the current standard of treatment intended to reverse the potentially severe manifestation of anaphylaxis, which may include red rash, throat swelling, respiratory problems, gastrointestinal distress and loss of consciousness. About AQST-109 Aquestive Therapeutics is developing a sublingual (SL) film containing a prodrug of epinephrine as an alternative dosage form to epinephrine injection (1 mg/mL). The targeted indication for epinephrine prodrug sublingual film is the same as that for epinephrine injection in the emergency treatment of Type 1 allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Aquestive’s SL film contains a prodrug of epinephrine incorporated into a polymer-based film matrix utilizing its innovative PharmFilm® technology. Prodrugs are generally not active moieties and require biotransformation to the parent compound in vivo to allow for therapeutic activity. Treatment with AQST-109 has been generally well-tolerated, with treatment-emergent adverse events observed thus far being mild to moderate in severity. There have been no serious adverse events observed. About Aquestive Therapeutics Aquestive Therapeutics is a pharmaceutical company that applies innovative technology to solve therapeutic problems and improve medicines for patients. The Company has commercialized one internally-developed proprietary product to date, Sympazan® (clobazam) oral film, has a commercial proprietary product pipeline focused on the treatment of diseases of the central nervous system, or CNS, and other unmet needs, and is developing orally administered complex molecules to provide alternatives to invasively administered standard of care therapies.

Guillain-Barré syndrome is a rare, autoimmune disorder in which a person’s own immune system damages the nerves, causing muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis. GBS can cause symptoms that last for a few weeks to several years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most patients with GBS recover fully, but some have permanent nerve damage. Yahoo News reports that the syndrome was added to the list of potential side effects from the AstraZeneca jab by the European Medicines Agency last month, and now the MHRA has also added it to its list after a review of available data. According to the UK government, GBS is a very rare side effect of the COVID-19 vaccine, noting that it may affect up to one in 10,000 people. “According to reports, a government document revealed that up to 13 October, the MHRA had received 432 reports of the syndrome with the AstraZeneca COVID vaccine, 59 following use of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and four reports connected to the Moderna vaccine. “Health officials maintain that vaccinations are the best way to combat COVID-19, with the government urging anyone who hasn’t had a jab to get one,” Yahoo News reports. Recently, the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency said it recorded 191 serious and 6,555 non-serious adverse effects since the commencement of COVID-19 vaccination. The Executive Director of the Agency, Faisal Shuaib said this at a briefing in Abuja.

The experts said it has become necessary to discourage cultures prohibiting the consumption of snails and okro by breastfeeding mothers, stressing that there is no scientific evidence to back the claim that the nutritious foods make babies drool saliva or cause other health issues. According to the experts, the nutritional value and composition of breast milk are regulated by the nutritional status of the mother. One of the experts, and a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Paediatrics, College of Medicine, University of Lagos, Dr. Beatrice Ezenwa, told PUNCH HealthWise in an exclusive interview that breastfeeding mothers need to eat a nutritious and well-balanced diet. Dr. Ezenwa who is also a Consultant Neonatologist/ Paediatrician with the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Idi-Araba said nursing mothers should eat in moderation and avoid what they noticed consistently do not agree with their babies or themselves. The neonatologist said, “In general, a breastfeeding mother can eat any food. No food is off-limit because a woman is breastfeeding. “The key point is to eat a balanced diet and eat in moderation. Having said that, each baby is different and may react differently to certain foods eaten by the mother which comes out in the breast milk in terms of nutrients and flavor. “Some babies can be very fussy and cranky when their mothers eat very spicy foods. Other babies become sleepy or have disorganised sleep patterns when their mothers consume too much of certain other foods such as alcohol and caffeine. “In some cultures in Nigeria, breastfeeding mothers are prohibited from eating certain nutritious foods such as snails, okro, etc because it will make the baby drool saliva. “Meanwhile others encourage the consumption of more harmful ones such as excessive alcohol intake like palm wine in the name of helping the breast milk to flow. These myths are unfounded and the practices are not good, so should be discouraged,” she added. On the myths about certain foods that mothers consume during breastfeeding that make their babies have constipation, the paediatrician said it is not common for exclusively breastfeeding infants to be constipated. Dr. Ezenwa explained, “Breast milk is considered a natural laxative because of the easily digestible nutrients it contains. “There are many other reasons a baby may be gassy that have nothing to do with the foods the mother has eaten. “Some people believe falsely that eating hot and spicy foods or acidic foods such as citrus fruit and tomatoes may cause ‘gassiness’ in babies, but these are not proven. “Unless you can see a direct relationship between specific foods and the same reaction in the baby every time, there is no need to limit your diet.” The child health expert further stated that it is untrue that consuming egusi soup, fruits, and vegetables during breastfeeding makes babies prone to stooling. According to her, this is not proven, saying, “I can safely say, it is not true.” She, however, said, “A breastfed baby may have an allergy or sensitivity reaction after the mother consumes certain foods or drinks (for example cow’s milk allergy, wheat, corn, eggs, nuts, and fish). “This does not mean that every baby whose mother consumed these foods will have diarrhoea. “People react differently to things. If a breastfeeding baby consistently has diarrhea each time a mother consumes a certain food he should be taken to a hospital for proper evaluation.” The neonatologist advised breastfeeding mothers to eat a well-balanced diet. “Eat in moderation and avoid what you notice consistently do not agree with your baby or yourself. “You also need to eat all types of food common in your culture or environment to help your child develop the taste bud for that food. “Some flavors infants are exposed to through breast milk can influence their food preferences as they grow up,” she said. Also speaking with our correspondent, Assistant Chief Dietician, Ajeromi General Hospital, Ajegunle, Lagos, Olusola Malomo, said, “Cultural beliefs and practices can markedly influence a woman’s pregnancy and childbirth experiences, and may shape a woman’s mothering behaviour. “Dietary intake before and during pregnancy and throughout the lactation period is often influenced by cultural beliefs and practices,” Malomo said. Speaking on some foods that are avoided by pregnant women on the ground of cultural beliefs, the dietician said, “In a recent scientific study, approximately 37 per cent of respondents avoided some foods in pregnancy due to food taboos. “Snail and grasscutter meat were the commonly avoided foods in pregnancy, while eggs were commonly withheld from children under two years old. “Some respondents believed that eating snail and grasscutter meat makes a child sluggish and labour difficult respectively; while some say that starting egg early for a child could predispose them to steal later in life.” Charting the way forward, the dietician called for women’s empowerment and education.

Nearly 200,000 new prostate cancer cases are diagnosed each year in the US with over 1 million biopsies being performed. CLS’s goal is to enable high precision, focal laser ablation of prostate cancer tumors to be performed under local anesthetic in an office setting or clinic as well as hospitals. In June 2021, CLS announced that Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg, Medical faculty in Germany will be evaluating the use of TRANBERG Thermal Therapy system with MRI-US, fusion-guided focal laser ablation therapy in early stage prostate cancer in a 10-patient clinical trial. See published clinical studies . “CLS’s TRANBERG Thermal Therapy System has successfully performed MRI-guided, focal laser ablation treatments for hundreds of patients suffering from early stage prostate cancer,” stated Dan Mogren, acting CEO for CLS. “Recent development improvements of MRI-Ultrasound, fusion-guidance systems have enabled both diagnostic biopsy and other ablation procedures, such as cryoablation, to be effectively performed within a doctor’s office setting. We believe our laser ablation system will function very well and produce excellent results as a focal therapy using the same fused image guidance technology.” The safety and diagnostic accuracy of MRI-US, fusion-guided prostate biopsies is well documented with strong global market growth each year. The workflow for focal laser ablation of prostate tumors is very similar to the one used for biopsy and can potentially be performed also as a follow-on outpatient procedure. High precision, image-guided focal laser ablation performed using the TRANBERG Thermal Therapy System is safe and offers a focal therapy option for treatment of prostate tumors while minimizing side effects and maintaining the patient’s quality of life. High Precision Thermal Therapy System The TRANBERG® |Thermal Therapy System has been developed for image-guided, high-precision soft tissue thermal therapy and ablation procedures. For the US market, the system is configured for CT or MRI-US, fusion image-guided procedures, and can be configured for tissue temperature feedback for precise temperature and ablation control. It includes a desk-top mobile laser unit, innovative non-cooled laser applicators, external tissue temperature probe sensors, and procedure specific accessories. Its non-cooled, laser fiber technology optimizes heat distribution, eliminates the need for external cooling, and helps reduce procedure times. About Clinical Laserthermia Systems Clinical Laserthermia Systems AB (publ) develops and sells the TRANBERG® Thermal Therapy System , including sterile disposables, for minimally invasive treatment of cancer tumors and drug-resistant epilepsy, according to regulatory approvals in the EU and the US. The products are marketed for image-guided laser ablation and for treatment with imILT®, the Company's interstitial laser thermotherapy with potential immunostimulatory effects.

(www.i3biomedical.com) achieves the fastest and most efficient “killing speed” of SARS-CoV-2. TrioMed sets the unequalled standard of superiority in Active protection worldwide. The Virucidal technology developed by i3 BioMedical Inc. was confirmed to deactivate more than 99.9% of SARS-CoV-2 – the virus that causes COVID-19 – on the outer surface of the TrioMed Active Medical products (including mask) in 5 minutes after 8 hours of simulated usage, according to independent virology tests conducted at the University of Toronto. Scientists, led by Professor Scott Gray-Owen of the Department of Molecular Genetics at U of T’s Temerty Faculty of Medicine, used the Faculty’s high-tech containment level three (CL3) lab to test the efficacy of the protective layer of TrioMed Active Medical products. “Our tests confirmed that the TrioMed Active technology deactivates more than 99.9% of SARS-CoV-2 at the fastest current testing time point of 5 minutes when applying the virus after 8 hours of mask use,” says Gray-Owen, who has no affiliation with the company or its employees. “The TrioMed Active material was submitted to an exceptionally demanding protocol for a period of 8 hours at our laboratories representing extreme usage condition for facemask, gowns and similar medical products, prior to being sent to the University,” said Mohammed Belhaj, president of Atlas Pharma inc. (Health Canada registration #102041-A) “For over a decade, the TrioMed Technology has provided the highest level of protection against numerous micro-organisms to users worldwide. For medical antimicrobial products, the parameter of 'speed to kill' is critical to provide true protection: 'killing speed' of 30 minutes to hours does not protect sufficiently the wearer, it means that viruses remain infectious for that entire period of time. Only an antimicrobial 'speed to kill' of maximum 5 min provides a REAL & TRUE protection,” said Pierre Jean Messier, Executive Chairman of i3 BioMedical Inc. TrioMed Active products have been systematically in use and tested against numerous pathogenic bacteria and viruses over the course of 10+ years with the consistent results of killing (deactivating) more than 99.9% in 5 min of all the tested microbes.

(NASDAQ: ATRS) (the “Company”), a specialty pharmaceutical company, today announced that an abstract on XYOSTED ® , a subcutaneous testosterone enanthate injection, was accepted as on oral presentation at the 22 nd Annual Fall Scientific Meeting of SMSNA in Scottsdale, AZ on October 21-24, 2021. The abstract entitled “ Subcutaneous Testosterone Enanthate and the Effect of Body Mass Index on Serum Testosterone in Men with Testosterone Deficiency ” was presented by Martin M. Miner, MD, Men’s Health Center, Miriam Hospital, Providence, RI. The post-hoc analysis evaluated the association between body mass index (“BMI”) and serum total testosterone to assess the pharmacokinetics parameters of XYOSTED ® , a weekly subcutaneous testosterone enanthate treatment, in men with testosterone deficiency and varying BMIs. Dr. Miner concluded that patients with higher BMI may require higher testosterone doses to return serum testosterone to physiological levels. Dr. Peter Richardson, EVP, Research and Development and Chief Medical Officer of Antares Pharma, commented, “We appreciated the opportunity to highlight analysis of our clinical trial data on XYOSTED at this year’s congress. We believe the multiple dosage strengths (50 mg, 75 mg, 100mg) of XYOSTED can allow patients to be titrated to their optimal dose. As always, we value our engagement with healthcare providers who are committed to patient care.” About SMSNA The Sexual Medicine Society of North America’s objective is to promote, encourage, and support the highest standards of practice, research, education, and ethics in the study of human sexual function and dysfunction.

About Antares Pharma Antares Pharma, Inc. is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused primarily on the development and commercialization of self-administered injectable pharmaceutical products using advanced drug delivery auto injector technology. The Company has a portfolio of proprietary and partnered commercial products with several product candidates in various stages of development, as well as significant strategic alliances with industry leading pharmaceutical companies including Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd. (Teva), AMAG Pharmaceuticals (AMAG), Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) and Idorsia Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Idorsia). Antares Pharma’s FDA-approved products include XYOSTED ® (testosterone enanthate) injection, OTREXUP ® (methotrexate) injection for subcutaneous use and Sumatriptan Injection USP, which is distributed by Teva. The Company also markets NOCDURNA ® (desmopressin acetate) in the U.S. and expects to commercially launch TLANDO ® (testosterone undecanoate) in the U.S. pending final FDA approval. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION WARNING: BLOOD PRESSURE INCREASES XYOSTED ® can cause blood pressure (BP) increases that can increase the risk for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke and cardiovascular death, with greater risk for MACE in patients with cardiovascular risk factors or established cardiovascular disease. Before initiating XYOSTED ® , consider the patient’s baseline cardiovascular risk and ensure blood pressure is adequately controlled. Starting approximately 6 weeks after initiating therapy, periodically monitor for and treat new onset hypertension or exacerbations of pre-existing hypertension in patients on XYOSTED ® . Re-evaluate whether the benefits of XYOSTED ® outweigh its risks in patients who develop cardiovascular risk factors or cardiovascular disease while on treatment. Due to this risk, use XYOSTED ® only for the treatment of men with hypogonadal conditions associated with structural or genetic etiologies. XYOSTED ® INDICATIONS AND USAGE XYOSTED ® (testosterone enanthate) injection is an androgen indicated for testosterone replacement therapy in adult males for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone. Limitations of Use: Safety and efficacy of XYOSTED ® in males less than 18 years old have not been established. XYOSTED ® CONTRAINDICATIONS Men with carcinoma of the breast or known or suspected carcinoma of the prostate. Women who are pregnant. Testosterone may cause fetal harm. Known hypersensitivity to XYOSTED ® or its ingredients. Men with hypogonadal conditions not associated with structural or genetic etiologies. XYOSTED ® WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Monitor hematocrit approximately every 3 months to detect increased red blood cell mass and polycythemia. Monitor patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) for worsening signs and symptoms of BPH. Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) have been reported in patients using testosterone products. Evaluate patients with signs or symptoms consistent with DVT or PE. Testosterone has been subject to abuse, typically at doses higher than recommended for the approved indication and in combination with other anabolic androgenic steroids. Exogenous administration of androgens may lead to azoospermia. Edema with or without congestive heart failure may be a complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. Sleep apnea may occur in those with risk factors. Monitor prostatic specific antigen (PSA) and lipid concentrations periodically. Depression and suicidal ideation and behavior, including completed suicide, have occurred during clinical trials in patients treated with XYOSTED ® . ADVERSE REACTIONS The most commonly reported adverse reactions (>5%) were: hematocrit increased, hypertension, PSA increased, injection site bruising, and headache.

He was 59. Tyler's manager said he died peacefully at home in Los Angeles Sunday morning. ""If you met him once you made a friend for life,"" his manager said. He is survived by his wife Jennifer Carno, whom he married in 2017. Tyler was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer in September 2018, he revealed this summer. He said doctors discovered it during a routine physical when he was 56. Tyler was best known for the role of Gunther, the Central Perk barista who had an unrequited crush on Jennifer Aniston's Rachel Greene. Warner Bros. Television mourns the loss of James Michael Tyler, a beloved actor and integral part of our FRIENDS family. Our thoughts are with his family, friends, colleagues and fans. ❤️☕️ pic.twitter.com/9coGnT5BHz — FRIENDS (@FriendsTV) October 24, 2021 But his career also included appearances on other sitcoms, such as ""Just Shoot Me!"" ""Sabrina, the Teenage Witch,"" and ""Scrubs,"" and he even played himself once on ""Episodes"" with Matt LeBlanc. Most recently, he released a spoken-word performance of the poem ""If You Knew,"" which was adapted into a short video to raise awareness for the Prostate Cancer Foundation. Donations to the Prostate Cancer Foundation in Tyler's name may be made here. Last month, Tyler made an appearance via Zoom on the ""Friends: The Reunion"" special. The special, which aired on HBO Max, saw the main cast -- Courteney Cox, David Schwimmer, Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, and Matthew Perry -- revisit some of the biggest on-screen moments and discuss their memories of the show. Asked whether the ""Friends"" cast already knew about his illness, Tyler said the show's producers had been aware ""for a long time"" and that Schwimmer had corresponded with him on Instagram. According to the Mayo Clinic, prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer and the second-biggest cause of cancer death for men in the United States. While some types of prostate cancer grow slowly and may need minimal or even no treatment, others are aggressive and can spread quickly. During an interview with the ""Today"" show this summer, Tyler fought back tears as he said earlier detection is key and that he regretted not listening to ""my wonderful wife."" Tyler urged viewers to ""ask your doctor for a PSA (prostate-specific antigen) test"" next time they go in for an examination or check-up, adding that ""caught early (it is) 99% treatable.""

Study finds 'robust' evidence that Covid-19 is seasonal infection,https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/health/study-finds-robust-evidence-that-covid-19-is-seasonal-infection-329928,,,,"London, October 26 Covid-19 may be a seasonal infection linked to low temperatures and humidity, much like seasonal influenza, according to new ""robust"" evidence found by researchers. The study, recently published in the journal Nature Computational Science, also supports the considerable contribution of airborne SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the need to shift to measures that promote ""air hygiene."" A research team led by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal), Spain, noted that a key question regarding SARS-CoV-2 is whether it is behaving, or will behave, as a seasonal virus like influenza, or whether it will be equally transmitted during any time of the year. A first theoretical modelling study suggested that climate was not a driver in Covid-19 transmission, given the high number of susceptible individuals with no immunity to the virus. However, some observations suggested that the initial propagation of Covid-19 in China occurred in a latitude between 30 and 50 degrees N, with low humidity levels and low temperatures between 5 degrees and 11 degrees Celsius. ""The question of whether Covid-19 is a genuine seasonal disease becomes increasingly central, with implications for determining effective intervention measures,"" said Xavier Rodo, director of the Climate and Health programme at ISGlobal and coordinator of the study. The researchers first analysed the association of temperature and humidity in the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 spread in 162 countries across five continents, before changes in human behaviour and public health policies were put into place. The results show a negative relationship between the transmission rate (R0) and both temperature and humidity at the global scale, the researchers said. Higher transmission rates were associated with lower temperatures and humidity, they said. The researchers then analysed how this association between climate and disease evolved over time, and whether it was consistent at different geographical scales. They used a statistical method that was specifically developed to identify similar patterns of variation at different windows of time. The team found a strong negative association for short time windows between the number of cases and temperature and humidity. The patterns were consistent during the first, second and third waves of the pandemic at different spatial scales: worldwide, countries, down to individual regions within highly affected countries and even to the city level. The first epidemic waves waned as temperature and humidity rose, and the second wave rose as temperatures and humidity fell, according to the researchers. However, this pattern was broken during summertime in all continents, they said. ""This could be explained by several factors, including mass gatherings of young people, tourism, and air conditioning, among others,"" said Alejandro Fontal, researcher at ISGlobal and first author of the study. When adapting the model to analyse transient correlations at all scales in countries in the Southern Hemisphere, where the virus arrived later, the same negative correlation was observed. The climate effects were most evident at temperatures between 12 degrees and 18 degrees Celsius and humidity levels between 4 and 12 grammes per cubic metre (g/m3). However, the study authors warned that these ranges are still indicative, given the short records available. Using an epidemiological model, the researcher showed that incorporating temperature into the transmission rate works better for predicting the rise and fall of the different waves, particularly the first and third ones in Europe. ""Altogether, our findings support the view of Covid-19 as a true seasonal low-temperature infection, similar to influenza and to the more benign circulating coronaviruses,"" Rodo said. This seasonality could contribute importantly to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, since low humidity conditions have been shown to reduce the size of aerosols, and thereby increase airborne transmission of seasonal viruses such as influenza. ""This link warrants an emphasis on 'air hygiene' through improved indoor ventilation as aerosols are capable to persist suspended for longer times,"" said Rodo. The study highlights the need to include meteorological parameters in the evaluation and planning of control measures.

(Nasdaq: DICE), a biopharmaceutical company leveraging its proprietary technology platform to build a pipeline of novel oral therapeutic candidates to treat chronic diseases in immunology and other therapeutic areas, today announced that the first healthy volunteer has been dosed in the Company’s Phase 1 clinical trial of S011806. S011806 is an orally-available, small molecule antagonist of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-17 (IL-17), which is a validated drug target for the treatment of a variety of immunological diseases. The Phase 1 trial of S011806 is designed to generate safety and pharmacokinetic data, as well as provide early clinical proof-of-concept in psoriasis patients. “S011806 is designed to be a highly selective and potent orally administered inhibitor of the IL-17 cytokine, a well-validated target in psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondylarthritis,” said Kevin Judice, Ph.D., founder and CEO of DICE Therapeutics. “The initiation of this clinical trial for S011806, the first of several programs in our IL-17 franchise, marks a major milestone in our mission to bring an effective and convenient oral therapy to patients suffering from IL-17 mediated diseases like psoriasis.” The Phase 1 clinical trial is a first-in-human, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that will evaluate S011806 in healthy volunteers and psoriasis patients in the UK. The trial will evaluate single and multiple ascending doses in healthy volunteers to understand the safety and pharmacokinetics of S011806. In addition, the Phase 1 clinical trial will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and efficacy of S011806 across two dose regimens in psoriasis patients, which could provide early clinical proof-of-concept and dose selection guidance for use in future studies. About S011806 and Psoriasis S011806 is an orally available, small molecule antagonist of the pro-inflammatory signaling molecule IL-17, an immune cell-derived cytokine that is produced in response to infection by certain microorganisms. Upon binding to its receptor on various cell types found in tissues (e.g. keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells), IL-17 elicits downstream signals that orchestrate sustained tissue inflammation, with the aim of clearing the invading pathogen. In autoimmune diseases, the immune system appears to over-react and mount strong immune responses in the absence of an obvious infectious event. Over the past two decades, research has shown that IL-17 is a powerful driver of psoriasis, a skin disease that occurs in the absence of an obvious infectious event. Psoriasis manifests as erythematous plaques with thick scaling that can occur anywhere on the body. Symptoms include itching, bleeding, and pain; furthermore, the disease can lead to disfiguration and considerable psychological burden. According to the National Psoriasis Association, more than eight million Americans – and 125 million people worldwide – suffered from psoriasis in 2020. There is no cure for psoriasis. S011806 is being developed initially for the treatment of psoriasis, with the objective of achieving therapeutic benefit similar to that of the U.S. FDA-approved injectable biologics. About DICE Therapeutics, Inc. DICE Therapeutics, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company leveraging its proprietary technology platform to build a pipeline of novel oral therapeutic candidates to treat chronic diseases in immunology and other therapeutic areas. DICE is initially focused on developing oral therapeutics against well-validated targets in immunology, with the goal of achieving comparable potency to their systemic biologic counterparts, which have demonstrated the greatest therapeutic benefit to date in these disease areas. The Company’s DELSCAPE platform is designed to discover selective oral small molecules with the potential to modulate protein-protein interactions (PPIs) as effectively as systemic biologics. DICE’s lead therapeutic candidate, S011806, is an oral antagonist of the pro-inflammatory signaling molecule, IL-17, which is a validated drug target implicated in a variety of immunology indications. DICE is also developing oral therapeutic candidates targeting α4ß7 integrin and αVß1/αVß6 integrin for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, respectively.

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared that by 2050, the number of people living with disabling hearing loss will reach over 900 million. Apart from that, physiological aging of the ear, genetic susceptibility, higher noise exposure, vascular disorder, and chronic inflammation would also contribute to the surging demand for these aids. However, the social stigma associated with hearing loss and devices often results in patients missing their check-ups. It may hamper growth. Hearing Devices Segment to Lead Stoked by Rising Usage of Behind-the-ear Devices Based on product, the hearing devices segment is set to hold the largest hearing aids market share and lead in the coming years. This growth is attributable to the rising usage of behind-the-ear devices as they resemble Bluetooth earphones. Also, invisible-in-the-canal and completely in the canal devices are nowadays experiencing high demand because of their ability to provide more confidence in people. Increasing Development of Novel Devices to Spur Growth in Europe In 2020, North America procured USD 2.48 billion in terms of revenue. The increasing adoption of less noticeable devices to surge the aesthetic appeal would aid growth. Europe is projected to witness lucrative growth throughout the forthcoming years on account of the rising research and development activities to create advanced hearing aids. In Asia Pacific, the increasing old age population is expected to drive growth. Have Any Query?

Moderna says its low-dose COVID vaccine works for kids 6 to 11,https://6abc.com/moderna-vaccine-for-kids-who-has-near-me-costco-booster-covid/11166164/,,['AP'],,"Moderna said half-dose shots induced strong levels of virus-fighting antibodies in youngsters, with temporary side effects such as fever and fatigue.",,2021-10-25 16:10:58,"Moderna said Monday that a low dose of its COVID-19 vaccine is safe and appears to work in 6- to 11-year-olds, as the manufacturer moves toward expanding shots to children. Competitor Pfizer's kid-sized vaccine doses are closer to widespread use, undergoing evaluation by the Food and Drug Administration for nearly the same age group - starting at age 5. Its vaccine already is authorized for anyone 12 or older. Moderna hasn't yet gotten the nod to offer its vaccine to teens but is studying lower doses in younger children while it waits. Researchers tested two shots for the 6- to 11-year-olds, given a month apart, that each contained half the dose given to adults. Preliminary results showed vaccinated kids developed virus-fighting antibodies similar to levels that young adults produce after full-strength shots, Moderna said in a press release. EMBED > More News Videos Vaccines for children will ""very likely"" be available in early November, Dr. Anthony Fauci told ""This Week"" anchor George Stephanopoulos. The study included 4,753 kids ages 6 to 11, who got either the vaccine or dummy shots. Moderna said that like adults, the vaccinated youngsters had temporary side effects including fatigue, headache, fever and injection site pain. The study was too small to spot any extremely rare side effects, such as heart inflammation that sometimes occurs after either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines, mostly among young men. Moderna said it plans to submit its pediatric data to the FDA and global regulators soon. The FDA hasn't yet ruled on the company's application to expand its vaccinations to 12- to 17-year-olds, although some countries have cleared Moderna's shots for adolescents. But the U.S. is expected to begin vaccinating kids under 12 sometime next month, if the FDA clears small doses of the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine for 5- to 11-year-olds. Pfizer reported last week that its kid-sized doses proved nearly 91% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 in the younger age group, even as the extra-contagious delta variant was spreading widely. FDA's advisers will deliberate Pfizer's evidence in a public meeting Tuesday. If the agency authorizes Pfizer's kid shots, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the following week is set to recommend who should receive them. Report a correction or typo",,6abc
Quitting at younger age cuts most smoking-associated cancer mortality risk,https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-10-younger-age-smoking-associated-cancer-mortality.html,['Health'],,,"(HealthDay)—Starting to smoke at any age is associated with an increased cancer mortality rate, while quitting, especially at younger ages, can avert most of this risk, according to a research letter published online Oct. 21 in JAMA Oncology.",,2021-10-25 15:54:14,"(HealthDay)—Starting to smoke at any age is associated with an increased cancer mortality rate, while quitting, especially at younger ages, can avert most of this risk, according to a research letter published online Oct. 21 in JAMA Oncology . Blake Thomson, D.Phil., from the American Cancer Society in Atlanta, and colleagues conducted a prospective cohort study to examine the correlation between age at smoking initiation and cessation and cancer mortality at ages 25 to 79 years. The researchers found 10,014 cancer deaths at ages 25 to 79 years among 410,231 participants with 3.7 million person-years of follow-up. The overall cancer mortality rate ratio associated with current smoking was 3.00 compared with never smokers. The rate ratios were 4.01, 3.57, 3.15, 2.86, and 2.44 for those starting at ages younger than 10, 10 to 14, 15 to 17, 18 to 20, and 21 years or older, respectively. If these excesses were interpreted as mainly causal, smoking would account for 75 and 59 percent of cancer deaths among those starting at younger than 10 years and at age 21 years or older, respectively. Compared with never smokers, the rate ratios were 0.95, 1.23, 1.45, and 1.88 for quitting at ages 15 to 34, 35 to 44, 45 to 54, and 55 to 64 years, respectively, resulting in avoiding an estimated 100, 89, 78, and 56 percent of the excess cancer mortality risk seen in association with continued smoking.

Staffer calls Mayo Clinic 'communist' for vaccine rule and resigns her job,https://www.inforum.com/newsmd/health-news/7253387-Staffer-calls-Mayo-Clinic-communist-for-vaccine-rule-and-resigns-her-job,,,,"Kalley Newkirk, a 25-year-old pregnant woman who has worked at Mayo Clinic for four years, opposes the requirement for employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Currently on administrative leave, she wrote a very critical letter of resignation, spurring a right wing talk show host to bring her on his online show.",,2021-10-25 18:33:17,"ROCHESTER -- Mayo Clinic administrative assistant Kalley Newkirk opposes the mandate for all non-exempt employees to receive COVID-19 vaccinations to the point that she resigned from her position and described the clinic’s policy as “communist” in an interview on an online conservative talk show. Newkirk, a 25-year-old pregnant woman who has worked at Mayo Clinic for four years, believes one shot of the Pfzier vaccine in January caused her to not be able to sleep or eat for days and led her to be hospitalized in a locked mood disorder ward in the Generose Building for 10 days. One month after her discharge from the hospital, she had a miscarriage, followed by a second miscarriage a month later. Her doctors and medical team said there was no medical connection between the vaccine and her disorders or miscarriages, and at least three medical studies seeking a correlation between the vaccines and miscarriages have not established any connection. Newkirk's care team strongly urged her to get the second Pfizer shot, but she fervently believes the vaccine was the source of her problems as she is very sensitive to medicine. Acknowledging that she has no medical education, Newkirk said her opinion was “based on how I had been in the period from when I left the hospital to when those events (miscarriages) happened… it just all correlated so much. I think you'd have to be there in person to further understand.” She also cites the “research” of Dr. Robert Malone, a virologist who speaks out against the COVID-19 vaccines. Her unsubstantiated belief that the vaccine caused her health problems caused her distress, especially when Mayo Clinic sent out a message earlier this month that non-exempt employees would be terminated in January if they were not vaccinated. “I was devastated. I sobbed pretty much the rest of the day,” Newkirk said of getting the email on Oct. 13 about the vaccine requirement. “I knew that I needed to think about what I was doing with my career choices and what the next steps of my life were going to be, because of the baby on the way.” She had an interview for a promotion at Mayo Clinic scheduled, but she canceled it because of the vaccination rule. A few days after she sent her resignation letter, Newkirk sent a longer letter to Mayo Clinic CEO Dr. Gianrico Farrugia and other Mayo Clinic leaders to tell them of her decision. “I am NOT an anti-vaxxer. I have every other vaccine under the sun! I believe in science, I believe in research, but what I don’t believe in: politics getting involved in personal health choices,” she wrote. “This institution is falling victim to communism. The Mayo brothers believed that politics was to STAY OUT of Mayo Clinic; we were always told to remain neutral. Now, we are folding to communist executive orders and not standing up with our own voice and research.” She cited the Mayo Clinic’s references to a federal vaccine mandate from the Biden administration as evidence that the clinic’s decision to have employees get the shot is political versus medical. In addition to supporting the “communist” political agenda, Newkirk also said that Mayo Clinic’s true reason to back this is financial. “They do get money from the government for Medicare and Medicaid. And that I'm sure that is the reason that they did this mandate, honestly. That's what I think… I do believe this whole thing is about money,” she said. In a statement Monday, Mayo said ""making COVID-19 vaccination a requirement to work at Mayo Clinic will help ensure we have a healthy workforce and that Mayo Clinic is a safe place to receive care — just as our patients expect. In consideration of the safety of our patients, staff, visitors and communities, Mayo Clinic is transitioning to the next phase of its COVID-19 vaccination program, with vaccination required to continue to work at Mayo Clinic. A review process will be available for staff to seek medical or religious exemptions to vaccination. Staff may participate in social media and advocacy on their own behalf, in accordance with applicable Mayo Clinic policies."" Newkirk posted her letter on her Facebook page and to a private online Mayo Clinic employee group of about 1,100 people who oppose the vaccine rule. The group enthusiastically supported her statements. Some of them passed her letter on to online talk show host Stew Peters. Peters, who calls himself ""The Bullhorn of the People,"" asked Newkirk to be on his program. Peters, who claims that the FDA has not approved any COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S., introduced the interview by commenting on statements Mayo Clinic doctors have made on social media criticizing people who oppose vaccinations. He said Mayo Clinic has ""annihilated their credibility in their response to this pandemic."" “Not everyone at Mayo Clinic is bad, "" he said introducing Newkirk as a brave woman opposing the clinic's mandate. Newkirk, wearing her Mayo Clinic employee badge, told Peters her story. The interview was posted on Oct. 22. The next day, Newkirk said she was placed on administrative leave by Mayo Clinic. On Monday, Mayo said she was still employed there. After writing the letter, appearing in the Peters’ show, what does Newkirk hope Mayo Clinic will do? She believes Mayo Clinic has the power to stand up to the federal government and defy any vaccine orders, if the leadership would “speak up” and support its employees who don’t want to be vaccinated.",https://www.postbulletin.com/incoming/7252636-e4utgj-newkirkonpetersshow.jpg/alternates/BASE_LANDSCAPE/newkirkonpetersshow.jpg,inforum

The company also provided a clinical data update from the on-going Phase 1/2 clinical trial of 4D-110 in patients with choroideremia. “Today we announced the first ever clinical data reported with an intravenous product invented from our Therapeutic Vector Evolution platform at 4DMT. These interim data demonstrate clinical proof-of-concept for tolerability and clinical activity,” said David Kirn, M.D., Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of 4DMT. “These data support our belief that 4D-310 is well-tolerated, and has the potential to deliver patient benefit after a single intravenous injection. Importantly, the post-treatment AGA enzyme activity in patients’ blood was within, or significantly above, the normal range despite the presence of pre-existing anti-AGA antibodies, which are a result of prior ERT in these patients. To our knowledge, these initial clinical data are the first demonstration of durable serum AGA activity within the normal and above normal range following gene therapy in a difficult to treat classic Fabry disease patient population.” “We designed 4D-310 for a unique dual mechanism of action, enabling the potential treatment of target tissues such as heart, blood vessel walls and kidney through cross-correction from high and stable serum AGA activity, as well as through direct transduction and AGA expression in target cells,” said Dr. Raphael Schiffmann, M.D., Senior Vice President & Clinical Therapeutic Area Head, Lysosomal Storage Diseases and Cardiology. “This dual MOA opens the potential to effectively treat the broadest possible range of Fabry patient populations. Given the encouraging initial clinical activity and tolerability profile of 4D-310, we plan to continue enrolling a broad patient population, including both anti-AGA antibody positive and negative patients, as well as classic and late-onset patients.” “Fabry disease is a severe lysosomal storage disease with high unmet medical need despite ERT with an invasive biweekly infusion regimen,” said Dr. Jerry Vockley, M.D., PhD, Chief of Genetic and Genomic Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and a principal investigator on the 4D-310 Phase 1/2 trial. “These interim clinical data suggest that 4D-310 is well-tolerated and has the potential to effectively treat a broad range of patients with Fabry disease.” 4D-310 for Fabry Disease Interim Clinical Data Summary The data described are from the ongoing Phase 1/2 dose-escalation and dose-expansion clinical trial assessing intravenous 4D-310, 4DMT’s targeted and evolved C102 vector-based product candidate designed for a broad Fabry disease patient population. The primary endpoint of the trial is safety and tolerability. Key secondary endpoints include change from baseline in serum AGA activity and serum lyso-Gb3. The data cutoff date was October 12, 2021. As of the data cut-off date, three patients with Fabry disease were enrolled, with post-treatment follow-up ranging from six weeks to six months. These patients were enrolled in the 1E13 vg/kg cohort, the lower of two planned dose escalation cohorts: 1E13 vg/kg and 3E13 vg/kg. Prior to dose-escalation, the trial is designed to allow enrollment of an additional 6 patients in the 1E13 vg/kg dose cohort. An oral corticosteroid prophylaxis taper was administered over 10 weeks post-dosing. Key Baseline Characteristics All three patients currently enrolled are patients with classic Fabry disease, defined as having AGA activity <5% of mean normal in peripheral blood white cells and having one or more clinical characteristics such as acroparesthesia, hypohidrosis, angiokeratoma or cornea verticillata. Consistent with the classic Fabry disease phenotype, all three patients had serum AGA activity below mean normal at baseline, ranging from 0 – 0.42 nmol/hr/mL (population normal range: 4.44 – 27.42 nmol/hr/mL; population mean normal 9.9 nmol/hr/mL). All three patients had prior experience on enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Patients 1 & 3 were enrolled while receiving ERT (ON-ERT). Patient 2 had prior experience with ERT but was not receiving ERT (OFF-ERT) for ~13 months prior to dosing. Consistent with prior ERT use, each patient had positive baseline anti-AGA antibody titers: Patient 1: Baseline anti-AGA antibody titer 1:947 Patient 2: Baseline anti-AGA antibody titer 1:99,900 Patient 3: Baseline anti-AGA antibody titer 1:13,900 4D-310 Preliminary Clinical Activity Summary Following 4D-310 infusion, mean serum AGA enzyme activity was within, or significantly above, the normal range in all three patients, despite pre-treatment anti-AGA antibody titer positivity in all patients. Lyso-Gb3 substrate concentrations in serum decreased significantly in Patient 2, who enrolled in the trial OFF-ERT and therefore with an elevated lyso-Gb3 level. Lyso-Gb3 substrate concentrations in serum remained low and stable in Patients 1 and 3 following discontinuation of ERT. Patients 1 & 3: Baseline: Both patients were receiving ERT and at baseline had low-lyso-Gb3 and positive pre-treatment anti-AGA antibody titers (1:947 – 13,900, respectively). AGA Enzyme Activity: Both patients demonstrated an increase in serum AGA enzyme activity significantly above the normal range at all timepoints through last follow-up. Mean post-treatment serum AGA enzyme activity in patients 1 & 3 were well above the normal range at 2,506% (25-fold) and 2,114% (21-fold) mean normal (248.1 and 209.3 nmol/hr/mL, respectively). Lyso-Gb3: Patient 1 serum lyso-Gb3 remained low and stable through week 26 and after ERT discontinuation at week 14. Patient 3 serum lyso-Gb3 remained low and stable through week 6 and following ERT discontinuation at week 2. Patient 2: Baseline: Patient 2 entered the trial OFF-ERT but had prior ERT treatment that was stopped ~13 months prior to dosing. As a result, Patient 2 had a high baseline lyso-Gb3 level (101 ng/mL). Patient 2 also had the highest pre-treatment anti-AGA antibody titer of all three patients treated and of all patients screened (1:99,900). AGA Enzyme Activity: Patient 2 demonstrated a significant increase in serum AGA enzyme activity into the normal range. Mean serum AGA enzyme activity increased to 58% of mean normal (5.7 nmol/hr/mL). Lyso-Gb3: Lyso-Gb3 decreased significantly (>50%) within the first four weeks and remained stable through week 12. 4D-310 Interim Safety Data Summary 4D-310 demonstrated a manageable safety profile in all three patients. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. No serious adverse events were reported with Patient 1 and 3, and these patients did not have either atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) or liver toxicity, which are the 2 primary class-related toxicities associated with systemically administered AAV. Patient 2 developed transient, self-limited aHUS within approximately one week following treatment and was admitted to the hospital for observation and hydration and was discharged after four days. As a result of hospitalization, this event was classified as a serious adverse event (SAE). The patient received no complement inhibitors; kidney function recovered without further intervention Laboratory parameters improved daily throughout this observation period, and no lasting clinical sequelae resulted. Transient and asymptomatic grade 1 (mild) transaminitis (AST/ALT) was also observed in this patient at a separate and single protocol-defined timepoint. No other SAEs were reported. 4D-110 for Choroideremia Clinical Data Update Summary 4D-110 is currently being studied in an ongoing Phase 1/2 dose escalation clinical trial in patients with choroideremia. To date, six patients with clinically advanced choroideremia have been enrolled. A standard 3+3 dose escalation design was used. Patients were enrolled in one of two dose cohorts: 3E11 vg/eye (cohort 1; n=3) and 1E12 vg/eye (cohort 2; n=3). To date, at the 3E11 vg/eye dose (Cohort 1), 4D-110 was well-tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities or serious adverse events. Initial signals of clinical activity were observed at this dose, through anatomical measurements of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) by fundus autofluorescence area and photoreceptors by ellipsoid zone area. We expect to continue enrolling at the 3E11 vg/eye dose level. At the 1E12 vg/eye dose, pigment dispersion (iris transillumination) was observed in three patients in the 1E12 vg/eye cohort ~7 to 9 months following treatment. Two cases were asymptomatic and one patient reported mild glare. In each case the investigator described this as an SAE but no hospitalization or medical intervention was initiated. We believe this pigment dispersion finding is consistent with REP1 transgene overexpression in iris pigment epithelial cells (IPE); no association with inflammation was evident.

About 4DMT 4DMT is a clinical-stage company harnessing the power of directed evolution for targeted gene therapies. 4DMT seeks to unlock the full potential of gene therapy using its platform, Therapeutic Vector Evolution, which combines the power of directed evolution with approximately one billion synthetic capsid sequences to invent evolved vectors for use in targeted gene therapy products. The company is initially focused in three therapeutic areas: ophthalmology, cardiology, and pulmonology. The 4DMT targeted and evolved vectors are invented with the goal of being delivered through clinically routine, well-tolerated and minimally invasive routes of administration, transducing diseased cells in target tissues efficiently, having reduced immunogenicity and, where relevant, having resistance to pre-existing antibodies. 4DMT is currently advancing five product candidates in clinical development: 4D-310 for Fabry disease, 4D-125 for XLRP, 4D-150 for wet AMD, 4D-710 for cystic fibrosis and 4D-110 for choroideremia. 4D Molecular Therapeutics™, 4DMT™, Therapeutic Vector Evolution™, and the 4DMT logo are trademarks of 4DMT. 4D-310, 4D-125 and 4D-110 are our product candidates in clinical trials and have not yet been approved for marketing by the US FDA or any other regulatory authority.

Quips about putting radio on the internet aside, the persistent popularity of podcasting and the cockamamie climb of Clubhouse shows that audio-based platforms will continue to echo around the upper echelons of the ecosystem for a while yet. Joining the fray is Heart to Heart, an audio-first dating app aiming to bring back some intimacy to the process of finding the right person for your next foray, whether that’s a saucy encounter or a mate for life. “I used to act, and from my time in acting, I saw how much voice, and audio experiences drive intimacy between people,” explains Joshua Ogundu, co-founder and CEO of Heart to Heart. “When it came down to the dating apps, it was never something I could get into. I felt like you needed to come up with a textual one-liner. That was never my way of approaching romantic conversations.” Heart to Heart is pushing back against the endless swiping and messaging of many of its competitors, offering a contrasting experience to sending the same opening line to dozens of people or typing with your thumbs until deep into the night. “I believe that the best consumer investments come from people who have unique insights on consumer behavior and ways that new tech products can allow new forms of social interaction,” said Charles Hudson from Precursor Ventures, who led the pre-seed investment round. “I have been a big fan of Josh’s TikTok videos for some time and his ability to poke at the tech industry with timely, relevant videos really showcased his creativity and ability to communicate via short-form video. I think the idea around confirming photos, storytelling, and audio will yield a product that really speaks to people’s unmet needs around communication and will create a whole new way for people to connect.” While Precursor doesn’t particularly focus on audio-first startups, the team has seen a number of opportunities in that space. It was an early investor in Howard Akumiah’s company, Betty Labs (acquired by Spotify), as well as Isa Watson’s company (Squad), Falon Fatemi’s company (Fireside) and several others that are still in stealth. “I believe that there is a major wave of interesting activity happening around non-music audio and I believe that we are still in the early innings of non-music, audio-driven social experiences,” says Hudson. “The last two companies that I feel really innovated in this category were Tinder and Bumble. I think Josh and his team have a new mechanic that feels differentiated and unique and I think it has the potential to be the foundation for a new way for people to meet and get to know each other in ways that aren’t easily accomplished today.” Joshua Ogundu, co-founder and CEO of Heart to Heart (Photo provided by Heart to Heart) The company raised the pre-seed round of $750,000. The round was led by Precursor Ventures, and Bryce Roberts of OATV & Angelica Nwandu of The Shade Room partnered on the investment, as well as Marie Rocha at Realist Ventures. In addition, a number of angel investors joined the round, including Chris Bennett (Wonderschool), Andy Weissman (USV) and Gregory Levey (Robinson Huntly). “The main thing we are trying to accomplish with the $750K, is to focus on building our iOS app, and making LA our first launch market,” says Ogundu. “Dating is such a local experience, and it makes sense to us to build and improve locally, then scaling it up from there.” “Voice is so intentional and intimate, and that is exactly what we’re building here at Heart to Heart,” says Ogundu, suggesting that the voice mechanic is helpful in a dating context because it helps slow people down. “I think that because it takes more energy to send that voice snippet to someone, you’ll be more intentional with who you even look to strike up conversations with.” The founding team consists of Joshua Ogundu, who wears the CEO hat. He is joined by Arihant Jain and Komal Shrivastava, who have been heading up the engineering and design efforts. The company hopes to get its product to market by the end of the year.",2021-10-25 18:30:46,,,techcrunch

Opinion: A lot of B.C. workers seem ready to get fired over COVID-19 vaccinations,https://www.nsnews.com/coronavirus-covid-19-local-news/opinion-a-lot-of-bc-workers-seem-ready-to-get-fired-over-covid-19-vaccinations-4548316,,['Keith Baldrey'],,It is puzzling why so many people with scientific training have refused the vaccine.,,2021-10-25 17:27:00,"There are more than 400,000 unvaccinated eligible people in B.C. and most of them are slowly discovering the consequences of their inaction when it comes to not being immunized from COVID-19. They cannot go to restaurants for a meal, travel by plane or train, or attend many sporting and cultural events. Many of them, however, are going to discover they face an even more serious consequence for refusing the vaccine: the loss of their jobs. Vaccination mandates are expanding in scope and number, and they will cover thousands of people. This week, more than 5,000 health-care workers were expected to be placed on unpaid leave because they have yet to receive a single dose of a COVID-19 vaccine by the Oct. 26 deadline. Already more than 1,700 long-term care staff – including almost 400 nurses – have been placed on leave because of their non-vaccinated status. It is puzzling why so many people with scientific training have refused the vaccine. In long-term care, the refusal rate is the same for both nurses and food service employees. To estimate how many other employees in other sectors with looming vaccination mandates may soon be out of a job, it is useful to look at the numbers in both the health-care sector and the long-term care sector. The vaccination rates among employees in both sectors is around 96% (although only 93% in the Interior). On the one hand, that is an impressively high figure but on the other, it also translates into literally thousands and thousands of unvaccinated staff potentially losing employment. For example, there are roughly 130,000 employees in B.C.’s health-care sector. This includes all medical staff, support staff and administration. So while an unvaccinated rate of just 4% seems small, when it is applied to such a large pool of people, it can produce a big number. Hence, the 5,000-plus health-care workers placed on unpaid leave. If that 4% unvaccinated rate turns out to be the average in other sectors, that works out to roughly 1,200 B.C. government employees losing their jobs on Nov. 22, when their mandate takes effect and about 240 Vancouver civic workers suffering the same fate on Dec. 6. Of course, these numbers will be much smaller if enough people covered by these mandates come to their senses and get a vaccine that has been proven safe and effective for billions of people around the world. In addition, it is reasonable to think that many unvaccinated people, when faced with the harsh reality that accompanies the loss of a paying job and financial benefits, will do just that. Perhaps the federal government’s announcement that these folks will not qualify for unemployment insurance will cause some to reconsider. We can only hope so. In the meantime, it will be interesting to see how many school districts impose their own vaccine mandates on teachers and other school workers. If the 4% average for unvaccinated staff that we’ve seen in health care is mirrored in the K-12 sector, hundreds of teachers could be added to the “on leave” crowd. The consequences for refusing the vaccine are getting harsher.

"More than 9 out of 10 workers comply with vaccine mandates, but some remain defiant",https://abc30.com/vaccine-mandate-covid-mandates-vaccines-biden/11162552/,,['AP'],,These defiant workers have the potential to create disruptions in a tight labor market.,,2021-10-24 15:07:05,"BATH, Maine -- Josh ""Chevy"" Chevalier is a third-generation shipbuilder who hasn't missed a day of work during the pandemic in his job as a welder constructing Navy warships on the Maine coast. But he's ready to walk away from his job because of an impending mandate from President Joe Biden that federal contractors and all U.S. businesses with 100 or more workers be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. ""People are fighting for their constitutional rights - the way they think their life should be,"" said Chevalier, one of hundreds of employees at Bath Iron Works threatening to leave. Chevalier is among a small but significant number of American workers deciding whether to quit their jobs and careers in defiance of what they consider intrusive edicts that affect their freedoms. The Biden administration, public health officials and many business leaders agree that , prudent actions necessary to help the world emerge from a pandemic that has killed more than 700,000 Americans and nearly 5 million people worldwide. The defiant workers make up a small fraction of the overall workforce, with many cities, states and businesses reporting that more than 9 out of 10 of their workers are complying with mandates. But they have the potential to create disruptions in a tight labor market and have become the latest roadblock in overcoming the vaccine hesitancy that allowed the COVID-19 crisis to take a devastating turn over the summer. In many cases, the reasons for the objections are rooted in misinformation. The refusers come from all types of occupations - defense industry workers, police officers, firefighters, educators and health care workers. In Seattle, a group of city firefighters turned in their boots at City Hall on Tuesday to protest a vaccination requirement. Thousands of people have sought religious or medical exemptions that were rejected; others won't stand to be told what to do and have quit or been fired. , the football coach at Washington State University, was let go from his $3.2 million-a-year job on Monday, along with four assistants. Rolovich, the first major college coach to lose his job over vaccination status, claimed a religious exemption but has declined to elaborate. He is suing. The conflict over mandates is likely to grow in the coming weeks. The Biden administration is expected to move forward any day with the mandate that employers with 100 or more workers require all employees be vaccinated or undergo weekly testing, though enforcement likely won't start for several weeks. The rule for federal contractors goes into effect in December, with no testing option, but many businesses, governments and schools are already implementing mandates. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other groups that represent large employers have warned workers might simply migrate to jobs at smaller businesses where they don't face vaccination requirements. That could create challenges for large retailers going into the holiday season, among other disruptions, the chamber warned. Individuals who've left their jobs and are seeking work that doesn't require vaccinations are sharing information on social media. Small employers looking for workers are turning to online job boards such as RedBalloon, where employers sign a pledge that they won't make vaccines a condition for hiring. Andrew Crapuchettes, RedBalloon's founder and chief executive, said he started the online job board more than two months ago for people ""who just want to work and don't want to get into politics in the office."" More than 800 companies have posted, and more than 250,000 people have visited the site, he said. Some states, , Montana and Florida, are gearing up to fight or undercut the Biden mandates. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued an executive order Monday barring any entity from requiring vaccines. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Thursday he will call a special session to pass legislation to combat vaccine mandates, saying that, ""in Florida, your right to earn a living is not contingent upon whatever choices you're making in terms of these injections."" Melissa Alfieri-Collins, a 44-year-old mother of two, said she resigned from her job as a nurse at Jersey Shore Medical Center in Neptune, New Jersey, rather than undergo regular COVID-19 testing. She said the hospital recognized her request for a medical exemption, but she objected to the requirement that only unvaccinated people get tested, arguing that even vaccinated people can spread disease. ""My family and I, we had a long talk, and I basically don't want to compromise my values any more,"" said Alfieri-Collins, who hopes to become a nurse practitioner and pursue her own holistic practice. ""I am very sad because I am the type of nurse that loves my patients and my patients love me,"" she said. Anthony Polenski, director of strategic partnerships for tech recruiting company Jobfuture.ai, said he's seeing candidates who want to know, ""Will this company force me to take a jab?"" Polenski said they are often leaving previous employers because of a vaccine mandate. ""They don't want their vaccination status attached to their employment,"" he said. At the shipyard in Maine, frustration is rising among union members. On Friday, some 100 shipbuilders gathered outside the shipyard during their lunch break to protest being forced to get vaccinated. They marched down the street, holding signs decrying the mandate and using choice four-letter words that made clear what they think of the president and his vaccine mandates. The union fears it could lose more than 1,000 workers, or 30% of its membership, over the federal contractor mandate. Dean Grazioso, a 33-year Bath Iron Works employee, said he's not anti-vaccine but that he knows vaccinated coworkers, friends and family members who've contracted breakthrough COVID-19 infections. Such infections are rare and vaccinated people who get COVID-19 usually have mild symptoms and are far less likely to be hospitalized or die. The 53-year-old is still deciding whether to get the shot. ""I'm still up in the air,"" he said. ""But I've got a huge decision to make."" ____",,abc30

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Ed Sheeran (@teddysphotos) Already Releases Songs The uptempo first single, “Bad Habits,” rode the top spot on the English singles charts for eleven weeks and peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 tally. It was accompanied by a high-gloss video in which Sheeran stars as a glam vampire. The dance pop tune “Shivers” entered at No. 1 on the UK charts, displacing “Habits” and topped-out at No. 10 on the Hot 100. He spends another late night looking for love in the special effects-heavy “Shivers” video, which finds Ed dressing up in an homage to pal Elton John’s feathery outfits and hanging out in a morgue with his beloved. YouTube Shorts Preview If you simply cannot wait to hear the album, Sheeran provided Sheerios with a first-of-its-kind preview of the album via a collab with YouTube on a series of 14 video shorts — one for each song on the album — which dropped on Monday morning (Oct. 25). The clips, which each run 20 seconds or less, cover a wide range of scenes, from Sheeran pounding the drums to the high-energy opening track “Tides,” to him stepping into a bathtub filled with ice while wearing a suit in the “Shivers” bit and smiling at a man dancing in a doorway with a giant bowl of chips for “Bad Habits.” Elsewhere, Sheeran and his wife Cherry lounge around, kiss and flirt in the affecting preview of the gentle acoustic ballad “First Times,” Ed busts out a spray can for some freestyle painting to the strains of the wistful acoustic pop gem “Overpass Graffiti” and he spotlights his cat’s adventures in the adorable “The Joker and the Queen” short for the hushed piano ballad. We also hear a bit of the yearning mid-tempo “Leave Your Life,” the remix-ready dance pop tracks “Collide,” “2Step” and “Stop the Rain,” as well as the sweeping acoustic jangle of “Love in Slow Motion,” the tear-stained acoustic homage to those we’ve lost, “Visiting Hours,” the bouncy lullaby “Sandman” and the bubbling, beat-driven album closer “Be Right Now.” {""nid"":""9650211"",""type"":""post"",""title"":""Ed Sheeran Tests Positive for COVID-19 Days Ahead of His New Album Release"",""relative_path"":""\/articles\/news\/9650211\/ed-sheeran-tests-positive-covid-19\/"",""media"":{""width"":1548,""height"":1024,""extension"":""jpg"",""mime_type"":""image\/jpeg"",""type"":""image"",""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/09\/ed-sheeran-2021-vma-billboard-1548-1631733909-compressed.jpg"",""sizes"":[{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/09\/ed-sheeran-2021-vma-billboard-1548-1631733909-compressed.jpg"",""width"":1548,""height"":1024},{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/09\/ed-sheeran-2021-vma-billboard-1548-1631733909-compressed.jpg"",""width"":1548,""height"":1024}],""orientation"":""landscape"",""id"":""9630573"",""caption"":null,""credit"":null}} Tour Dates Though he hasn’t yet unveiled his North American tour plans, Sheeran has dropped the dates for his upcoming 2022 UK/European stadium tour, which will include shows in Belfast, Manchester, London, Amsterdam, Paris, Copenhagen and Belfast.

It locked down thousands of people in the North.Top U.S. health officials signaled confidence that children ages 5 to 11 will begin getting Covid-19 vaccines by early November. The Pfizer vaccines will likely be given at pediatricians’ offices rather than at pharmacies or large sites.Singapore health officials deployed their fake-news law against the “Truth Warriors” website for making claims regarding vaccine effectiveness and ivermectin’s use as a treatment, among other things.Key Developments:Virus Tracker: Cases top 243.6 million; deaths surpass 4.9 millionVaccine Tracker: More than 6.86 billion shots givenResurgent Covid means it could be another tough winterDelta variant is bolstering the case for booster shots: QuickTakeSingapore Issues Fake-News Directive Against Website (10:03 a.m. HK)Singapore’s Ministry of Health has instructed the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (Pofma) Office to issue a Correction Direction to the “Truth Warriors” website for assertions related to the effectiveness of Covid vaccines, use of ivermectin as a treatment and more.Read more: Singapore Deploys its Fake News Law Against Anti-Vaxxer GroupJokowi Pushes for Southeast Asia Travel Arrangement (9:58 a.m. HK)Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo pushed for travel to reopen in Southeast Asia, saying this would help economic recovery in the region that has seen coronavirus cases recede.He said the Association of Southeast Asian Nations needs to hit its vaccination target of 70% of the population of over 650 million people as soon as possible so that economies could reopen safely.Jokowi, as the president’s known, has been pushing for a regional travel corridor arrangement since late last year.

The small county bordering Mongolia is the current outbreak’s hotspot, home to nearly one-third of the more than 150 infections found over the past week in the mainland.The lockdown came a day after a warning from National Health Commission officials that the outbreak would continue to worsen after spreading to 11 provinces in about a week. China reported 38 Covid infections on Monday, half of which were found in Inner Mongolia.Read more: China Locks Down Thousands in North as Delta Outbreak SpreadsSouth Korea to Start Return to ‘Normal Life’ (9:42 a.m. HK)South Korea will begin a “gradual return to normal life” in Nov. as 70% of the population has been fully vaccinated, President Moon Jae-in said at the National Assembly.

The encounter, earlier reported by Florida Politics, took place between Senator Tina Polsky and Joseph Ladapo, who met her in her office regarding his upcoming confirmation after being appointed by Governor Ron DeSantis. She has been diagnosed with breast cancer. “He’s very smug,” Polsky said. “And I told him several times, ‘I have this very serious medical condition.’ And he said, ‘That’s OK,’ like it basically has nothing to do with what we are talking about.’”Ladapo has questioned the vaccine’s efficacy and safety, and like DeSantis, opposes shot mandates. Florida was hit hard by the latest wave of the virus, accounting at one point for a fifth of U.S. cases. Pediatricians Should Vaccinate Kids, Gottlieb Says (1:09 p.m. NY)Children ages 5 to 11 should be vaccinated in their pediatrician’s offices, said Scott Gottlieb, former head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. He’s a board member of Pfizer Inc., whose vaccine is to be considered for authorization for young children. “Getting children vaccinated is a much more consultative endeavor,” Gottlieb said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “You don’t want children to have to go to mass vaccination sites or even necessarily a pharmacy. You want them to go into the comfort of their own pediatrician’s office.”He said the vaccine, developed with BioNTec SE, will be packaged for doctors’ offices.U.S. Kids Set for Shots by Early November (11:30 a.m. NY)Two top U.S. health officials signaled confidence that children ages 5 to 11 will begin getting Covid-19 vaccines by early November. “If all goes well, and we get the regulatory approval ... it’s entirely possible if not very likely that vaccines will be available for children from five to 11 within the first week or two of November,” Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, said on ABC’s “This Week.”His comments were echoed by Rochelle Walensky, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which must ultimately approve the shots. “There will be vaccine out there so children can start rolling up their sleeves,” Walensky said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”Health experts say vaccinating children will be a key step in helping end the U.S. outbreak, though a Kaiser Family Foundation study found in September that only about a third of parents would vaccinate their children immediately. Almost 65 million eligible Americans ages 12 and older are not vaccinated. Advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will meet Tuesday to consider data for children’s use of the vaccine by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE. Approval by the FDA and the CDC is also required.Sunak Plays Down New U.K. Curbs (6:18 a.m. NY)U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak told the BBC that available Covid-19 data don’t support a move to harsher restrictions. Speaking against a backdrop of rising virus cases and ahead of his budget this week, Sunak said a return to the furlough program that saw the government pay as much as 80% of the wages of idled workers was not on the cards. “We don’t envisage having to impose significant economic restrictions in the way that we had to over the last year.”Malaysia Sees Further Drop in Cases (4:49 p.m. HK)Malaysia recorded the fewest cases since the end of June. The Southeast Asian country added 5,666 new infections Sunday, bringing the total number of cases to more than 2.43 million, according to a tweet by Health Malaysia Director-General Noor Hisham Abdullah. Meanwhile, almost 95% of Malaysia’s adult population have received a complete dose of vaccines, according to the health ministry’s data.Russia Deaths, Cases Remain Near Record (4:17 p.m. HK)Russian coronavirus cases and deaths remained near record levels on Sunday ahead of the implementation of strict nationwide curbs to stem a surge in infections.There were 35,660 new cases and 1,072 deaths over the past day, slightly below records set Saturday, according to data from the national coronavirus headquarters. Last week, President Vladimir Putin ordered nationwide non-working days for the first week of November to slow the spread, while Moscow will be closed for most business from Oct. 28 through Nov. 7.China Expects Outbreak to Widen (4:08 p.m. HK)China’s new Covid-19 infections will increase in coming days and the areas affected by the pandemic may continue to expand.The current outbreak in China is caused by the delta variant, Wu Liangyou, an official at the National Health Commission, said at a briefing in Beijing on Sunday. The outbreak has expanded to 11 provinces in the week since Oct. 17, Mi Feng, a spokesman for the commission, said at the same briefing.Earlier on Sunday, Beijing authorities announced the city is halting cross-province tourism and closing card and majhong rooms. China’s capital will also cut the number of large events and increase supervision over small clinics and pharmacies, according to the official WeChat account of the Beijing Municipal Health Commission.Belgium to Weigh Stricter Rules (3:21 p.m. HK)Belgian Prime Minister Alexander de Croo will meet with his cabinet Monday to discuss the virus situation and consider tighter curbs. The government is mulling a return to stricter mask rules, Belga reports, citing a government spokesman. Belgium, like other European countries, is seeing rising infections, with more than 8.5 million of a population of about 11.5 million being fully vaccinated. ©2021 Bloomberg L.P.With assistance from Bloomberg.

Just like last year, Halloween will look a little different as public health officials encourage people to implement measures to help curb the pandemic at a time when Saskatchewan is still experiencing high levels of COVID-19. Creative ways to maintain physical distancing while handing out candy include using tongs to pass it out or sliding it down a pipe. Sticking with your own household or small groups of close friends this Halloween is also recommended. Both trick-or-treaters and those handing out treats should wear a mask. It’s important to note that Halloween masks aren’t a substitute for medical ones. Other safety tips include cleaning and disinfecting common touch areas like handrails, doorbells and doorknobs frequently while handing out candy. Kids should carry sanitizer with them. Only individually wrapped candy should be accepted and you may want to consider a quarantine or disinfection of the wrappers before consuming the candy. The Government of Saskatchewan said proof of vaccination and masking orders remain in effect for any Halloween celebrations at public venues. The City of Prince Albert said with Halloween falling on a Sunday this year, there is an expectation that more kids will be out and about collecting treats. Similar to last year, the city created two posters that residents can print off to indicate if they will be participating in festivities. “People’s decision to participate should be respected. The Halloween posters are a simple way to let people know if you’re participating in Halloween this year,“ said Jim Toye, city manager. “The posters were tremendously popular last year, so we are making them available again this year.” The posters are can be downloaded here. Parkland Ambulance is also offering some safety tips this Halloween including waiting until children are home to sort and check treats. In a media release, Parkland Ambulance wrote ‘though tampering is rare, a responsible adult should closely examine all treats and throw away any spoiled, unwrapped or suspicious items.’ More safety tips can be found below.

Similar to last year, the city created two posters that residents can print off to indicate if they will be participating in festivities. “People’s decision to participate should be respected. The Halloween posters are a simple way to let people know if you’re participating in Halloween this year,“ said Jim Toye, city manager. “The posters were tremendously popular last year, so we are making them available again this year.” The posters are can be downloaded here . Parkland Ambulance is also offering some safety tips this Halloween including waiting until children are home to sort and check treats. In a media release, Parkland Ambulance wrote ‘though tampering is rare, a responsible adult should closely examine all treats and throw away any spoiled, unwrapped or suspicious items.’ More safety tips can be found below. — panews@pattisonmedia.com On Twitter: @princealbertNOW",https://s3.amazonaws.com/socast-superdesk/media/20211019201032/f3f234ed-41f6-4a6e-829d-cc99626b47c2.png,panow

Philip Murphy's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, taxation and COVID executive orders on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight.""",,2021-10-26 02:46:18,"close Video NJ gov candidate Jack Ciattarelli responds to Murphy's comments about lockdown orders Republican challenger tells 'Tucker Carlson Tonight' the Democrat is 'way to extreme' for the blue Garden State. New Jersey Republican gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli joined "" Tucker Carlson Tonight "" on Monday to respond to Gov. Philip Murphy's taxation policies and previous comments about whether the consideration that his socioeconomic lockdown orders violated the Constitution might be ""above my pay grade."" Host Tucker Carlson reminded the audience of Murphy's last appearance on the program in April 2020 -- when New Jersey and its surrounding Democrat-run states instituted sweeping mandates against religious or family gatherings and operations of businesses like gyms and restaurants . In April 2020, Carlson asked Murphy about a case in which 15 men were arrested for congregating at a Lakewood, N.J., synagogue for the funeral of Orthodox Rabbi Chaim Moshe Strulovics in violation of his executive order banning large gatherings. 'The Bill of Rights, as you well know, protects Americans' rights — enshrines their right to practice their religion as they see fit and to congregate together to assemble peacefully,"" Carlson said. ""By what authority did you nullify the Bill of Rights in issuing this order? How do you have the power to do that?"" ""That's above my pay grade, Tucker,"" Murphy responded. ""I wasn't thinking of the Bill of Rights when we did this ... we looked at all the data and the science and it says people have to stay away from each other. That is the best thing we can do to break the back of the curve of this virus, that leads to lower hospitalization and ultimately fatalities.""

Phil Murphy, who salutes him on stage, during an early vote rally at Weequahic Park, Saturday, Oct. 23, 2021, in Newark, N.J. (AP Photo/Stefan Jeremiah) In response, Ciattarelli said that while Democrats hold about a 1 million voter advantage in the Garden State, many New Jersey Democrats are ""fiscally conservative and socially moderate."" ""This guy is just way too extreme,"" he said, noting that no Democratic governor has been reelected in the state since Gov. Brendan Byrne in the late 1970s. Carlson went on to compare Murphy to former Gov. Jim Florio, a Democrat of the early 1990s whose plan to hike taxes in the billions upset so many New Jersey voters that they responded by giving Republicans their first legislative majority in Trenton in decades. ""Phil Murphy has done the same thing [as Jim Florio], he's gone way too far left,"" replied Ciattarelli, formerly a state lawmaker and county freeholder from Somerset. ""A year and a half ago on this very show, [Murphy claimed] ‘the Bill of Rights is above my pay grade’. -- It’s not funny. But worse than that, he told the highest taxed people in the nation ‘ if taxes are issue, we are probably not your state ’."" Incumbent Gov.

Seattle's Pike Place Market struggles to find footing since COVID-19,https://www.startribune.com/seattles-pike-place-market-struggles-to-find-footing-since-covid-19/600109609/,,"['Paul Roberts', ' Seattle Times']",,,,2021-10-24 19:00:00,"Like many vendors at Pike Place Market in Seattle, Scott Chang isn't sure when business will resume its pre-COVID normal. True, this summer brought welcome crowds of tourists and locals to the open-air Seattle landmark. Sales at See Lee Gardens, the flower business owned by Chang's family, are nearly back where they were before the pandemic shuttered the market's picturesque warren of stalls and shops. But there's another, more somber reason for See Lee's rebound: Several competing flower vendors haven't come back to the market, or are only there a few days a week. They now sell at other outlets that don't require the long commute into downtown Seattle. Even Chang, for the first time, is selling some of his flowers elsewhere, partly as a hedge against future COVID-related disruptions. ""We're never going to quit Pike Place,"" says Chang, 36, of the place that has hosted his family business since the 1980s. But the pandemic ""was a big eye-opener that we have to look for other venues."" Fifty years after Pike Place Market was nearly razed in the name of progress, the sprawling institution faces another, even more complex nemesis. Although many of the market's more than 500 businesses saw solid sales this summer, visitor numbers are still below their 2019 levels. Many vendors and farmers are still on reduced hours, and dozens haven't returned or are squarely on the fence about coming back. Though most of the market's 222 restaurants, shops and other brick-and-mortar tenants are back, just 69 of 96 farmers and 147 of 186 crafters had returned as of Oct. 6, market officials said. All told, the market's business community is still down by around 15% from 2019. ""It truly is up in the air right now,"" says Jim Johnson, owner of Olympia-based Johnson Berry Farm, a 22-year market stalwart that hasn't been back since last fall. Even many of those vendors who have made it back did so by shifting how — and sometimes where — they do business as they prepare for their second pandemic winter. Collectively, it points to changes for an iconic, eclectic retail community that was facing challenges before COVID, including labor shortages and competition from online retailers and from a proliferation of farmers markets in virtually every town and neighborhood. Although Pike Place Market remains the region's go-to source for a fully immersive ""meet the producer"" experience, ""we can't live on it alone,"" says Mary Bacarella, executive director of the Pike Place Market Preservation and Development Authority (PDA), which owns and manages the 9-acre, 14-building complex. The market, Bacarella, ""has to adapt."" Revenue for the PDA, which charges some tenants a percentage of retail sales, fell from a record $22.6 million in 2019 to $13.2 million in 2020, leading to cost-cutting and layoffs of 15% of its staff. The PDA offered tenants $3.7 million in rental assistance. The market's fundraising arm, the Pike Place Market Foundation, offered nearly $700,000 in small-business grants. Paycheck Protection Program loans helped. Individual businesses, meanwhile, came up with their own adaptations. At the Sound View Cafe, Alex Amon, whose family purchased the place almost 30 years ago, completely re-engineered the menu, replacing many complicated higher-end items with simpler selections that ""were more cost-efficient for us."" Like retailers everywhere, many market vendors also found ways to rely less on face-to-face sales. But some vendors also found ways to reduce their reliance on the market itself. ""To help pick up the slack"" in sales, Holmquist Hazelnut Orchards stepped up sales at 16 other regional farmers markets, many of which were thriving even as Pike Place struggled, said co-owner Richard Holmquist. For some of the market's older vendors, the pandemic was simply a good moment to retire. Vickie Clark Rafael, a 66-year-old jeweler in Shoreline, has operated a day stall for more than 40 years. Though she hasn't returned since the pandemic struck, she had planned to stay on until 70, but is now unsure. ""This whole COVID reality has made things so challenging to decide what to do,"" she says.",,startribune

LINGARD SET FOR TRANSFER INTEREST As many as 12 Premier League clubs could join the January transfer hunt for Manchester United midfielder Jesse Lingard, one journalist has claimed. The 28-year-old was once a key player for the Red Devils, but his influence has waned. Indeed, he became frozen out under manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and sought a move away. While Lingard impressed on loan at West Ham last season, though, he has gone back to a similar level of game time as before. In fact, he has only played 55 minutes in the Premier League across four games this term. Overall, meanwhile, he has played 146 minutes in seven Man Utd outings. As such, speculation has emerged again that Lingard could leave again, this time for good, especially since his contract expires next summer. According to Sky Sports News journalist Michael Bridge, Newcastle – with their new super-rich owners – will be one of several Premier League clubs thinking about signing him in the coming months. “I think Lingard will definitely be the talk of January,” the reporter told Give Me Sport. “I’d imagine Newcastle will go for him. I’d say about 12 Premier League clubs will probably register an interest.” Previous reports have claimed that Everton lead West Ham in the race for the England international, who continues to impress Three Lions boss Gareth Southgate despite his lack of club minutes. But Lingard is not the only United player tipped for an exit in January.

Getty Images The Green Bay Packers placed wide receiver Davante Adams on the reserve/COVID-19 list Monday. Being placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list is for a player who either tests positive for COVID-19 or who has been in close contact with an infected person or persons. Adams ranks second in the NFL with 52 catches and is third in yards (744). Green Bay (6-1) travels to Arizona (7-0) Thursday for an NFC showdown, and playing without Adams would be an enormous blow to the Packers. Green Bay learned earlier on Monday that defensive coordinator Joe Barry had also tested positive for COVID-19 and will likely miss Thursday’s game in Arizona. “You have to take it in stride and just approach it with positive mind and a positive attitude and just make the best of whatever situation you encounter,” Packers coach Matt LaFleur said. After a rocky start to his career, Adams — a second round draft pick in 2014 — has developed into one of the top receivers in football. Adams was named to the Pro Bowl each season from 2017-20 and he was named first-team All-Pro in 2020. Adams was the NFL’s No. 1 rated wide receiver by Pro Football Focus last season. Adams set a franchise record with 115 receptions and posted 1,374 receiving yards (11.9 avg.) a year ago despite missing two games. He also matched Sterling Sharpe’s single-season team record for receiving touchdowns (18) set in 1994.

He led the NFL in receiving TDs, receiving yards per game (98.1) and receptions per game (8.2), becoming the first NFL player to lead the league in all three categories since Sharpe did so in 1992. Adams earned first-team All-Pro honors from The Associated Press, the first Packers wide receiver to receive first-team recognition since Antonio Freeman in 1998. He also earned first-team All-NFL honors from the Pro Football Writers Association. “There’s a reason he’s got that ‘99’ rating in Madden,” LaFleur said recently. “He is a baller.

Gansu province lies along the ancient Silk Road and is famed for the Dunhuang grottoes filled with Buddhist images and other religious sites. The National Health Commission said 35 new cases of local transmission had been detected over the past 24 hours, four of them in Gansu. Another 19 cases were found in the Inner Mongolia region, with others spread across several provinces and cities. Residents in parts of Inner Mongolia have been ordered to stay indoors. Despite having largely stamped out cases of local infection, China maintains a zero-tolerance policy toward the pandemic, characterized by lockdowns, quarantines and compulsory testing for the virus. The spread of the delta variant by travelers and tour groups is of particular concern ahead of the Winter Olympics in Beijing in February. Overseas spectators already are banned, and participants will have to stay in a bubble separating them from people outside. Authorities in the capital said on Sunday people arriving from places with recent infections would need to show a negative virus test result and give regular health reports.

KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 25 — As Japan gears up for its general election on Oct 31, a city in Gunma Prefecture is racing against time to sharpen pencils for voters to use.This is part of the Covid-19 pandemic measure to prevent the spread of the virus, Sora News 24 reported.The city, Ota, anticipates a voter turnout of over 100,000 voters where they will vote using voter slips and pencils.To minimise the spread of the virus, voters in the city will take the pencils home after they fill up their ballot papers.This means one voter needs to be allotted one pencil.To complicate matters, early voting has been brought forward, meaning that the specially treated, bacteria-resistant pencils, that do not come pre-sharpened, needed to be ordered in a hurry to meet the deadline. City employees are now tasked to sharpen the pencils during their breaks in between work. One Twitter user criticised the city for getting civil servants to sharpen the pencils.“Why not order disposable pencils ? Each of these costs between six and seven yen (22 sen to 26 sen). You’re currently wasting labor costs.” なぜ使い捨て鉛筆のペグシルを発注しないのか？1本当たり6〜7円ですし、これでは人件費の無駄使いですよ。【衆院選 市職員が鉛筆1万本削る】 pic.twitter.com/Dfpo7JiLbz— TOMOKIN 友金良太 (@TOMOKIN_Voice) October 19, 2021 Another social media user said after shaving a few pencils, his fingers felt numb.“So spare a thought for the hardworking pencil sharpeners in Ota, and cross your own fingers that they manage to supply enough pencils for all the voters that need them.”",2021-10-25 04:57:42,,,malaymail

Ngayon nakita natin we were able to defeat Delta (Now, we have seen that we were able to defeat Delta),"" Galvez had said.Vergeire believes Galvez made the statement in the context of earlier projections that the country may mirror the experiences of India and Indonesia, where a surge of Delta cases affected their overall response.""We were expecting talaga na magkakaroon ng sobrang taas na kaso, tayo ay ma-o-overwhelm, marami ang mamamatay, pero hindi po natin naabot 'yung projected number of cases at 'yung overwhelmed [na] health system (We were expecting high cases, that we may get overwhelmed and many will die, but we never reached the projected number),"" she said.She added that while the country' health system was challenged because of the Delta surge, prompt actions by the government led to a reduction of cases one and a half months after the variant was first detected.""Hindi po natin sinasabi na 'natalo' na natin ang Delta, ang Delta po, nandito pa sa atin... pero ang pinakamaganda, we were able to control and reduce the number of cases and naisaayos natin ang (We never said that we 'defeated' Delta, as Delta remained here in the country, but what is good is that we were able to control and reduce the number of cases and we have fixed our) health system capacity,"" Vergeire said.The Philippines has a low-risk classification of Covid-19 with a two-week growth rate of -48 percent and an average daily attack rate of nearly 5.9 cases per 100,000 population.The National Capital Region is under moderate risk with a -53-percent decrease in the two-week growth rate and ADAR of 8.56 cases per 100,000 population.On Monday, the country reported 4,405 new Covid-19 cases for a total of 2.761 million cases.",,2021-10-25 17:00:36,,https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2021/10/26/22598.jpg,manilatimes

She says it was important to humanize Big Meech and Southwest T","BMF is the Starz network’s latest crime drama. Executive produced by Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson, the show, centers on the Flenory brothers’ rise and fall. Demetrius “Big Meech” Flenory (Demetrius “Lil Meech” Flenory Jr.) and Terry “Southwest T” Flenory (Da’Vinchi) began their career as small-time drug dealers in Detroit before rising to become two of the biggest drug traffickers in the country. Though the brothers were eventually imprisoned for their crimes, BMF director Tasha Smith says it’s important to humanize them and their story. Tasha Smith | Rodin Eckenroth/WireImage RELATED: What Does 50 Cent’s New Starz Show ‘BMF’ Stand For? ‘BMF’ is based on a true story The Flenory brothers came of age in the 1980s in Detroit. They began their career when they were just teens selling bags of cocaine for $50. However, when the crack cocaine epidemic exploded, their business skyrocketed. Creator and showrunner Randy Huggins was born and raised in Detroit amid the same era, so he wanted the story to remain as accurate as possible. “I took some liberties, but everything there is based on a story,” Huggins told Urban Hollywood 411. “Obviously, you can’t have people’s names in there. Obviously, some of the places may have changed.” He added, “I don’t think there’s a character in there, that I hadn’t heard of,” he said. “I may have to take a creative liberty to make an art pop a little bit more. I may have to take a creative license to make a scene funnier than it may have been, but that’s just part of telling a story. This is not a documentary.” ⁦@bmfstarz⁩ watch now on Starz! pic.twitter.com/77CuDRTaQM— Tasha (@tashasmith4real) September 26, 2021 RELATED: ‘BMF’: Who Is Eminem’s Character White Boy Rick? ‘BMF’ director Tasha Smith wanted to humanize Big Meech and Southwest T In 2005 both Southwest T and Big Meech were sentenced to prison for money laundering and drug trafficking. Southwest T was released in early 2021 amid COVID-19 (coronavirus) concerns while Big Meech will remain in jail until 2028. No one is questioning the illegality of their enterprise. However, director/actor Tasha Smith wanted to humanize the men instead of vilifying them. “I just wanted to give a little justice to the story of Big Meech and Terry Flenory and people like them by putting some humanity on it,” Smith told TV Line. “When you think about crime and crime lords, the fictional Corleones and the real Gottis are embraced. A lot of times, when it comes to the Black community, there is a stigma where other communities are glorified. But BMF shows some empathy and understanding on the way these brothers were brought up in a two-parent home.” RELATED: 50 Cent Says the Success of ‘Power’ Made Starz Official Demetrius ‘Lil Meech’ Flenory Jr. wanted to make his father proud When it comes to portraying his father, Lil Meech did not take the task lightly. The actor spoke with his father every day while filming and he anxiously awaited his response to the pilot. “No one’s credibility amounts to his,” he told The Source. “I just want him to tell me he’s proud- he’s seen it, and he’s happy I did it and I killed it.

Bayern Munich club members move to end Qatar Airways sponsorship at general assembly,https://www.bavarianfootballworks.com/2021/10/25/22745330/bayern-munich-club-members-qatar-airways-sponsorship-annual-general-assembly-world-cup-2022,,['John Dillon'],,,"Bayern Munich board member Andreas Jung with Hamad International Airport CEO Akbar al-Baker after the club signed a new sponsorship deal, August 14, 2017. | Photo credit should read STRINGER/AFP/Getty Images Bayern’s hotly debated sponsorship by Qatar Airways will be discussed at the club’s upcoming Annual General Assembly in November. A motion initiated by Bayern Munich club member Michael Ott has gained traction and attention ahead of the club’s upcoming annual general assembly on November 25: Ott has filed a motion that would oblige Bayern to allow its sponsorship deal with Qatar Airways (2016/17-2022/23) to expire and forbid the club to conclude further sponsoring deals with companies of which a majority is owned by the Qatari Emirate. The motion, which can be found online at http://katar-antrag.de/, reads in translation as follows: May the members’ assembly resolve: FC Bayern Munich e.V. [registered club], through exercise of all necessary legal and factional avenues at its disposal, influences FC Bayern Munich AG [corporation] to the effect that sponsoring contracts with Qatar Airways or other companies majority-owned by the Emirate of Qatar are allowed to expire and not extended or not concluded de novo. [Editor: FC Bayern e.V. is the overarching club, which is majority owner of FC Bayern AG, the corporation that comprises the original soccer branch of the club. The annual general assembly includes the entire FC Bayern, from the chess team to the soccer team.] Ott sets out the justification for the measure in five detailed points. He told Bild, “We want to take preventative measures to prevent a new contract.” The principal reason is Qatar’s history of human rights violations. Ott explains, “Qatar Airways is 100% owned by the Emirate of Qatar. This country stands for massive human rights violations, and there moreover are serious charges of corruption in sports. Instead of effecting change, FC Bayern is actively helping the Emirate of Qatar with its sponsorship to draw attention away from these evils.” With such “indifference,” Ott argues, FC Bayern damages its own reputation and “falls short of its status as an exemplary model.” The motion would not, however, preclude Bayern from traveling to its annual training camp at the Aspire Academy in Doha, Qatar. Ott said that the event provides “an opportunity for critical communication, at least in theory.” I have commented several times on Bayern Munich’s relationship with Qatar Airways over the years. Bayern first visited Qatar in 2011, not long after Qatar made its controversial, and ultimately successful, bid to host World Cup 2022. Qatar’s Hamad International Airport became a “platinum sponsor” of the club in 2016, leading to the notorious Qatar Airways sleeve sponsorship in 2017. Recently, controversy over Qatar has been overshadowed by other themes, notably the Bayern leadership’s indignant response to insults leveled by its ultras at TSG Hoffenheim owner Dietmar Hopp, ensuing—arguably belated—engagement with the Black Lives Matter movement, and above all the Coronavirus pandemic. Even as the club still finds itself navigating difficult waters with respect to COVID-19 and vaccination, the subject of Qatar has not gone away. As World Cup 2022 looms on the horizon, despite the logistical nightmare a winter World Cup will create and ongoing allegations of corruption in the award process, the theme is bound to remain relevant.

Read More",2021-10-25 11:44:06,"BUCHAREST/MOSCOW — Russia reported a record high number of daily COVID-19 cases and some central European countries imposed fresh restrictions on Monday, as a new wave of the pandemic gathered pace. In Asia, the Red Cross called for urgent help for Papua New Guinea and China’s latest outbreak forced the capital Beijing to delay its annual marathon and step up other curbs, less than four months before it hosts the Winter Olympics. Authorities around the world have been sounding the alarm as infections surge, with governments in regions where vaccine uptake has been low forced to toughen up restrictions in a bid to stop the virus raging out of control. Russia on Monday reported 37,930 new COVID-19 infections in the last 24 hours, its highest single-day case tally since the start of the pandemic. Frustrated by the slow take-up of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine by its own population, authorities are introducing stricter measures this week to try to curb the spread of the pandemic. President Vladimir Putin last week declared that Oct. 30 to Nov. 7 would be paid non-working days. Vaccine skepticism is high across central and eastern Europe and as a result the region has become a hotspot. Tougher restrictions came into force in Romania and the Czech Republic on Monday, while in Slovakia stricter rules were expanded to more regions. In Bulgaria, police will start imposing fines on people who break restrictions from Monday. In Romania, where a government official on Saturday lamented a “disaster situation,” the government reintroduced a night curfew and made health passes mandatory for entry to most public venues, while school children were sent on vacation for two weeks. “The restrictions seem to be working, there are fewer people on the streets,” said Gheorghe Ion, a Bucharest cab driver. “I’ve been waiting here for an hour without an order.” Poland’s health minister warned that the government would need to consider tighter restrictions if cases kept increasing, but stressed that it was not planning a lockdown. While experts have said that a lack of confidence in public institutions caused by decades of Communist rule has fueled vaccine skepticism in the region, there were signs that more people were responding to fears about the wave by getting a jab. In Romania authorities said inoculations were on the rise last week, while in the Czech Republic the daily number of doses administered was the highest since late-August. URGENT EFFORTS The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies warned of the potential for huge numbers of deaths in Papua New Guinea unless international action was taken to help the island nation’s struggling health service. Less than 1% of the population has been fully vaccinated, according to Our World in Data figures, with the Red Cross blaming misinformation, public apprehension, and logistical challenges. “Urgent efforts and further support are needed in healthcare to prevent a massive loss of life in the coming days and weeks,” Uvenama Rova, PNG Red Cross secretary general, said. Chinese health officials warned on Sunday that its latest cluster, caused by the highly transmissible Delta variant and involving many carriers who recently traveled across some provinces, was increasingly likely to expand further. Beijing has banned entry of people from other cities with cases, and closed indoor venues such as some chess and card parlors, even in districts without infections. Although the infection numbers are far smaller than many places outside China, authorities have adopted a zero tolerance strategy. New Zealand saw its second-highest daily tally of COVID-19 cases since the pandemic began, with 109 new locally acquired coronavirus cases reported on Monday, the bulk of them in its largest city, Auckland. Once lauded for its success in stamping out the virus, New Zealand has been struggling with an outbreak of the Delta variant centered in Auckland, despite the city remaining under a strict lockdown for more than two months. In Western Europe cases were also on the rise, despite higher rates of vaccine uptake than in the continent’s east. Infections in the Netherlands have been rising for a month and reached their highest level since July on Sunday, after many social distancing measures were dropped in late September. Prime Minister Mark Rutte is expected to update coronavirus policies by Nov. 5, but pressure is rising to come up with an earlier response to the recent numbers.

On Monday, the province announced 90 per cent of all eligible adults have received their first vaccine dose, while 85 per cent have received their second. Among all eligible British Columbians (aged 12 and up), 89.6 per cent have received one dose and 84.4 per cent have received both doses. Fraser Health continues to record the most new cases, with 699 in the past three days. It also has the most active cases, with 2,030 of the 4,966 province-wide. Interior Health recorded the most deaths over the weekend with six in that region. Four people died in each of Fraser Health and Northern Health. There were three deaths in each of Vancouver Coastal Health and Island Health.

Capacity limits lifted for many B.C. venues On Monday, COVID-19 restrictions were further relaxed in most of B.C., with restaurants, movie theatres, performance venues, and arenas once again allowed to operate at full capacity. The easing of restrictions means guests are now allowed to mingle and do not need to stay in their seats. Venues are also now able to determine their own table limits and liquor service hours are returning to normal. There are some health rules still in place: everyone must be double vaccinated and everyone must be masked indoors. In addition, there is still no dancing allowed, which wedding planners have called disappointing and concert venues have said is confusing.

Events and certain non-essential settings in Abbotsford, Harrison Hot Springs, Boston Bar, Mission, Hope, Chilliwack, and Agassiz are only open to those who are double vaccinated, and even then, attendance is limited.

Taxing the super rich,https://www.manilatimes.net/2021/10/25/business/top-business/taxing-the-super-rich/1819612,['Business'],['Jenny Say-Ng'],,"Will the newly filed House Bill 10253 or the proposed Super Rich Tax Act follow the various tax reforms introduced by the Duterte administration and become law? The bill aims to levy an annual tax starting January 1, 2022 on citizens (residents and nonresidents alike) and resident aliens at the rate of 1 percent on wealth above P1 billion, 2 percent on wealth above P2 billion, and 3 percent on wealth above P3 billion.Around P236.7 billion is expected to be raised annually from the 50 richest Filipinos alone, to be used to help the government pursue anti-poverty measures and other social programs aimed at closing the widening divide between the rich and the poor, according to the bill's explanatory note. Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III's initial comment was that the wealth tax would drive capital out of the Philippines. How justified is this?The wealth tax is not new. In 2018, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) published a tax policy study focusing on wealth taxes. It showed that 12 OECD countries that used to have wealth taxes repealed these in the 1990s and 2000s and that the number of OECD countries that continued to impose wealth taxes had dwindled to just four by 2017. Based on the OECD study, many factors have been put forward to justify the repeal of net wealth taxes, one of which is the risk of capital flight, specifically due to increased capital mobility and access to tax havens. Hence, Dominguez's concern on the proposed super rich tax may be valid.Another factor that contributed to the repeal of wealth taxes — one that may apply to the Philippines — is the high cost of tax administration compared to limited revenues. In the Super Rich Tax bill, the net value of all taxable assets is defined as the market value of assets owned by a taxpayer, real or personal, tangible or intangible, wherever situated, reduced by debts owed by the taxpayer. While the definition may be simple, assessing the market value of all assets will be a very difficult exercise.While the market value of real properties, traded stocks, and other similarly traded assets may be easily obtained, hard-to-value assets such as intangibles, artwork, and the like may be harder to assess. In effect, it will take a chunk of the resources on the part of the tax office and the individual to ascertain the correct valuation — and this needs to be done on an annual basis. It is a considerable challenge in terms of tax administration and enforcing compliance.Further, taking into consideration the computation of net taxable assets wherein debts are allowable deductions, the OECD study mentioned that the wealth tax provides incentives for borrowing to lower the tax base and thus can encourage tax avoidance and, in effect, lower the revenue that should have been collected from the wealth tax.Let us look at some of the merits of imposing a wealth tax following the OECD study:First, the wealth tax aims to address wealth inequality and will help promote equality of opportunity following the foremost point in the OECD study. Although the Philippines levies taxes on passive and active income, considering that the ultra-rich already have a high value of accumulated wealth to begin with, the after-tax earnings (also substantial as these are proportionate to the capital/investment) they receive will only be added to their total wealth, thereby increasing their wealth over time.This is pointed out in the proposed bill. Based on the 2021 Forbes list of the Philippines' 50 richest, these folks grew their wealth by 30 percent to P4 trillion despite the Covid-19 pandemic. This is against a backdrop of 29 percent of Filipinos, or over six million families, living on a monthly income of P10,000 or less for two decades, with salaries and worker wages nationwide slightly increasing only to adjust for inflation. This gaping divide has resulted in 50 Filipinos owning more wealth than the poorest 71 million Filipinos combined.The second argument supporting the wealth tax, according to the OECD study, is that wealth provides benefits above and beyond income. Wealth may bestow social status, power, greater opportunities, satisfaction or provide an insurance value against unexpected future needs and it has been argued that such benefits should be taxed (Meade, 1978). This holds true in the Philippines where it is the wealthy that usually wield the power and have access to better opportunities.With government debt sitting at P11.64 trillion as of August 2021 and the Covid-19 pandemic still an ongoing battle, legislators are looking for ways to generate more taxes. This is seen in the various tax measures being proposed, including the Super Rich Tax bill. In deliberating the proposed measure, Congress will no doubt look at the pros and cons of levying a wealth tax. Let us hope our legislators are able to establish additional provisions as necessary for this proposal to be an effective tax-generating measure.The author is a senior manager with the Tax and Corporate Services Division of Navarro Amper & Co., a member of the Deloitte Asia Pacific Network.

He termed the project an important document on the history of Arunachal Pradesh at a meeting with the members of the core committee and sub-committee for the recognition of the State's unsung heroes, here on Saturday. The State government had in September formed a five-member core committee headed by Mein to conduct research on the contribution of various personalities of the state in the country's freedom struggle. The committee has been tasked with collecting and examining authentic documents, archives, journals, available in the libraries and other places, seeking comments of eminent personalities and others in this regard, visiting places of relevant historical interests and taking steps as deemed fit to give recognition to the unsung freedom fighters of Arunachal. The research work and documentation, after being compiled and completed, would be forwarded to the State government. Chief Minister Pema Khandu who has been spearheading the initiative had told the Assembly in September that the State government would build a memorial for all the ""unsung"" freedom fighters from the State, besides requesting the Centre to also honour them. Mein on the occasion also informed the members of the house that the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR), a captive body of the Union Ministry of Education, is planning to conduct a workshop-cum-seminar in the State early next year as part of Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav. He asked Rajiv Gandhi University Vice-Chancellor Saket Kushwaha and member secretary of the core committee, Dani Salu, to coordinate with the member-secretary of ICHR. Meanwhile, the house present decided to propose the ICHR to set up a centre in Arunachal Pradesh. Such a centre in the State would facilitate the research scholars and students carrying out research works and studies on the rich history and culture of Arunachal Pradesh, the members of the panel said. The committee also decided to participate in the live online series on social media on unsung heroes which would be conducted by ICHR. Prof Kushwaha during the meeting, presented a timeline to be followed by the sub-committee which shall work under the aegis of the RGU. According to the timeline, the sub-committee will submit the final report by the end of June 2022. In the meeting, Nepha Wangsa, author of The Nyinu Massacre, showed the collection of original documents from the national archive of the British Library in New Delhi. These documents will be handed over to the core committee through a formal ceremony at a later date. The house decided to store it in the State archive of the research department and also to put it on a website after the finalization of the research and documentation works. The meeting was also attended by education minister Taba Tedir, advisor to Chief Minister Tai Tagak, advisor to Deputy Chief Minister Anupam Tangu and RGU registrar N T Rikam, an official communiqué informed on Sunday.

NYC workers vaccine mandate protest shuts down Brooklyn Bridge traffic into Manhattan,https://www.foxnews.com/us/nyc-workers-protest-vaccine-mandate-in-brooklyn-bridge-march,,['Pilar Arias'],,New York City municipal employees are marching across the Brooklyn Bridge Monday against the COVID-19 vaccine mandate.,,2021-10-25 17:43:16,"close Video Vivek Ramaswamy: Vaccine mandate protests are the result of rampant lies on COVID-19 by public officials The ‘Outnumbered’ panel reacts to protests over vaccine mandates in New York City and CDC Director Walensky’s comments about education for the unvaccinated New York City municipal employees are marching across the Brooklyn Bridge Monday against the COVID-19 vaccine mandate. The protest, which is set to end in front of City Hall on the Manhattan side of the bridge, is billed as an anti-mandate protest on behalf of nearly 50,000 NYC employees who have yet to be vaccinated with a deadline just days away. Traffic is shut down on the Brooklyn Bridge into Manhattan as of 11:49 a.m., according to police. NYC'S BARCLAY'S CENTER SWARMED BY PROTESTERS SUPPORTING NETS' KYRIE IRVING'S REFUSAL TO BE VACCINATED PIX11 reports all city workers must have their first shot of the coronavirus vaccine by 5 p.m. Friday if they want to come to work the morning of Nov. 1. Monday's protest follows a protest Sunday night at the Barclay's Center in support of Kyrie Irving. A crowd of people rallied as the Brooklyn Nets lost to the Charlotte Hornets at their home opener without their point guard. At one point the protest turned violent when some demonstrators tried to break into the arena, clashing with security and police. Irving has refused to get vaccinated. As a result, he's not getting paid. The same could soon be said for thousands of city workers if they don't get the shot by Friday. That's the threat from Mayor Bill de Blasio with vaccination rates lagging behind the general population at several large city agencies including the NYPD and the FDNYP. NEW YORK CITY POLICE UNION THREATENS LEGAL ACTION OVER DE BLASIO VACCINE MANDATE ""It's time now. If you don't want to get vaccinated, you'll be put on unpaid leave. Well, the vast majority of human beings go to work to get paid. And also, I think for a lot of our first responders, there's a calling. They believe in the work, they care about the work. Those two factors I think are going to cause the vast majority to get vaccinated,"" Mayor de Blasio said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The mayor did offer a $500 incentive for city workers to get vaccinated and even that's causing controversy, with several unions now demanding back pay for workers who already got vaccinated without a bonus.

Residents in swaths of the province will be allowed to attend events like hockey games, concerts and weddings without any limits on numbers, but capacity will be capped at 50 per cent in areas where vaccination rates are low, including parts of the Fraser, Northern and Interior health regions. Attendees at all organized events in B.C. will be required to wear face coverings and show proof of COVID-19 vaccination. The move was eagerly anticipated by businesses, including those that require bookings well in advance for events like weddings. Harpal Sooch, owner of the Grand Taj Banquet Hall in Surrey, said he's cautiously optimistic about an uptick in business even as most large banquets were cancelled and won't be going ahead until next summer. ""This is my bread and butter for me and my family. Same thing for my partner, and same thing with all the banquet halls that are mostly run by families. We were closed for 15 months,"" he said of the toll on his finances. Sooch said the hall has been booked for two upcoming gatherings for Diwali — one next Saturday and another two weeks later — and he's hoping the business will start thriving again as more people return to socializing as usual. But Sooch said not everyone is ready for pre-pandemic-type parties while they still need to wear masks, especially seniors waiting for booster shots and families with children under 12 who can't yet be vaccinated. ""They're not getting into it. But hopefully everything goes on so by next summer we'll be fine,"" he said. ""That's what we're hoping for."" Heidi Tworek, a professor who specializes in health communications at the University of British Columbia's School of Public Policy and Global Affairs, said employers, businesses expecting more customers and even individuals inviting someone over for dinner should expect a range of reactions because the lack of regular contact with people after nearly two years will have impacted some people's mental health. ""There's sometimes a baseline assumption that every single person is eager to go back immediately to full capacity,"" she said, adding that while most people will have to get used to gathering with others outside their usual circle of contacts, those with an anxiety disorder will have a more difficult time being around those they don't know. People with specific health concerns in particular may ask about ventilation improvements at buildings, including their workplace, in order to feel safe so it will be crucial to provide that information while being patient and flexible, Tworek said. ""There are a lot of people who are immunocompromised or have other reasons to be concerned, who feel like there isn't transparency,"" she said, noting parents of schoolchildren in the Vancouver area spearheaded their own efforts to document and share COVID-19 exposures so families could decide to keep their child home to protect older or ill individuals. Government announcements about reopenings should include messaging for people who are reluctant to resume activities while the pandemic is ongoing, Tworek said. The day after capacity limits lift, British Columbia will require all health-care workers in the province to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, after an Oct. 12 deadline for employees in long-term care and assisted living facilities. Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry has said she expanded her order to all health-care settings partly to prevent unvaccinated staff working with seniors from jumping to jobs elsewhere.

He told the city’s ABC News affiliate that the “draconian” mandate would harm all New Yorkers. “We already don’t have enough cops, we don’t have enough corrections officers, we don’t have enough health care workers, we don’t have enough teachers...,” he said. “Stop this nonsense and the mandate.” Like this story?

That from an email received from the Algoma District School Board (ADSB). The ADSB has been working closely with Algoma Public Health (APH) to support several contact tracing investigations after positive COVID-19 tests were linked to individuals connected to River View Public School. APH declared a facility-wide COVID-19 outbreak at River View Thursday. The ADSB says there are six confirmed cases of COVID-19 among individuals associated with River View Public School. “Given the current number of cases, the high absenteeism rate (opting for virtual) and the number of classes already pivoted to hybrid, effective Monday, October 25th, all classes at River View P.S. will move to virtual for at least ten days. Please note that this decision is precautionary and intended to support the best scenario of staffing and supervision, while reducing the potential for additional asymptomatic spread. ADSB will be communicating with families closer to the proposed return date, to confirm when their child’s class is able to revert back to in-person learning,” the ADSB wrote. “This is not a school closure,” the board emphasized. “The move to remote/virtual learning is a precautionary measure made by the school board, not one that was ordered by the Health Unit.” “We regret any inconvenience this may cause, however, we do feel this precautionary decision is in the best interest of student and staff safety,” the ADSB wrote.",https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/sootoday/images/stock-images/20200526-adsb-summer-stock-dt-03.jpg;w=630,sootoday
Vancouver Canucks eager for return to home arena packed with fans,https://panow.com/2021/10/25/vancouver-canucks-eager-for-return-to-home-arena-packed-with-fans/,,,,VANCOUVER - The Vancouver Canucks have missed their fans.

It’s been nearly 600 days since the club has played a regular-season game in front of a home crowd, a stretch that’s set to end Tuesday when Vancouver hosts the Minnesota Wild. Goalie Thatcher Demko remembers the last time he and his teammates heard the cheers of a packed Rogers Arena. It was back on March 10, 2020 when the Canucks snatched a 5-4 shootout win over New York Islanders in front of an 18,871-strong crowd. “It’s crazy to think that we haven’t seen our fans in that long,” Demko said Monday. “I know everyone’s excited about it, we’ve been talking about it. We were getting a little itchy on the road there, wanting to get home and play some home games here.” Much has changed over the past 19 months. Fans in attendance Tuesday will be required to wear masks and show vaccine passports, ideas that sounded more like science fiction than everyday reality back in March 2020. For Demko, though, there’s one thread running through both games. “I was joking with my dad because he was at that (March 2020) game and he’s actually in town right now and I was like ‘Geeze, it’s been a long time. You were at the last game with friends and you’ll be at the one where we get them back, too.’ So that’s kind of cool,” the goalie said. While most NHL teams have already experienced the thrill of a home game this season, the Canucks (3-2-1) kicked off their campaign with a six-game road swing. They capped the trip with a 4-2 win over the Seattle Kraken on Saturday. “It’s not a lot of times that you start with a six-game trip and I like how we prevailed through it and got through it and played pretty well,” said Canucks head coach Travis Green. Saturday’s victory marked the first-ever home game for the Kraken, the NHL’s newest franchise. It was also the third home opener Vancouver has played this season. Each was an exciting game in a hostile environment, Demko said. “The fans are such a massive element to what we do on a nightly basis, whether we’re at home or on the road,” he said. It’s an element some players missed last season, when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the Canucks — and many other NHL teams — to play in empty arenas against the same teams again and again. Fans have a significant impact on games, said Vancouver centre Elias Pettersson. “It’s like an extra player almost,” he said. “Last year made me realize fans play a big part in just getting you going in a game. So the fans, they play a big part.” Last week, the B.C. government announced it was lifting capacity limits on indoor sporting events, starting Monday as the province’s new vaccine passport regulations came into effect. The move means the Canucks can have 100 per cent capacity for Tuesday’s home opener, though tickets were still available as of Monday afternoon. Having a full building will be exciting for the whole team, said coach Green. “Not only coming off a road trip, a long road trip here, you’re always excited to get home and play in front of fans,” he said. “It’s been so long. It’s going to be a lot of energy in our building.” The Canucks and Wild haven’t face one another since August 2020, when Vancouver beat Minnesota in a four-game series held in the NHL’s post-season “bubble” in Edmonton. The Wild (4-1-0) have looked strong early this season, winning four straight before dropping a 5-2 decision to the Nashville Predators on Sunday. The visitors will be hungry for a win, Green said. “(Tuesday’s) game is going to be a tough game. Minnesota’s got a lot of depth, they’ve got a lot of sides and they can skate,” he said. “They’re playing with some confidence and some swagger which you would be when you have a start like that.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published Oct. 25, 2021.

Across the country, universities are implementing various vaccination, masking and distancing policies; however, there's little evidence about the risk of the spread of COVID-19 at social gatherings among university students to guide schools' policies. A new analysis by a researcher at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), published in JAMA Network Open , finds a link between large gatherings of unvaccinated county residents—both students and non-students—and an increase in COVID-19 infections in the university's community. Ashley L. O'Donoghue, Ph.D., an economist at the Center for Healthcare Delivery Science and a research fellow in the Department of Medicine at BIDMC, looked at the new daily COVID-19 infections in counties with universities across the country from January to May of 2021. Next, she compared COVID-19 infection rates in counties with universities that participated in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) March Madness to those in counties with no link to the tournament. ""Counties that are home to universities that participated in NCAA March Madness saw a temporary increase in COVID-19 cases beginning eight days following the tournament and peaking 24 days after the tournament, relative to counties not involved in the tournament,"" said O'Donoghue. ""While many universities have decided to implement vaccination mandates, not all universities have. This study fills a gap in evidence on the risk of COVID-19 spread from social gatherings among unvaccinated university students . This suggests that vaccinations, surveillance testing of unvaccinated students, or other mitigation measures, are still important to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in a university's community."" O'Donoghue noted that universities participating in March Madness that were concerned about potential COVID-19 transmission may have increased surveillance testing during and after the tournament and thus documented more COVID-19 infections during this time than other counties. However, this study provides evidence that social gatherings among unvaccinated university students are associated with increased COVID-19 infections in a university's community, useful information for universities currently debating vaccination and/or surveillance testing policies for their campuses, O'Donoghue said.

Supporters of paid sick leave in B.C. advocate from Vancouver and Victoria,https://vancouver.citynews.ca/2021/10/24/vancouver-victoria-paid-sick-leave/,,['alylaube'],,People in Vancouver and Victoria who want B.C. to give workers 10 paid sick days took to the streets Monday to rally for action from the Horgan government.,"A so-called “COVID-safe Day of Action” is taking place Monday in Metro Vancouver and Victoria, with groups hoping to pressure the Horgan government to follow through with its plans to bring in mandatory paid sick leave for workers. Raj Khunkhun, VP with Community Savings Credit Union, says his organization is advocating for 10 paid sick days. “We’re lagging behind comparable countries like New Zealand and Australia. They already introduced 10 paid sick days. Germany actually has 30,” he said. “The federal government is poised to bring in 10 paid sick days for federally regulated workers, so we think B.C. should introduce 10 paid sick days as well.” Related Articles: B.C. seeks input on length of paid sick leave Some B.C. businesses still resistant to paid sick leave: CFIB Health-care workers demand Trudeau fast track paid sick-leave policy The Horgan government is expected to pass legislation before the end of the year to bring in paid sick leave, despite opposition from certain groups — including the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. But Khunkhun says having provincially-mandated paid sick days isn’t going to deter businesses. “We have always provided 12 paid sick days, but we provided a further 10 paid sick days during the pandemic, very early on, and also an additional six hours a week off just to get groceries because the line-ups were long,” said Khunkhun. They found there was no impact to their bottom line and had their most profitable year to-date. “We don’t want people to have to decide between getting paid fully and putting others at risk. We don’t think that should be a burden on the worker. They should also be able to take the time off, and that will also help our healthcare system, which is already really stressed right now,” added Khunkhun.",2021-10-25 00:59:19,,https://vancouver.citynews.ca/wp-content/blogs.dir/sites/9/2021/01/sneeze-1431371.jpg,citynews1130

BYU’s win over Wazzu a confidence-builder ahead of former coach Bronco Mendenhall coming to town,https://www.deseret.com/2021/10/24/22741210/byu-football-bronco-mendenhall-kalani-sitake-clark-barrington-brennan-armstrong-malik-moore,,['Jay Drew'],,,"BYU running back Tyler Allgeier, right, carries the ball while pressured by Washington State linebacker Jahad Woods during the second half of an NCAA college football game, Saturday, Oct. 23, 2021, in Pullman, Wash. | Young Kwak, Associated Press Having gone 4-0 against Pac-12 teams with the 21-19 win over Washington State, BYU turns its attention to one of the nation’s top offenses in explosive Virginia Offensive lineman Clark Barrington climbed onto the railing at Martin Stadium to salute the thousands of BYU fans who made the trip to the Palouse to watch their beloved Cougars play, including a couple dozen relatives and family friends. Defensive back Malik Moore joked after dropping a couple interceptions — easier to do after a win and one successful pick, no doubt — and bruising running back Tyler Allgeier said he was as sore as he’s ever been after a game. Thirty-two carries, including seven straight when everybody in the place knew the ball was going to BYU’s best player and he ran it down Wazzu’s throat anyway, will do that to a guy. “We knew that we would face adversity, and one thing we have been focusing on all week is getting through that adversity and staying up and helping each other out and pushing along. So that is what the vibe was in the locker room — that we are going to get through this, we are going to continue to drive the ball, our defense will do their best to get stops, and we will come out on top.” — BYU offensive lineman Clark Barrington For this resilient bunch of Cougars, Saturday’s 21-19 win over Washington State came as a relief as much as anything else. BYU became the only team in the country to beat four Pac-12 teams to date, but this victory was more about building its own confidence, after a two-game losing skid put BYU in what head coach Kalani Sitake called “a slump.” Imagine what Arizona coaches are calling their 19-game slide. Whatever the case, this is a win BYU desperately needed, what with Bronco Mendenhall and his 6-2 Virginia Cavaliers coming back to Provo this week for an 8:15 p.m. late-night special Saturday at LaVell Edwards Stadium. “Getting a win, it always boosts your confidence, and so it is nice to have another win,” said Barrington, the left guard who teamed with left tackle Blake Freeland to clear the way for Allgeier to pick up 9 yards on his final carry and secure the first down so BYU wouldn’t have to call on Spokane native Ryan Rehkow to pin WSU deep in the final minute. Added Moore, the ballhawking safety who invited social media followers after the game to needle him all they wanted for the drops — for one day: “I think for sure it picks up our confidence a lot, and shows us we are not out of it, we are no scrubs, you know?,” he said. “I think everybody’s chin was down, worrying about the last two games. This game really proved to us that we still got it, we are still a good team, we have won six games. Not a lot of teams are doing that, so we’re good.” In getting bowl eligible before Halloween — an unexpected development for a team that lost Zach Wilson and more than a dozen other key contributors — the Cougars are sort of playing with house money from here on out, with Virginia and USC looming as the only possible stumbling blocks to a 10-win season.

Credit defensive coordinator Ilaisa Tuiaki for designing a game plan that held Wazzu to 257 passing yards and 19 points. “We lost to a good team,” said WSU tackle Abraham Lucas. “We didn’t roll over, either. I think a lot of people nationwide and even (in Pullman) probably expected us to just roll over and die.” BYU didn’t. “I thought they had tons of energy,” Sitake said of the crimson Cougars. “It was a lot of fun. I feel really fortunate and happy that we got the win.” Allgeier, who is now seventh in the country in rushing yards (861) and sixth in rushing touchdowns (11), said another win in Pac-12 territory was just what the doctor ordered before what is sure to be an emotional game against Mendenhall and company. “I would say it brings the confidence back up,” Allgeier said. “We are 0-0 now, but we gotta keep that momentum going forward.” It won’t be easy against the Hoos, who beat Georgia Tech 48-40 on Saturday in Charlottesville and have won four straight behind the sensational quarterbacking of Brennan Armstrong. The 6-foot-2, 215-pound junior from Shelby, Ohio, leads the country in passing yards (3,220) and is second in passing yards per game (402.5). Virginia is fourth in the country in total offense, putting up 539.9 yards per game with former BYU offensive coordinator Robert Anae doing the play-calling. Defensively, though, the Hoos are below average. They are giving up 432.8 yards per game, which ranks them 105th in the country. They are especially susceptible to the run — ranking 113th in rushing defense. The Cougars enter Mendenhall’s homecoming a bit shorthanded, as starting center James Empey and starting receiver Gunner Romney left the WSU win with injuries and didn’t return. Sitake said both are “doubtful” to play this week. Right tackle Harris LaChance has been out for several weeks, but freshman Campbell Barrington has filled in admirably.

Pac-12 men’s basketball preview: Can league capitalize on record-setting NCAA Tournament performances?,https://www.deseret.com/2021/10/25/22732726/pac-12-basketball-preview-utah-utes-coach-craig-smith-commissioner-george-kliavkoff-jamie-zaninovich,,['Jay Drew'],,,"UCLA players celebrate after an Elite 8 game against Michigan at Lucas Oil Stadium, Wednesday, March 31, 2021, in Indianapolis. UCLA won 51-49. With all their key contributors returning this season, the Bruins are sure to be a tough out for the Utes and the other Pac-12 teams this season. | Darron Cummings, Associated Press New Runnin’ Utes coach Craig Smith enters a Pac-12 basketball race that is as deep and loaded as ever after impressive NCAA Tournament showing in 2021 SAN FRANCISCO — A razor-close overtime loss to undefeated Gonzaga in a Final Four game. Three teams in the Elite Eight. Four teams in the Sweet 16. Five teams in the Round of 32. A conference-record 13 total wins in the 2021 NCAA Tournament. Add it all up, and it begs the question: What will Pac-12 men’s basketball teams do for an encore in the 2022 Big Dance after the most successful overall showing in conference history last March? “We have great reasons for optimism in the Pac-12,” deputy commissioner and chief operating officer Jamie Zaninovich said at the league’s men’s basketball media day last week at conference headquarters in San Francisco. “The collective commitment to basketball throughout the conference is very important. Our shared objective is to optimize tournament bids and ultimately cut down the nets as national champions.” — Pac-12 commissioner George Kliavkoff The good news for the league is that many of the top players who helped turn the conference’s unexpected success into the story of March Madness last spring are back for more this year. Although only two Pac-12 teams made The Associated Press Top 25 preseason poll released Monday — UCLA is at No. 2 and Oregon is at No. 13 — the league is seemingly gaining more respect with each passing year. Arizona, USC and Colorado received votes, along with BYU, which will play two Pac-12 teams this year — Utah and Oregon. “We are excited about the momentum we have from last season, and confident in the talented student-athletes and great leadership from our coaches,” said new Pac-12 commissioner George Kliavkoff last week. “The collective commitment to basketball throughout the conference is very important. Our shared objective is to optimize tournament bids and ultimately cut down the nets as national champions.” That hasn’t been done since Lute Olson’s Arizona Wildcats won it all in 1997. Into that momentum, and improvement after some lackluster Big Dance showings from 2017-2019, steps new University of Utah coach Craig Smith. The only other new coach is Arizona’s Tommy Lloyd, the former top assistant under Mark Few at Gonzaga. “Certainly, being a part of this amazing conference — the Pac-12, the Conference of Champions, is what they say. Or at least somebody does. To be a part of that is awesome. It is something you want to be a part of, right?,” Smith said, flanked by returnees Branden Carlson and Riley Battin, when it was Utah’s turn to address the media on Oct. 13. “Bring on the competition.” Actually, the league has been trending up since 2020, when up to six teams were expected to get NCAA Tournament bids before the Big Dance was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But few saw the 2021 success coming. In retrospect, every team was probably under-seeded, from Final Four participant UCLA — which upset BYU in a first-round game — to surprise conference tournament champion Oregon State to USC, Colorado and Oregon (which was eliminated by another Pac-12 school, USC). “To finally see the Pac-12 in men’s basketball capture the attention of the basketball world, in March Madness, is truly remarkable and again, a testament to our student-athletes, coaches, administrators, everybody,” Zaninovich said. Some of the league’s NCAA Tournament failures in past years, or unimpressive showings in nonconference games, have been explained away by league officials as the conference having too many one-and-done players leaving early for the NBA. That didn’t happen this offseason, as preseason all-conference selections Johnny Juzang of UCLA, Warith Alatishe of Oregon State, Marcus Bagley of Arizona State and Isaiah Mobley of USC opted to return, “when they had pro opportunities in front of them, but chose to come back to school and invest in their collegiate experience,” Zaninovich said. As it were, the league produced three NBA lottery picks in 2021 — more than any other conference. Four all-freshman team players returned, and will be joined by 10 all-conference transfers, including MAC Player of the Year Marreon Jackson, the former Toledo star who is moving on to Arizona State. Zaninovich said four McDonald’s All-Americans will join the Pac-12 this year, and 12 players from ESPN’s Top 100 recruits list. Smith and Lloyd join a group of coaches who have more than 3,000 wins and 148 years of coaching experience. “The coaching in this league is obviously remarkable,” Zaninovich said. What else does the 2021-22 season hold for the Pac-12? Officials announced that the Pac-12 championship game at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas will tip off in prime time on the East Coast and will be televised by Fox. Also, the Pac-12 will host an NCAA Regional at the Chase Center in San Francisco — the first time in 80 years that San Francisco will host an NCAA Tournament game, the last one having been played at nearby Treasure Island. This will be the second season in which Pac-12 schools will play 20 conference games each. Before that, there will be some huge opportunities for Pac-12 teams to get big national wins. Stanford, Oregon and Arizona State will all get a shot at defending national champion Baylor; Washington and UCLA will play preseason AP No. 1 Gonzaga. Also, Oregon will play in the Maui Invitational and ASU will play in the Battle 4 Atlantis with opportunities to run across top-ranked teams in later rounds. Pac-12 teams will meet power-conference teams at least 20 times, including Utah’s Nov. 20 game against the ACC’s Boston College at the Sunshine Slam in Daytona Beach, Florida. The Runnin’ Utes will also face the SEC’s Missouri on Dec. 18 in Columbia, Missouri, the Big 12’s TCU on Dec. 8 in Fort Worth, Texas, and will host Big 12-bound BYU on Nov. 27 at the Huntsman Center in games that will either add to, or detract from, the league’s improved reputation as a national player. Zaninovich said the league has worked hard to help schools with their nonconference scheduling to figure out what makes the most sense for them. The goal is to have Pac-12 teams win at least 75% of their nonconference games. “We looked at tons of data of the NCAA Tournament, historically, and in most every case, if a conference wins 75% of its nonconference games, at least 50% of their teams advance to the NCAA Tournament,” Zaninovich said. Here’s a closer look at each team’s prospects in 2021-22, in order of how they were selected to finish in the preseason media poll: 1. UCLA Darron Cummings, Associated Press UCLA guard Tyger Campbell, right, celebrates with teammate guard Jaime Jaquez Jr. (4) after an Elite 8 game against Michigan in the NCAA men’s college basketball tournament at Lucas Oil Stadium, in Indianapolis on Wednesday, March 31, 2021. UCLA won 51-49. UCLA is an overwhelming favorite to win the Pac-12 after reaching the Final Four last season. All five starters and every other contributor to the Bruins’ Final Four run returned for coach Mick Cronin, making UCLA an easy pick to win the league. Starters such as Juzang, Tyger Campbell, Jules Bernard, Cody Riley and Jaime Jaquez Jr. will be joined by key newcomers Peyton Watson, Will McClendon and Rutgers transfer Myles Johnson to give the Bruins arguably the best team in the country. “Conference success in our sport is important because of NCAA Tournament bids,” Cronin said at media day. “We are all playing to go to the NCAA Tournament, and getting quality seeds. So conference power, success, all of it, is huge. … I think we proved last year that Pac-12 basketball is powerful.” Juzang and Jaquez said there’s a heightened sense of excitement in Westwood these days, thanks to that tournament run. “We are just as excited as them,” Juzang said. Cronin said the Bruins have “the greatest tradition” in the history of college basketball and feel more pressure to live up to that standard than to repeat last year’s run. 2. Oregon Jeff Roberson, Associated Press Oregon guard Will Richardson drives to the basket ahead of Southern California guard Drew Peterson during Sweet 16 game in the NCAA men’s college basketball tournament at Bankers Life Fieldhouse, Sunday, March 28, 2021, in Indianapolis. Richardson will be back for the Ducks in 2021-22, and is considered one of the better point guards in the league. The Ducks lost quality players Chris Duarte, LJ Figueroa and Eugene Omoruyi, but did well in the transfer portal market, landing Syracuse’s Quincy Guerrier, Oklahoma’s De’Vion Harmon and Jacob Young of Rutgers. They will join one of the Pac-12’s better returning point guards, Will Richardson, to give coach Dana Altman another league championship contender. Former American Fork star Isaac Johnson, a 7-footer, will join the program after having served a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints the past two years. Altman was asked at media day how much longer he will stay in coaching. “I don’t have anything else,” he said. “I am 63. I would like to go on as long as Oregon will have me. … I don’t know what I would do if I didn’t go to the gym every day.” 3. USC (AP Photo/Paul Sancya, Associated Press USC forward Evan Mobley (4) and USC forward Isaiah Mobley (3) watch from the bench during game against Kansas in the second round of the NCAA Tournament at Hinkle Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, Monday, March 22, 2021. While Evan has moved on to the NBA (the No. 3 overall pick in the 2021 NBA draft) Isaiah returns to the Trojans this season. A lot of experts say the Trojans will sorely miss Evan Mobley, the No. 3 pick in July’s NBA draft. They will. But they will also miss reliable guard Tahj Eaddy, the Santa Clara transfer who helped USC eliminate Utah 91-85 in double overtime in the Pac-12 quarterfinals last spring. Coach Andy Enfield does get back Mobley’s brother, Isaiah, and point guard Ethan Anderson and wings Isaiah White and Drew Peterson. Forwards Max Agbonkpolo and Chavez Goodwin also return, which is why USC should make the Big Dance again. “We have a lot of versatilely, but our guards have to be good for us if we hope to get back,” Enfield said.”… The excitement around our program is at an all-time high since I have been here the last eight seasons.” Memphis transfer Boogie Ellis brings his 10.2 scoring average to the team. The coach said the Pac-12’s showing in the tournament “gave our conference a tremendous boost. We were rooting for everyone else as if it were our own program.” T4. Arizona Jeff Chiu, Associated Press Arizona coach Tommy Lloyd waves while speaking during Pac-12 media day Wednesday, Oct. 13, 2021, in San Francisco. Lloyd and Utah’s Craig Smith are the two newcomer coaches to the league this season. Sure, the Wildcats have the winning tradition to fall back on, but this pick from media members who cover the Pac-12 seems high (the Deseret News picked Arizona ninth on its ballot). As mentioned previously, new coach Lloyd saw a lot of winning in more than 20 years at Gonzaga, but Ws don’t figure to come as easily in Tucson for awhile. “I might have to recalibrate what a good winning percentage feels like,” Lloyd said. “I am really looking forward to that journey where every game is going to be a battle.” Lloyd said at Gonzaga if they lost a West Coast Conference game, “it felt like you lost a seed line” for the NCAA Tournament. Bennedict Mathurin, Azuolas Tubelis and Kerr Kriisa stuck around after Sean Miller was fired, and Utah transfer Pelle Larsson should be able to step in and contribute immediately. “We have a great young nucleus to work with,” Lloyd said. T4. Oregon State Amanda Loman, Associated Press Oregon State’s Warith Alatishe shoots over Utah’s Riley Battin during game in Corvallis, Ore., Thursday, Feb. 18, 2021. Much to Oregon State coach Wayne Tinkle’s delight, Alatishe will be back for the Beavers. Before that magical three-weekend stretch in March when they won the Pac-12 Tournament and advanced to the Elite Eight, the Beavers were an average team, perhaps even less than that. Can they recapture that momentum? Coach Wayne Tinkle was able to keep most of his best players — most notably Alatishe, supreme shooter Jarod Lucas and backcourt mate Gianni Hunt. Replacing floor leader Ethan Thompson will be difficult. “This conference is going to be as deep as it has ever been,” Tinkle said, hinting that even though the Beavers have improved, the rest of the league has as well, and duplicating that run will be difficult. 6. Colorado Michael Conroy, Associated Press Colorado forward Evan Battey celebrates during a timeout against Georgetown in NCAA first-round game at Hinkle Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, Saturday, March 20, 2021. Battey will be back for the Buffs in 2021-22. Point guard McKinley Wright IV was a fixture in Boulder the past four years, and will be extremely hard to replace. But coach Tad Boyle said he likes this group, especially if a highly rated incoming freshman class contributes. The Buffs’ best returners are big man Evan Battey, forward Jabari Walker and guard Eli Parquet, who helped CU go 14-6 in league play and earn a No., 5 seed in the NCAA Tournament. Colorado reached the Round of 32 and was the only Pac-12 entrant that didn’t win two or more contests in March Madness. “We are in great shape leadership-wise, but we gotta grow up quickly,” Boyle said. 7. Arizona State Rick Scuteri, Associated Press Arizona State coach Bobby Hurley talks to Marcus Bagley during game against Arizona, Thursday, Jan. 21, 2021, in Tempe, Ariz. Convincing Bagley to return was a big win for the ASU coach. Coach Bobby Hurley scored two major wins in the offseason, getting talented forward Bagley to stick around for at least another year and luring MAC Player of the Year Marreon Jackson of Toledo to Tempe. Jackson, who averaged 18.1 points, 6.1 rebounds and 5.9 assists for the Rockets last year, will team with Ohio State transfer Luther Muhammad and Boston College transfer Jay Heath and returnees Bagley, Kimani Lawrence and Enoch Boakye to give Hurley plenty of talent with which to work. After ASU went 11-14 last year, 7-10 in the Pac-12, Hurley said watching fellow conference mates succeed in the tournament was invigorating. “I was so happy for the league, and for those colleagues, those coaches,” he said. Bagley, a 6-foot-8 sophomore, said his decision to return was “based on knowing how much better I could be.” 8. Washington State Pete Caster, Associated Press Washington State head coach Kyle Smith reacts after a foul was called during game against Stanford, Saturday, Feb. 20, 2021, in Pullman, Wash. Slowly but surely, Smith is bringing respectability to the Cougars program. The Cougars are a popular pick among some to make the NCAA Tournament for the first time in awhile, because coach Kyle Smith is slowly building something in Pullman. Wazzu returns its main rotation — led by Efe Abogidi, Dishon Jackson and Noah Williams — and should be bolstered by South Alabama transfer Michael Flowers (21.0 ppg.) and UC San Diego transfer Tyrell Roberts (19.2 ppg.), who joined Abogidi and Smith at media day. “He’s a bucket,” Smith said of the 5-11 Roberts. Having gone 7-12 in league play last year, the Cougars will hang their hat on defense once again, Smith said. “I think our talent is there,” he said. “Experience is still lacking, we are still quite youthful.” 9. Stanford David Zalubowski, Associated Press Stanford forward Jaiden Delaire, left, drives during game against Colorado Saturday, Jan. 16, 2021, in Boulder, Colo. Delaire will be among the Cardinal players trying to keep Stanford coach Jerod Haase on the sidelines this season. While Utah coach Larry Krystkowiak was clearly on the hot seat last year, and ended up losing his job, the Pac-12 coach who wears that description this year is Stanford’s Jerod Haase, along with Washington’s Mike Hopkins, perhaps. The Cardinal lost a lot, most notably Oscar da Silva, Zaire Williams and Daejon Davis, and will do well to make the tournament for the first time since 2014. Senior Jaiden Delaire, junior Spencer Jones and five-star recruit Harrison Ingram will attempt to help Haase keep his job. “Our goal is to simple — it is to be awesome,” Haase said. That might be what it takes to keep the sixth-year coach in Palo Alto for another year. 10. Utah Jeff Chiu, Associated Press Utah coach Craig Smith, left, speaks next to Riley Battin, middle, and Branden Carlson during Pac-12 media day Wednesday, Oct. 13, 2021, in San Francisco. While expectations for the Utes are not high in Smith’s first year at the helm, the players said at media day that the Utes will surprise some people in 2021-22. For the record, the Deseret News picked the Utes to finish seventh. The mass exodus since Krystkowiak was fired on March 16 has been well-documented, but Smith was able to keep Carlson and Battin in the fold (after Battin briefly entered the transfer portal) and those two said at media day that the Runnin’ Utes will surprise some people in 2021-22. “I will say this: We have gotten a lot better in a short amount of time, and I can’t wait to see where this team goes,” Smith said at media day. The feeling here is that UNLV grad transfer David Jenkins Jr. will give the Utes a nice scoring lift, and Utah State transfers Marco Anthony and Rollie Worster will add some defensive toughness that was lacking last year. “There is a lot of depth in our backcourt,” Smith said. “The words that describe our backcourt are selfless and skilled. They can shoot it, they can pass it, they can dribble it, and for the most part we are pretty tough defensively with a good feel for the game.” 11. Washington Ted S. Warren, Associated Press California guard Jarred Hyder (3) is defended by Washington forward Nate Roberts (1) as guards Jamal Bey (5) and Marcus Tsohonis (0) watch during game Saturday, Feb. 20, 2021, in Seattle. The Huskies went 15-3 in Pac-12 play in 2018-19, but have been a disaster since then, going 9-29 in league play since. The aforementioned Hopkins seemingly needs a big turnaround to keep his job. Starters Jamal Bey and Nate Roberts return, but most of the other expected contributors are transfers — guys such as Terrell Brown Jr. (Arizona), Daejon Davis (Stanford) and Emmitt Mathews Jr. (West Virginia). “We took advantage of the transfer portal,” Hopkins said. 12. California Jeff Chiu, Associated Press California forward Andre Kelly shoots against Oregon during game in Berkeley, Calif., Saturday, Feb. 27, 2021. Kelly is the Bears’ leading returning scorer. Coach Mark Fox’s best player last year, former Wasatch Academy star Matt Bradley, has transferred to San Diego State. He will be missed. Andre Kelly (10.3 ppg.) and Grant Anticevich (8.9 ppg.) are back, and are joined by Charlotte transfer Jordan Shepherd. The Bears will play at UNLV on Nov. 13 in what should be a barometer game; they will also play Florida in the Rocket Mortgage Fort Myers Tip-Off and either Ohio State or Seton Hall in the second round. “We have a nonconference schedule that is going to help us play in the best conference in America,” Fox said.",2021-10-25 16:15:22,"SAN FRANCISCO — A razor-close overtime loss to undefeated Gonzaga in a Final Four game. Three teams in the Elite Eight. Four teams in the Sweet 16. Five teams in the Round of 32. A conference-record 13 total wins in the 2021 NCAA Tournament. Add it all up, and it begs the question: What will Pac-12 men’s basketball teams do for an encore in the 2022 Big Dance after the most successful overall showing in conference history last March? “We have great reasons for optimism in the Pac-12,” deputy commissioner and chief operating officer Jamie Zaninovich said at the league’s men’s basketball media day last week at conference headquarters in San Francisco. “The collective commitment to basketball throughout the conference is very important. Our shared objective is to optimize tournament bids and ultimately cut down the nets as national champions.” — Pac-12 commissioner George Kliavkoff The good news for the league is that many of the top players who helped turn the conference’s unexpected success into the story of March Madness last spring are back for more this year. Although only two Pac-12 teams made The Associated Press Top 25 preseason poll released Monday — UCLA is at No. 2 and Oregon is at No. 13 — the league is seemingly gaining more respect with each passing year. Arizona, USC and Colorado received votes , along with BYU, which will play two Pac-12 teams this year — Utah and Oregon. “We are excited about the momentum we have from last season, and confident in the talented student-athletes and great leadership from our coaches,” said new Pac-12 commissioner George Kliavkoff last week. “The collective commitment to basketball throughout the conference is very important. Our shared objective is to optimize tournament bids and ultimately cut down the nets as national champions.” That hasn’t been done since Lute Olson’s Arizona Wildcats won it all in 1997. Into that momentum, and improvement after some lackluster Big Dance showings from 2017-2019, steps new University of Utah coach Craig Smith . The only other new coach is Arizona’s Tommy Lloyd, the former top assistant under Mark Few at Gonzaga. “Certainly, being a part of this amazing conference — the Pac-12, the Conference of Champions, is what they say. Or at least somebody does. To be a part of that is awesome. It is something you want to be a part of, right?,” Smith said, flanked by returnees Branden Carlson and Riley Battin , when it was Utah’s turn to address the media on Oct. 13. “Bring on the competition.” Actually, the league has been trending up since 2020, when up to six teams were expected to get NCAA Tournament bids before the Big Dance was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Related How will new Runnin’ Utes coach Craig Smith fare in the Pac-12? Some experts weigh in But few saw the 2021 success coming. In retrospect, every team was probably under-seeded, from Final Four participant UCLA — which upset BYU in a first-round game — to surprise conference tournament champion Oregon State to USC, Colorado and Oregon (which was eliminated by another Pac-12 school, USC). “To finally see the Pac-12 in men’s basketball capture the attention of the basketball world, in March Madness, is truly remarkable and again, a testament to our student-athletes, coaches, administrators, everybody,” Zaninovich said. Some of the league’s NCAA Tournament failures in past years, or unimpressive showings in nonconference games, have been explained away by league officials as the conference having too many one-and-done players leaving early for the NBA. That didn’t happen this offseason, as preseason all-conference selections Johnny Juzang of UCLA, Warith Alatishe of Oregon State, Marcus Bagley of Arizona State and Isaiah Mobley of USC opted to return, “when they had pro opportunities in front of them, but chose to come back to school and invest in their collegiate experience,” Zaninovich said. As it were, the league produced three NBA lottery picks in 2021 — more than any other conference. Four all-freshman team players returned, and will be joined by 10 all-conference transfers, including MAC Player of the Year Marreon Jackson, the former Toledo star who is moving on to Arizona State. Zaninovich said four McDonald’s All-Americans will join the Pac-12 this year, and 12 players from ESPN’s Top 100 recruits list. Smith and Lloyd join a group of coaches who have more than 3,000 wins and 148 years of coaching experience. Related Runnin’ Utes unfazed by being picked so low in suddenly deep Pac-12 “The coaching in this league is obviously remarkable,” Zaninovich said. What else does the 2021-22 season hold for the Pac-12? Officials announced that the Pac-12 championship game at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas will tip off in prime time on the East Coast and will be televised by Fox. Also, the Pac-12 will host an NCAA Regional at the Chase Center in San Francisco — the first time in 80 years that San Francisco will host an NCAA Tournament game, the last one having been played at nearby Treasure Island. This will be the second season in which Pac-12 schools will play 20 conference games each. Before that, there will be some huge opportunities for Pac-12 teams to get big national wins. Stanford, Oregon and Arizona State will all get a shot at defending national champion Baylor; Washington and UCLA will play preseason AP No. 1 Gonzaga. Also, Oregon will play in the Maui Invitational and ASU will play in the Battle 4 Atlantis with opportunities to run across top-ranked teams in later rounds. Pac-12 teams will meet power-conference teams at least 20 times, including Utah’s Nov. 20 game against the ACC’s Boston College at the Sunshine Slam in Daytona Beach, Florida. The Runnin’ Utes will also face the SEC’s Missouri on Dec. 18 in Columbia, Missouri, the Big 12’s TCU on Dec. 8 in Fort Worth, Texas, and will host Big 12-bound BYU on Nov. 27 at the Huntsman Center in games that will either add to, or detract from, the league’s improved reputation as a national player. Zaninovich said the league has worked hard to help schools with their nonconference scheduling to figure out what makes the most sense for them.

Picture: @SavannaCider/Twitter Savanna Cider Distell Group Email Print Tweet Share Matuba Mahlatjie | 13 hours ago JOHANNESBURG - Savanna drinkers won’t be left high and dry this coming festive season after some alcohol outlets confirmed that there was a shortage of the popular alcoholic beverage . The makers of the popular cider said that production had not stopped but that it had been slowed down by a global glass shortage exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. “We want to start by apologising and reassuring South Africans that millions of litres of your favourite cider is still being produced each week and allocated to local retailers to make sure that you do not miss your favourite crisp and dry cider, over the festive season. We are sorry for the low stock levels in stores but we are trying to keep up with you,” Eugene Lenford, marketing manager for the Savanna Cider said in a statement. The statement also said that shipping delays had also been impacted by the pandemic which had left a number of suppliers and producers on the back foot in the last twelve months. While makers of South Africa’s premium cider were apologetic for the shortage, they were also celebrating the growing demand for their product. “The demand for Savanna's range of premium ciders has exceeded supply for an extended period, but the premium cider producer is investing in additional capacity and working on a number of short, medium and long-term solutions to remedy this with glass and other suppliers to avoid future shortages.” Savanna drinkers have also been urged not to buy in bulk as plans are in place to recover and ensure a steady supply: “Savanna Premium Cider will continue to be available over the festive season in greater volumes than in previous years. We urge South Africans to be patient and are encouraged not to buy in bulk and to continue to only consume alcohol safely and responsibly,” the statement said.

Win McNamee/Getty Images hide caption A nurse draw a Moderna COVID-19 vaccine dose from a vial at the Cameron Grove Community Center in Bowie, Md., in late March. Moderna says study data supports use of a half-dose of the vaccine in children 6 to 11. Moderna says a study in kids 6 to 11 found two doses of the company's COVID-19 vaccine given 28 days apart produced a strong antibody response. The study, conducted in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health, used shots containing a 50 microgram dose of the vaccine, half the dose of the Moderna shots authorized for adults. More than 4,700 children ages 5 to 11 took part in the study. The most common side effects were fatigue, headache, fever and pain at the site of injection. The company says the analysis showed a ""favorable safety profile."" The summary of the study results was made available in a press release . The information hasn't been peer reviewed or published, but Moderna said it plans to submit them to a scientific journal for publication. The company also said it plans to submit the data to regulators, a move that would support the authorization of the vaccine for kids 6 to 11. The release of the data comes a day before a panel of advisers to the Food and Drug Administration will review use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in children 5 to 11 years of age. In June, Moderna submitted study results involving nearly 2,500 adolescents ages 12 to 15 to the FDA. The agency hasn't yet issued a decision on whether to expand use of the Moderna vaccine to that age group. In May, the FDA expanded authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to include adolescents 12 to 15 years of age.",,npr

Additionally, he noted he doesn't cut his 'impressive mullet' until after 'Survivor' Season 42.","Fans following Survivor Season 41 can’t help but notice more than a few changes. In addition to the many new twists and turns added into the game, Survivor host Jeff Probst is also sporting a new look. He spoke in an interview regarding the longer hairstyle he’s sporting in the new season — and he noted it doesn’t change until the end of Survivor Season 42. Here’s what Probst had to say. ‘Survivor’ Season 41 follows intense coronavirus protocol Jeff Probst on ‘Survivor’ Season 41 | Robert Voets/CBS via Getty Images Host Jeff Probst promised Survivor Season 41 would be unlike any other season the show’s had so far. While past seasons had contestants playing the game for 39 days, the new coronavirus (COVID-19) protocol had season 41 contestants playing for only 26 days. Because of the shorter gameplay, Probst promised more twists, more turns, and tougher gameplay than ever before. “Survivor 41 will birth a new era of Survivor with a faster, more dangerous, and much more intense game,” Probst said, according to Parade. “We really leaned into having fun with this season and the best kind of Survivor fun is the dangerous kind.” The show followed additional coronavirus protocol as well to ensure the safety of the contestants and the production team. “We worked with the Fiji government to create what was essentially a large bubble that consisted of several islands — including tribe camps, challenge locations, Tribal Council, and base camp,” Probst explained to Entertainment Weekly. “This extended bubble would be our home for the next many months. Once every crew member and player had quarantined for 14 days and received a negative test, we were able to move freely between those islands, with no risk, because it was only our crew and we were all safe.” Jeff Probst said he doesn’t cut his hair until the end of ‘Survivor’ Season 42 I am thrilled to tell you all that @survivorcbs is going back into production and I will see you on the island for #Survivor 41! @CBS pic.twitter.com/RtQGVFoDDL— Jeff Probst (@JeffProbst) March 22, 2021 Viewers watching Survivor Season 41 noticed Jeff Probst’s long hair. And he’s well-aware of his new style as well. “[My] hair is longer because like so many of us, I didn’t get it cut during COVID,” Probst told Entertainment Weekly. “And as it grew, I was reminded how grateful I am to still have hair, so why not grow it! And then I decided to keep it.” Fans should get used to his long hair, too. Probst told Entertainment Weekly he wasn’t able to chop his hair until the end of Survivor Season 42. “On location, there was no way to cut it anyway, so by the end of Survivor 42, I have a pretty damn impressive mullet!” he added. Probst’s long hair goes along with his “Survivor Guy” persona, too. Probst noted he gets into this persona prior to daily challenges. “Weirdly, he looked a lot like me, only significantly cooler,” Probst explained to Entertainment Weekly regarding “Survivor Guy.” “He wore animal skins, had much longer hair, a lot of odd tattoos and a feather necklace. I’ll never forget his first words to me: “Jeff, I am Survivor Guy … I am your alter ego, and if you embrace what I have to offer I can make your life on Survivor better than ever.” When is ‘Survivor’ Season 42? Jeff Probst | Robert Voets/CBS via Getty Images While Survivor Season 41 feels as if it’s just begun, when is Survivor Season 42? According to Premiere Date, fans can expect season 42 to premiere on CBS in Spring 2022. Initial reports regarding the 42nd season noted production experienced delays. In April 2021, Fiji reportedly suspended international passenger flights. This allegedly affected the filming for season 42. It seems production was able to make up for any delays, though — and that could be, in part, due to the new 26-day gameplay. According to Jeff Probst, the show will continue with its new format changes for the foreseeable future. Hopefully, fans can continue to embrace the change. Check out Showbiz Cheat Sheet on Facebook!

Credit: WMOBy Claudia Sadoff and Joachim von BraunWASHINGTON DC, Oct 25 2021 (IPS) The global food system is facing more demands from society than ever before in modern times – and rightly so. From responding to the climate crisis to dealing with rising malnutrition and ensuring the sustainable use of natural resources and protection of biodiversity, the responsibility of our food systems is no longer just to “feed the world.” The recent action agenda released by the UN Secretary General at the Food Systems Summit not only highlighted this urgency but reminded us that our food systems are also one of our greatest hopes for making progress on these fronts. While the US$10 billion pledged by the United States to end hunger and malnutrition is a welcome start, our food systems have been forced to cope with an increasingly complex, interconnected set of challenges for too long – often without a corresponding shift in focus from governments and other key players. The changes required also need sufficient funding for food systems transformation, estimated to be in the range of $400 billion per year. This goal is within reach and is roughly comparable to three times New York City’s annual budget or less than 0.5 percent of world GDP in 2020. Food systems transformation also requires impactful innovations, so particular importance in this funding should therefore be placed on investment in research and innovation. Increased and sustained funding for research and innovation is crucial, as the world requires technological, policy and institutional innovation to address the increasingly complex set of challenges that are facing, and threatening, food, land and water systems in a climate crisis. Investments in agricultural research and innovation generate significant returns. Benefit-cost ratios of CGIAR research, for example, have shown consistent returns on investments to the order of 10:1. Despite this, international agricultural research remains underfunded, threatening food, economic, and environmental security around the world, whilst hunger and poverty continue to rise. In addition to securing funding for research and innovation, research itself must evolve to address the growing challenges around the world. In particular, research efforts should favour more circular business models that are driven by value, rather than volume, and those that promote resilience to shocks and balance with nature over more environmentally damaging models. We must also ensure that more research translates into concrete innovations that truly advance food systems transformation. While we desperately need technological innovations to increase productivity, reduce poverty, hunger and malnutrition, as well as climate proofing our food systems and making them more equitable, such innovations can only be taken forward if they are bundled with appropriate national policies, institutional changes and global actions, and strategies to deal with shocks and conflict. Sometimes the implementation of innovations inevitably involves trade-offs, not only synergies. Research and innovation efforts will be crucial to understanding and managing such trade-offs, as well as to help ensure that interconnected challenges are tackled in the most efficient and holistic way. To both achieve and maximize the potential of research and innovation, governments of the world should consider allocating just one per cent of the portion of their national GDP that relates to food systems, towards research and innovation. At present, many countries, including many of the world’s richest, only spend half of this. For the least developed countries, aid will be needed to reach such a level, potentially through a special trust fund backed by the International Monetary Fund’s Special Drawing Rights (SDRs). Such a fund, when properly backed by developed countries, would help to support greater scientific capacity on the ground in low- and middle-income countries, which will be needed if we are to address the challenges facing the whole world, not just the developed world. Today’s agri-food systems no longer simply feed people. They must also provide nutrition, promote livelihoods, protect the environment, and tackle climate change – often all at once. Financing and unlocking innovations are needed to address these challenges together. If our food, land and water systems are ever able to achieve society’s mounting demands, we must ensure our priorities are in order and begin to properly finance them. Ultimately, all of the ambition generated around the UN Food Systems Summit will fall short if we fail to finance the new research and innovation we know we need.

‘Curb Your Enthusiasm’: Larry David’s Biggest Annoyance in Premiere Was This Aspect of COVID-19,https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/curb-your-enthusiasm-larry-davids-biggest-annoyance-in-premiere-was-this-aspect-of-covid-19.html/,"['comedy', 'HBO', 'HBO Max']",['Whitney Danhauer'],,'Curb Your Enthusiasm' Season 11 shows us all that even though Larry David may have reveled in a pandemic lockdown there was something else that he found much more offensive.,"Curb Your Enthusiasm premiered on HBO Sunday, Oct. 24, and fans of the show were ready. We haven’t seen our favorite characters in the world of Larry David, who plays himself, since March of 2020. Honestly, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic seems like something Larry has a lot of opinions about. Surprisingly, the show didn’t go the route most people were expecting. [SPOILER ALERT: This article contains spoilers about the premiere episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm Season 11.] Larry David | Photograph by John P. Johnson/ HBO Larry David mainly was annoyed with the ‘COVID hoarders’ in the ‘Curb Your Enthusiasm’ premiere The premiere episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm Season 11 opens up with Larry finding a dead body floating in his pool. After conversing with the police, it turns out that Larry’s fence isn’t up to code. He could actually be liable for the death of the person robbing his house. However, while fans may have thought this would be the show’s focus, the episode managed to intertwine several plots into the premiere. At a meeting, Larry offers a colleague some Purell. He quickly makes it clear that he’s not one of those “COVID hoarders.” He’s talking about the people who bought large amounts of hand sanitizer and toilet paper at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic and caused a shortage in several areas.  Later in the episode, Larry discovers one of his good friends, Albert Brooks, is a “COVID hoarder.” He announces it to the huge crowd of people gathered at Albert’s house. Like a mob with pitchforks, the group turned on him. The rest of the scene plays out as Larry smugly shrugs from the bottom of the stairs, and Albert screams out, “Come back! I have flu shots!” No one saunters back into our lives quite like Lawrence Gene David. pic.twitter.com/NndmQho00n— HBO (@HBO) October 24, 2021 RELATED: ‘Curb Your Enthusiasm’: Is Leon Larry David’s Imaginary Friend? J.B. Smoove Weighs In On Their Relationship ‘Curb Your Enthusiasm’ cashes in on the tiniest nuances that irritate most people If finding awkward situations as humorous isn’t your thing, there’s a good chance you aren’t a fan of Larry David and Curb Your Enthusiasm. However, it’s the reality of his irritation that draws most people in. Whether we want to admit it or not, we all get annoyed by situations similar to the ones Larry experiences in the series. From someone holding up a line at the local ice cream parlor by trying too many samples to becoming annoyed with a friend for holding a “live funeral” so he can hear all the good things people would say about him before he dies – these are all moments, many of us would inwardly groan at. The difference between Larry and most of us is that Larry has no issues pointing these out. Sure, he can come across as a jerk. However, most of the time, there’s a little tapping in the back of your brain that makes you realize, “Well, yeah, he kind of has a point…” RELATED: ‘Curb Your Enthusiasm’: How Bob Einstein’s Marty Funkhouser Stayed a Part of the Show in Season 10 Larry David’s disdain for people plays out in the most delightful way One would think that Larry would revel in a pandemic lockdown with his hatred of people and all, but the premiere episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm Season 11 doesn’t mention it. To be fair, in the trailer for this season, we hear him tell someone, “I hate people individually, but I love mankind.” He may be a little cranky, he may be narcissistic, but he’s definitely the funniest person on TV right now.

""The reason for discontinuation of the administration of the vaccine is being done out of an abundance of caution that men who received Sputnik V may be at higher risk of contracting HIV when exposed to it,"" said the ministry.",,2021-10-24 16:00:00,,,manilatimes

SYDNEY, Oct 25 — Australian officials plan to roll out Covid-19 booster shots soon to prevent a resurgence of cases, as residents in the two largest cities of Sydney and Melbourne begin to enjoy more freedoms after months-long curbs.Australia has ditched its Covid-zero strategy in favour of suppressing the coronavirus, after largely stamping out infections for most of this year, and is now aiming to live with the virus through higher vaccinations.Officials are gradually shifting their focus to booster shots as double-dose vaccinations levels in Australia’s adult population nears 75 per cent. Almost 87 per cent of people above 16 have received their first dose since the national rollout began in February.“We think what is going to happen is that a booster shot will be made available from six months from your second dose,” Lieutenant General John Frewen, head of the vaccination taskforce, told the Australian Broadcasting Corp on Monday.Advice from the country’s immunisation advisory group on booster shots “is imminent”, he said, adding health workers, and staff and residents in aged care and disability centres would be offered the doses in the initial phase.Amid a surge in vaccinations, Victoria on Monday logged its lowest rise in daily infections in nearly three weeks at 1,461, while cases dipped for the fourth straight day in neighbouring New South Wales (NSW) to 294.Officials in Victoria are looking to ease more restrictions on gatherings and movement on Friday, just a week after Melbourne, the state capital, exited its sixth lockdown during the pandemic. Sydney lifted its lockdown two weeks ago.Double-dose vaccination rates in Victoria’s adult population will top 80 per cent by then — a level where masks will not be mandatory outdoors and people free to travel throughout the state.That rate neared 85 per cent in NSW, home to Sydney, with the state tipped to hit 90 per cent next week. The next set of restrictions will be eased on Dec. 1, when the lockdown rules will lift for the unvaccinated, according to the state’s reopening plan. — Reuters",2021-10-25 00:56:41,,,malaymail

She recognizes the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, but said she also understands her son is at a much lower risk for serious illness than older adults. “To me it’s not a clear benefit,” she said. Read more: ‘No middle ground’: How children’s COVID-19 vaccination is polarizing parents While many parents were overjoyed at the news that Health Canada is considering approval of the first COVID-19 vaccine for kids age five to 11 in Canada, parents like Hubert are feeling more trepidatious, and public health officials said they are going to have a much more nuanced conversation with parents about vaccination than they did with adults. Story continues below advertisement While 82 per cent of eligible Canadians aged 12 and up are already fully vaccinated, a recent survey by Angus Reid shows only 51 per cent of parents plan to immediately vaccinate their kids when a pediatric dose becomes available. Of parents with children in the five to 11 year age range, 23 per cent said they would never give their kids a COVID-19 vaccine, 18 per cent said they would wait, and nine per cent said they weren’t sure, according to the survey of 5,011 Canadians between Sept. 29 and Oct. 3, which cannot be assigned a margin of error because online surveys are not considered random samples. “Most of the research that I’ve seen sort of indicates that parents are more hesitant to vaccinate their kids against COVID than themselves,” said Kate Allen, a post-doctoral fellow at the Center for Vaccine Preventable Diseases of the University of Toronto. 2:18 Pfizer asks Health Canada to approve vaccine for kids aged 5 to 11 Pfizer asks Health Canada to approve vaccine for kids aged 5 to 11 There are several reasons parents might pause, she said. Story continues below advertisement It’s true that children are at a much lower risk of serious outcomes associated with COVID-19, and there have been very rare incidents of mRNA vaccines like Pfizer or Moderna linked to cases of myocarditis, a swelling of the heart muscle. As of Oct. 1, Health Canada has documented 859 cases associated with the vaccines, which mainly seem to affect people under 40 years old, and people who’ve developed the complication have typically been fine. “I know it’s rare, I know it’s not deadly, but I also see the risk of severe symptoms from COVID as being rare and not deadly for Jackson,” Hubert said when asked about weighing up the risks and benefits of the vaccine. Read more: Canada getting 2.9M COVID-19 shots for kids ‘shortly’ after approval But public health experts stress that some children do suffer from rare but serious impacts from COVID-19, which can also cause myocarditis as well as the little-understood impacts of the condition known as long COVID. They say parents should consider the less tangible benefits of vaccination as well. “It’s less of a conversation about a direct benefit to them, and more of a community benefit,” Allen said. The pandemic has taken a heavy toll on children, depriving them of school, time with their peers, extracurriculars _ and their mental health has suffered as a result, said Dr. Vinita Dubey, associate medical officer of health with Toronto Public Health. Story continues below advertisement “Not one child has been spared from this pandemic. I mean every single child has had to bear a sacrifice because of the pandemic in one way or the other,” Dubey said. 2:04 Half of Canadian parents with children aged 5-11 want them to be fully vaccinated Half of Canadian parents with children aged 5-11 want them to be fully vaccinated So far Pfizer-BioNtech is the only manufacturer to request approval for its pediatric COVID-19 vaccine and Health Canada is still reviewing the data. The regulator has promised the review will be thorough, and the vaccine will only be approved for children if the benefits outweigh the potential risks. Policy-makers know they’re going to have to take parents’ concerns seriously as well. On a recent tour of the Childrens’ Hospital of Eastern Ontario in Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with Dr. Anne Pham-Huy, a pediatric infectious diseases physician. Story continues below advertisement “Vaccine confidence is going to be the most important part of it this time around,” Pham-Huy said, to which Trudeau agreed. Dubey has published research on improving parents’ vaccine confidence when it comes to long-established inoculations like mumps and rubella. 2:35 Ontario gets ready to roll out COVID-19 vaccine for children once approved Ontario gets ready to roll out COVID-19 vaccine for children once approved While she offered several tips, they mainly come down to building trust. Her research focused on the role of family doctors, but she said during the pandemic anyone can be that trusted sounding board. “It could be a faith leader, it could be an important family member or friend, someone who you trust, to help guide you to the right sources to make that decision,” she said. Read more: U.S. FDA says Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine is safe, effective for kids aged 5-11 Story continues below advertisement With that in mind, several students from across North America launched a peer-to-peer education program called Students for Herd Immunity to allow kids to have those conversations among themselves. The public health experts agree, the debate around vaccines has become polarized and open conversations will be the key to addressing parents’ concerns. “I think one thing to say to parents is you don’t have to make your decision right away,” Dubey said. “I mean for those who are ready to make their decision, but it’s fine but if you have questions, seek the answers.” Her only advice is to get those answers from a trusted source, and not social media.

Gottlieb says kids could start getting COVID vaccine as soon as November 4,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-vaccine-kids-ages-5-11-november-gottlieb-face-the-nation/,,,,Gottlieb said the Biden administration is making the effort to push the vaccine directly into pediatricians' offices.,,2021-10-25 19:45:44,"Former FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb predicted Sunday on ""Face the Nation"" that the Biden administration could begin rolling out COVID-19 vaccines for children as soon as November 4 or 5, right after a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention panel will decide whether to allow Pfizer's vaccine for children ages 5 to 11. Gottlieb said the Biden administration is making the effort to push the vaccine directly into pediatricians' offices. Pfizer, which Gottlieb sits on the board, is developing a small tray that carries 10 vials at a time and a storage container that is small enough for small to medium-sized pediatrician's office to stock the vaccine and deliver it. Transcript: Dr. Scott Gottlieb on ""Face the Nation"", October 24, 2021 ""It could be stored in a regular refrigerator for up to 10 weeks. It was purposely packaged that way,"" Gottlieb said. ""And so, the idea is to try to get it into pediatrician's offices because we know that getting children vaccinated is a much more consultative endeavor."" Gottlieb said many parents may not want to drag their children into a mass vaccination site or pharmacy and would rather have their children in the comfort of their own pediatrician's office. Dr. Scott Gottlieb on ""Face the Nation"" on October 24, 2021. CBS News Pfizer and BioNTech asked the FDA to authorize the vaccine for children 5 to 11 in early October. On Friday, scientists at the FDA said that the likely benefits of giving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine to 5- to 11-year-olds far outweigh the potential risks, such as heart inflammation. On Tuesday, the FDA's advisory panel will meet to review the data and evidence of the vaccine's safety and effectiveness in children, and vote on whether the FDA should authorize the use. ""If Pfizer does get the authorization on Tuesday from FDA, even before the CDC votes on this on November 2 and 3, they'll start to ship it into the supply chain so it will be available for use once there is a hopefully positive vote from CDC, said Gottlieb. So, it could be as early as November 4 and 5 that you can go into some locations and get your child vaccinated,"" he said. Although kids are at a lower risk of having a severe outcome due to contracting the virus, many have been hospitalized. According to the CDC , at least 731 children have died from COVID-19, including 160 deaths in the 5- to 11-year-old age range. Coronavirus Crisis More Can I get a booster shot?

Africa tries to end vaccine inequity by replicating its own,https://www.burnabynow.com/coronavirus-covid-19-national-news/africa-tries-to-end-vaccine-inequity-by-replicating-its-own-4545421,,,,"CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — In a pair of Cape Town warehouses converted into a maze of airlocked sterile rooms, young scientists are assembling and calibrating the equipment needed to reverse engineer a coronavirus vaccine that has yet to reach So",,2021-10-24 12:23:16,"CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — In a pair of Cape Town warehouses converted into a maze of airlocked sterile rooms, young scientists are assembling and calibrating the equipment needed to reverse engineer a coronavirus vaccine that has yet to reach South Africa and most of the world's poorest people. The energy in the gleaming labs matches the urgency of their mission to narrow vaccine disparities. By working to replicate Moderna's COVID-19 shot, the scientists are effectively making an end run around an industry that has vastly prioritized rich countries over poor in both sales and manufacturing. And they are doing it with unusual backing from the World Health Organization, which is coordinating a vaccine research, training and production hub in South Africa along with a related supply chain for critical raw materials. It's a last-resort effort to make doses for people going without, and the intellectual property implications are still murky. “We are doing this for Africa at this moment, and that drives us,” said Emile Hendricks, a 22-year-old biotechnologist for Afrigen Biologics and Vaccines, the company trying to reproduce the Moderna shot. ""We can no longer rely on these big superpowers to come in and save us.” Some experts see reverse engineering — recreating vaccines from fragments of publicly available information — as one of the few remaining ways to redress the power imbalances of the pandemic . Only 0.7% of vaccines have gone to low-income countries so far, while nearly half have gone to wealthy countries, according to an analysis by the People's Vaccine Alliance. That WHO, which relies upon the goodwill of wealthy countries and the pharmaceutical industry for its continued existence, is leading the attempt to reproduce a proprietary vaccine demonstrates the depths of the supply disparities. The U.N.-backed effort to even out global vaccine distribution, known as COVAX, has failed to alleviate dire shortages in poor countries. Donated doses are coming in at a fraction of what is needed to fill the gap. Meanwhile, pressure for drug companies to share, including Biden administration demands on Moderna, has led nowhere. Until now, WHO has never directly taken part in replicating a novel vaccine for current global use over the objections of the original developers. The Cape Town hub is intended to expand access to the novel messenger RNA technology that Moderna, as well as Pfizer and German partner BioNTech, used in their vaccines. “This is the first time we’re doing it to this level, because of the urgency and also because of the novelty of this technology,” said Martin Friede, a WHO vaccine research coordinator who is helping direct the hub. Dr. Tom Frieden, the former head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has described the world as “being held hostage” by Moderna and Pfizer, whose vaccines are considered the most effective against COVID-19. The novel mRNA process uses the genetic code for the spike protein of the coronavirus and is thought to trigger a better immune response than traditional vaccines. Arguing that American taxpayers largely funded Moderna's vaccine development, the Biden administration has insisted the company must expand production to help supply developing nations. The global shortfall through 2022 is estimated at 500 million and 4 billion doses, depending on how many other vaccines come on the market. “The United States government has played a very substantial role in making Moderna the company it is,” said David Kessler, the head of Operation Warp Speed, the U.S. program to accelerate COVID-19 vaccine development. Kessler would not say how far the administration would go in pressing the company. “They understand what we expect to happen,” he said. Moderna has pledged to build a vaccine factory in Africa at some point in the future. But after pleading with drugmakers to share their recipes, raw materials and technological know-how, some poorer countries are done waiting. Afrigen Managing Director Petro Terblanche said the Cape Town company is aiming to have a version of the Moderna vaccine ready for testing in people within a year and scaled up for commercial production not long after. “We have a lot of competition coming from Big Pharma. They don’t want to see us succeed,"" Terblanche said. ""They are already starting to say that we don’t have the capability to do this. We are going to show them.” If the team in South Africa succeeds in making a version of Moderna’s vaccine, the information will be publicly released for use by others, Terblanche said. Such sharing is closer to an approach U.S. President Joe Biden championed in the spring and the pharmaceutical industry strongly opposes. Commercial production is the point at which intellectual property could become an issue. Moderna has said it would not pursue legal action against a company for infringing on its vaccine rights, but neither has it offered to help companies that have volunteered to make its mRNA shot. Chairman Noubar Afeyan said Moderna determined it would be better to expand production itself than to share technology and plans to deliver billions of additional doses next year. “Within the next six to nine months, the most reliable way to make high-quality vaccines and in an efficient way is going to be if we make them,” Afeyan said. Zoltan Kis, an expert in messenger RNA vaccines at Britain’s University of Sheffield, said reproducing Moderna’s vaccine is “doable” but the task would be far easier if the company shared its expertise. Kis estimated the process involves fewer than a dozen major steps. But certain procedures are tricky, such as sealing the fragile messenger RNA in lipid nanoparticles, he said. “It’s like a very complicated cooking recipe,” he said. “Having the recipe would be very, very helpful, and it would also help if someone could show you how to do it.” A U.N.-backed public health organization still hopes to persuade Moderna that its approach to providing vaccines for poorer countries misses the mark. Formed in 2010, the Medicines Patent Pool initially focused on convincing pharmaceutical companies to share patents for AIDS drugs. “It’s not about outsiders helping Africa,” Executive Director Charles Gore said of the South Africa vaccine hub. “Africa wants to be empowered, and that’s what this is about.” It will eventually fall to Gore to try to resolve the intellectual property question. Work to recreate Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine is protected as research, so a potential dispute would surround steps to sell a replicated version commercially, he said. “It’s about persuading Moderna to work with us rather than using other methods,” Gore said. He said the Medicines Patent Pool repeatedly tried but failed to convince Pfizer and BioNTech to even discuss sharing their formulas. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, who is among the members of Congress backing a bill that calls on the United States to invest more in making and distributing COVID-19 vaccines in low- and middle-income countries, said reverse engineering isn’t going to happen fast enough to keep the virus from mutating and spreading further. “We need to show some hustle. We have to show a sense of urgency, and I’m not seeing that urgency,” he said. “Either we end this pandemic or we muddle our way through.” Campaigners argue the meager amount of vaccines available to poorer countries through donations, COVAX and purchases suggests the Western-dominated pharmaceutical industry is broken. “The enemy to these corporations is losing their potential profit down the line,” Joia Mukherjee, chief medical officer of the global health nonprofit Partners in Health, said. “The enemy isn’t the virus, the enemy isn’t suffering.” Back in Cape Town, the promise of using mRNA technology against other diseases motivates the young scientists. “The excitement is around learning how we harness mRNA technology to develop a COVID-19 vaccine,” Caryn Fenner, Afrigen's technical director, said. But more important, Fenner said, “is not only using the mRNA platform for COVID, but for beyond COVID.” ___ Cheng reported from London; Hinnant reported from Paris.

Comedy comeback: Laughing through COVID-19 with comedian Kate Davis,https://kitchener.citynews.ca/local-news/comedy-comeback-laughing-through-covid-19-with-comedian-kate-davis-4546091,,['Taylor Pace'],,Toronto-based comic Kate Davis will be performing at The Crazy Canuck in Kitchener for Rusty Nail's comedy comeback series on Oct. 29,,2021-10-24 20:30:00,"What happens when a comedian is forced to isolate alone in a room for 21 days? Well, they get a lot of material. Veteran comedian Kate Davis found herself isolated in her room for three weeks, sick with COVID-19 after gigging in BC in March 2020. “But I got some good bits out of it. I say I was 21 days in my bedroom alone. And as a mother of three, I felt like I'd won the lottery. I didn’t have to talk to them or cook or clean,” Davis said. She didn’t have any of the symptoms the doctors told her about. “But the one symptom I had -- I didn't realize I couldn't smell anything, until my teenage son walked in the room, and I couldn't smell him. And I'm like, I’ve got COVID for sure.” Davis has been in the comedy scene since she was 29, before the internet was saturated with comedy shows, she said. “It was in my second or third year of doing comedy that the Comedy Network launched,” she said. “Before, you really had to go to a club to see it.” But she happened to live around the corner from a comedy club, and passed by it regularly. One day she went in to see a show. “And I thought, you know what, I'm gonna give this a try. I think I could do this. And I did and never looked back.” Since then, her career has taken her touring across the country and to Europe. She also does motivational speaking, teaching people how to not take themselves so seriously and incorporate humour into their lives for a “more stress-free and healthier life.” “The most precious thing for me about stand up is it's impossible to laugh and not be in the moment. And we talk about mindfulness all the time. And it's like, the perfect way to be mindful, because you can’t not be when you're laughing. It's the one thing that all humans share -- laughter, no matter what language we're all speaking. So for me, it's just bringing everyone together, being in the moment, sharing in that moment. Davis says she has a lot of new material, much of it derived from her time in isolation. She is currently working on putting out a new EP. Her last album, House Arrest, is available for streaming on all platforms. Davis will be at The Crazy Canuck Oct. 29 for Rusty Nail’s comedy comeback series, along with Vito D'Amico and Dan Brennan. Since August 2020, local entertainment company Rusty Nail has been hosting pro comedy shows every Friday and Saturday night at The Crazy Canuck. They’ve been referring to it as the comedy comeback, because “people really thought that live comedy was dead,” said owner and comedian, Alex (Sandy) MacFarlane. “There was this thought that we’re never coming back; the comedy clubs are all going to close because they won’t be able to financially make it through this time,” he said. “So we wanted to be like, nah, we’re coming back. We’re going to push through all of this.” MacFarlane first got into comedy in 2008 through what he calls a purposeful accident, when a friend encouraged him to try his hand at an amateur night contest at a Yuk Yuks in London, Ont. To his surprise, he ended up winning the competition and was invited back to open for the headliner the following weekend. Being on stage petrified him, but the release of endorphins and adrenaline that hit him after was thrilling, and he became hooked on “the attention and the immediate gratification of a live audience.” “I wasn’t quite the class clown type, but I was always striving to make people laugh, and I had always admired comedians. So I think when I took my shot at it, people were surprised, but not overly surprised,” he said. He started producing shows in 2011, and five years and hundreds of shows later, he launched Rusty Nail. “I did it for two reasons: One, it got me stage time. If I produce the show, I put myself on the show. So it helped me as a comedian that way. But I also was in a pretty serious relationship at that time. And when you're when you're a comic, and you have to travel, especially in a country like Canada. It takes you away from your friends and family quite a bit,” he said. Plus, he loved comedy. So he began producing shows in the region. “It helped that I was a comedian because I knew the right things to do and the right way to treat the comedians,” he said. Throughout the pandemic, Rusty Nail has produced over 100 shows. “I don’t think anybody else in the country could say that,” he said. “At one point, we were the only comedy show in Canada running because we had a special spot downtown Kitchener where we could be outside.” They did a few virtual shows as well between December 2020 and February 2021 when lockdowns were in effect. “Making people laugh during this time was amazing. And at the end of the show, when people are coming up to you saying, that was so funny, I haven’t laughed like that in so long, or I really needed that. It's gold.” For MacFarlane, comedy can be a tool to escape from the craziness of the world. “If it’s COVID, your job, whatever, we’re just here to laugh, forget about that,” he said. “You know, that whole cheesy line about laughter being the best medicine. I really do believe it's true.” You can stay tuned on upcoming shows on their website .",https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/kitchenertoday/images/arts/195299006_493377401965201_13947716168825012_n.jpg;w=630,kitchenertoday

AUSTIN, Oct 25 — Lewis Hamilton had to settle for second but Formula One’s most successful driver said yesterday’s US Grand Prix in Austin still felt like a breakthrough for his sport.The race day crowd of 140,000 at the Circuit of the Americas surpassed the 135,000 who attended the Indianapolis 500 in May, then the largest sporting event in America since the start of the pandemic.The three-day crowd figure for the race in Texas was given as 400,000.“It feels like this is our acceptance into the US,” Hamilton, a five-times winner in Austin, said as he surveyed the scenes after the race.“I hope we get more races out here and I hope that the sport continues to grow because you can tell just how great the fans are out here.”There was no race in Austin last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic but Formula One will have two US rounds next year, with Miami making its debut.There has also been talk of further expansion, with Las Vegas seen as the most likely candidate.While there are no US drivers, the sport has been owned since 2017 by US-based Liberty Media who have targeted America as a key growth area.The sport struggled to make inroads in the past, particularly after an infamous six car race at Indianapolis in 2005 left huge reputational damage.The Texas weekend offered plenty of evidence of Formula One’s growing popularity, with many crediting the Netflix Drive to Survive documentary series, now filming season four.“I think Netflix has been outstanding for Formula One. It’s driven a younger fan base, it’s driven a much larger fan base. It’s really had an impact in America,” said McLaren’s American boss Zak Brown.“I think it’s doing what we as a sport would like it to do, which is turn on a bunch of new fans. I think it’s been hugely successful.”Hamilton’s Mercedes boss Toto Wolff agreed.“We were not keen at the beginning of Netflix because we wanted to concentrate on on-track performance and I was wrong. It’s clearly a big success,” he said.“Everywhere in the world it was the number one documentary on Netflix for quite a while and it’s become part of Formula One and you can clearly see it’s beneficial... the feedback that we get from fans is tremendous, especially here in the US”The attendance may also have been boosted by the lack of a race last year and the pandemic effect, with bottled-up demand for mass gatherings.The tense and thrilling battle between seven-times world champion Hamilton and Red Bull’s Sunday race winner and overall leader Max Verstappen has drawn new fans as well.Mexican Sergio Perez’s move to Red Bull this season as a race winner in a competitive car was another significant factor for fans from the region. — Reuters",2021-10-25 14:38:40,,,malaymail

In 2020 he returned to the show after an absence of four years. Hough announced in 2016 that he would leave the Dancing with the Stars ballroom floor behind. However, he did not leave the world of television behind, appearing as a judge on NBC’s World of Dance.  With great surprise and delight, Hough returned to the series that made him a household name to fill in for head judge Len Goodman. The 2020 season of DWTS filmed under tight coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions. Therefore, Goodman was unable to travel from his London home to the show’s LA location. Just ahead of DWTS’ season 30, Hough revealed he would sit as the fourth judge on the panel. The six-time mirrorball winner’s major announcement Derek Hough | ABC/Adrienne Raquel Hough announced on Instagram, “I’ve really enjoyed being a judge on DWTS, but this Monday, I get from behind the desk and hit the dance floor.” While he did not elaborate further on his performance in this post, fans shared their thrill at the prospect of Hough utilizing his dance talents on the show once again. One of these admirers was fellow judge Inaba who wrote, “It’s about time. I love when you dance, Derek! We all do! I can’t wait to see what magic you are bringing on Monday. And this suit! So good.” Hough’s fans echoed her sentiments. “Derek brightens my Mondays when he dances! I do miss him and his partners competing every week. His creative choreography,  his dancing, and how he brings THE best out of his partners,” wrote one viewer. “Can’t wait to watch!” penned a second follower.

NLC president, Comrade Ayuba Wabba, who stated this yesterday in Abuja, therefore, urged government and other employers of labour to make special arrangements for workers to access the vaccine at their places of work. He said, “I understand some people prefer to view COVID-19 vaccination with caution. Yes, it is important to proceed on issues of public health with great caution. Yet, it would be foolhardy to elevate caution above scientific evidence and facts from public health records. “The truth is that despite being imperfect, the COVID-19 vaccine has given all of us a better chance of fighting the virus and staying alive. I urge workers all over the world to take advantage of the COVID-19 vaccines and keep themselves, their families and their colleagues at work safe and free from the morbid threats of the coronavirus pandemic. “We urge the government and other employers of labour to make special arrangements for workers to access the vaccine at the workplace. “We urge that the tool of persuasion and conviction be used rather than force to get workers and the general populace to take the vaccine.”",,leadership

He is also set to perform on the November 6 episode of ""SNL,"" hosted by Kieran Culkin. It is unclear how his diagnosis will affect that live appearance. Last year, a planned ""SNL' performance by country singer Morgan Wallen was postponed after he was seen just days earlier partying and not practicing social distancing. Last week, Sheeran performed for Prince William and Kate and their guests at the inaugural Earthshot Prize awards . The awards ceremony, hosted by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, rewarded five people trying to save the planet with £1 million, BBC News reports. Along with Sheeran, several other stars were in attendance, including Coldplay, Emma Watson, Emma Thompson and David Oyelowo. The awards ceremony aimed to be environmentally friendly and asked that only guests already in London attend to limit air travel. So, Sheeran has been and will likely remain in London for the time being. The U.K.'s National Health System says those with COVID-19 symptoms should receive a PCR test and those without symptoms can receive a rapid test. In either case, if the test comes back positive, you are meant to self-isolate. There are covid-related travel restrictions in place for those traveling between the U.S. and the U.K. Currently, the CDC classifies the U.K. as a level four – or a country with a very high level of COVID-19. Most British nationals who have been in the U.K., Ireland, the Schengen zone, Iran, Brazil, China, South Africa or India within 14 days are not permitted to enter the U.S., according to the U.K. travel guidance , though there are some exceptions. The U.S. government said it would lift travel restrictions starting on November 8 for foreign citizens who are fully vaccinated.

He focuses on software, fintech, digital health and consumer investments. More posts by this contributor From startups to Starbucks: The embedded API opportunity How retailers can survive the Amazon era The quest to provide more affordable and accessible healthcare, magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic, has spurred an explosion of innovation, which in turn has attracted massive amounts of capital. To put this into perspective, consider this: In 2019, digital health saw $7.7 billion in VC investment, and that number rose to $14.6 billion in 2020. However, the first half of 2021 alone saw $14.7 billion in VC investment. Its marriage with fintech is the catalyst for the transformation of the healthcare industry. Similar to the unbundling of financial services and how fintech is scaling vertical SaaS, the pandemic-fueled disaggregation of healthcare has created new players that are taking a page out of the fintech revolution book — all starting with payments. A growing number of startups are now leveraging the fintech playbook to solve a key part of the healthcare problem — the shifting dynamics between patients, payers and providers, and how payments and related electronic health records (EHRs) flow between them. Not only is the onus of payments and data flow moving from payers to patients, but providers are now facing a monumental shift to new billing and engagement models, requiring new technologies and platforms to help with the change. Through the lens of fintech, here are three key areas to watch in healthcare. Gamifying consumer wellness to stave off chronic illnesses One of the largest trends impacting the population today is the steady rise of chronic illnesses. It is estimated that nearly half the U.S. population will have a chronic illness by 2025. People are getting sicker for longer periods of time, which leads to a constant spending streak. Patients not adhering to medical guidance is a major factor and is responsible for $100 billion of healthcare spending and over 100,000 deaths annually. With around a fifth of patients never filling their prescriptions, it has become a priority to educate and incentivize patients to complete care and avoid readmissions or ER visits. The convergence of health and fintech will be an important catalyst to address some of the most pressing issues facing healthcare today. To curb the rise of chronic illnesses and the associated recurring costs, many startups are using behavioral economics and gamification to incentivize patients and build healthy habits. For example, companies like Paceline in the U.S., Sweatcoin in Europe and Betterfly in Latin America gamify wellness by combining fitness and financial rewards. On the other hand, startups like Sempre Health and Wellth are tackling medical non-adherence with behavioral economics. For example, Wellth financially rewards actions like on-time prescription intake or regular A1c tests for diabetic patients. Fintech for affordability and reducing friction Looking at payers, there’s a major shift stemming from the rise of high-deductible healthcare plans (HDHP) — enrollment has risen 43% in the last five years — emphasizing an increase in premiums and patient financial responsibility. Out-of-pocket expenses threaten the financial stability for many, with 40% of Americans unable to pay an unexpected bill of $400.",2021-10-25 18:15:08,"The quest to provide more affordable and accessible healthcare, magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic, has spurred an explosion of innovation, which in turn has attracted massive amounts of capital.

They claimed: ""My 90-year-old grandparents have been trying to get their booster jabs at but it’s impossible to book one!"" Medics and scientific advisers have accused the government of messing up the booster and school-age vaccine rollout. Because of their failings restrictions could be imposed. According to projections produced by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Covid hospital admissions and deaths over the next year could be halved if 90 per cent of over-50s who become eligible for the booster take it.",,express

(AP) — Sarah Fillier scored twice, including the go-ahead goal with 3:58 remaining, and Canada beat the United States 3-2 in Game 2 of the rivals’ nine-game pre-Olympic series on Monday night. Victoria Bach also scored for Canada, which opened the series with a 3-1 win at Allentown, Pennsylvania, on Friday night. The Canadians, who beat the Americans for the gold medal at the world championships this summer, have now won four straight against the U.S. — their best run since a five-game streak from Dec. 3, 2017 to Feb. 15, 2018. Cayla Barnes had a goal and an assist and Amanda Kessel also scored for the U.S. The game featured a rematch of goaltenders from Canada’s 3-2 overtime win at worlds on Aug. 31. Canada’s Ann-Renee Desbiens stopped 18 shots while USA’s Nicole Hensley stopped 17. The series resumes at Kingston, Ontario, on Nov. 21. American defenseman Megan Keller committed an undisciplined roughing penalty that led to the decisive goal. Keller cross-checked a Canadian player near the benches. Brianne Jenner set up the goal by driving into the right circle and feeding a wide-open Fillier, who swept in the puck at the left post. Though the Americans rebounded from an early 2-0 deficit to tie the game at 2 on Kessel’s goal 5:34 into the second period, they have yet to enjoy a lead over the past two games. The world’s top women’s hockey powers are preparing for the Beijing Winter Games in February, with the Americans attempting to defend their 2018 gold medal. Five of their past eight meetings have been decided by one goal. The Americans vowed to learn from their lapses on Friday, and yet quickly fell into a 2-0 hole 5:03 in, with defensive breakdowns allowing Canada to score on its first two shots on net. Marie-Philip Poulin set up the opening goal 36 seconds in by beating Kelly Pannek off the puck at the right boards. U.S. defenders then backed up, allowing Bach to drive into the slot and lift a shot over Hensley’s glove. A defensive breakdown led to Fillier’s first goal. Canada’s Melodie Daoust outworked Natalie Buchbinder for the puck behind the net and was falling backward while getting a pass off to the left circle, where Natalie Spooner immediately fed a wide-open Fillier, who snapped it into the open right side. The Americans responded with Barnes’ power-play goal with 7:28 left in the first period. Barnes banked in a rising shot from the right point off the far post, with Desbiens screened by Lacey Eden.

Though the actors have played a couple all throughout season two, the new filming experience provided a host of challenges, with its sex scenes becoming a problem in particular. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, Victoria revealed that filming intimate scenes with each other was difficult initially in terms of their safety. “This is not a show where you can be like, ‘nobody’s going to kiss, it’ll be fine’, so it took months to figure out how to do it safely,” she told Entertainment Weekly.  “I felt very lucky that they start off their relationship at odds with each other, navigating the awkwardness of being new parents, because it felt strange to be physically intimate very early on – even though we’re supposed to be a married couple.” Fortunately, Victoria said she and Penn began to feel more comfortable as time went on.  Most read in Showbiz 'eyes opened' Strictly's Giovanni Pernice breaks silence on Maura Higgins split 'SHOCK & HEARTACHE' Alec Baldwin's wife breaks silence days after accidental shooting horror assault Damien Dempsey reveals he feared he'd die after Dublin chip shop attack HAPPY FAMILY Hazel O'Sullivan praises footie partner Andros Townsend for being hands-on-dad INSTA VS REALITY Stacey Solomon reveals secret drama behind picture-perfect Halloween snap GIO ON DATE APP Strictly's Giovanni was secretly on dating app behind Maura Higgins' back “It’s weird.

Penn agreed, adding: “It’s really true, the implications of all that stuff was really felt.” Showrunner Sera Gamble also revealed that they were “really lucky” to be able to do the show the way they wanted. Badgley added: “There were significant rewriters throughout the whole season to try and negotiate around these scenes that would require a lot of people.” The show will also be returning for season four, with die-hard fans desperate to know what will happen to Joe after a shock twist ending. Sera added that Joe has a “hole in his heart” and that fans will have to wait and see what will fix it while exploring his “baggage”.

"Vic has 1510 COVID-19 cases, four deaths",https://www.newcastleherald.com.au/story/7484010/vic-has-1510-covid-19-cases-four-deaths/?src=rss,,['Benita Kolovos'],,,,2021-10-25 22:12:14,"Victoria has recorded 1510 new COVID-19 cases and four deaths as new pandemic laws are set to be introduced to the state's parliament. The health department confirmed on Tuesday the state is managing 24,715 active cases. There are 817 people in hospital, 15 more than the previous day, with the seven-day average at 789. Of those, 147 are in intensive care and 88 on a ventilator. The latest deaths take the toll from the current outbreak to 234. There were 55,679 tests processed and 28,232 COVID-19 vaccine doses administered at state-run hubs on Monday. About 75 per cent of Victorians aged 16 and over are now fully vaccinated. The latest figures come as the state government is set to introduce new laws to parliament that would allow the health minister to make public health orders for the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the changes, Victoria's premier will have the power to ""declare"" a pandemic and extend it in three-month blocks for as long as considered necessary. The Public Health and Wellbeing (Pandemic Management) Bill 2021 will be introduced to the lower house as parliament resumes on Tuesday, several MPs have confirmed to AAP. Under the laws, the health minister will be provided ""broad powers to make pandemic orders"" on the chief health officer's advice, bringing Victoria in line with NSW and New Zealand where the health minister is directly accountable to parliament. An independent oversight committee will review public orders and their impact on human rights, while public health advice will need to be made public. The laws also introduce safeguards around protecting contact tracing and QR code information, while an aggravated offence will be created to ""deter ... the most egregious pandemic-related behaviours"". Court-imposed penalties will be introduced to stop businesses receiving commercial benefit after breaching a pandemic order. The bill aims to improve transparency in pandemic decision-making, with decision-makers to be accountable to parliament and the community, its summary said. It will replace the current state of emergency, which expires on December 15. The government has consulted with community groups, health and human rights experts and legal stakeholders on the proposed laws, and the bill is expected to pass the lower house but in the upper house it will require the backing of three of the 11 crossbenchers. Victoria's opposition said the new powers would give the premier ""more power with less accountability"", as it proposed the constitution be amended to require parliamentary approval for emergency or pandemic declarations. Tuesday's sitting is also the first since a vaccine mandate came into effect banning MPs from parliament if they refuse to provide proof of their vaccination status.

(AP Photo/Anupam Nath) | ASSOCIATED PRESS The mortality caused by a deadly pathogen is partly a reflection of the social and political order it attacks Never in our lifetimes, it seems, has there been greater uncertainty about the future — and greater ignorance of the past. At the beginning of 2020, very few people grasped the significance of the news coming out of Wuhan about a new coronavirus. When I first spoke and wrote publicly about the rising probability of a global pandemic, in the week ending Jan. 26, 2020, I was regarded as eccentric (certainly by the majority of the delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos, who seemed oblivious to the danger). The conventional wisdom at that time, from Fox News to The Washington Post, was that the coronavirus posed a lesser threat to Americans than the usual winter wave of influenza. On Feb. 2, I wrote, “We are now dealing with an epidemic in the world’s most populous country, which has a significant chance of becoming a global pandemic. ... The challenge is ... to resist that strange fatalism that leads most of us not to cancel our travel plans and not to wear uncomfortable masks, even when a dangerous virus is spreading exponentially.” Looking back, I read those sentences as a veiled confession. I was traveling manically in January and February, as I had done for most of the previous 20 years. In January, I flew from London to Dallas, from Dallas to San Francisco, and from there to Hong Kong (Jan. 8), Taipei (Jan. 10), Singapore (Jan. 13), Zurich (Jan. 19), back to San Francisco (Jan. 24), and then to Fort Lauderdale (Jan. 27). I wore a mask once or twice but found it intolerable after an hour and took it off. In the course of February, I flew almost as frequently, though not so far: to New York, Sun Valley, Bozeman, Washington and Lyford Cay in the Bahamas. You may wonder what kind of life that was. I used to joke that the lecture circuit had turned me into an “international man of history.” I realized only later that I might have been one of the “superspreaders” whose hyperactive travel schedules were spreading the virus from Asia to the rest of the world. My weekly newspaper column in the first half of 2020 became a kind of plague diary, though I never mentioned the fact that I was ill for most of February, with a painful cough I could not shake off. (To get through lectures, I relied heavily on the alternative medicine that some call Scotch.) “Worry about grandparents,” I wrote on Feb. 29; “the mortality rate for people in their eighties is above 14%, whereas it’s close to zero for those under 40.” I omitted the less comforting data on asthmatic men in their mid-50s. I also left out the fact that I went to see a doctor twice only to be told that — as more or less everywhere in the United States at that time — there were no tests available for COVID-19. All I knew was that it was serious, and not only for me and my family. As I wrote on March 1: “Those who blithely say, ‘This is no worse than the flu’ ... are missing the point. ... Uncertainty surrounds it because it is so difficult to detect in its early stages, when many carriers are both infectious and asymptomatic. We don’t know for sure how many people have it, so we don’t exactly know its reproduction number and its mortality rate. There’s no vaccine and there’s no cure.” In another article, published in The Wall Street Journal on March 8, I wrote, “If the U.S. turns out to have proportionately as many cases as South Korea, it will soon have some 46,000 cases and more than 300 deaths — or 1,200 deaths if the U.S. mortality rate is as high as Italy’s.” At that point, total confirmed cases in the U.S. stood at just 541; deaths at 22. We passed 46,000 cases on March 24 and 1,200 deaths on March 25, just over two weeks later. On March 15, I noted, “John F. Kennedy airport was thronged yesterday with people doing what, since time immemorial, they have done in times of plague: fleeing the big city (and spreading the virus). ... We are entering the panic phase of the pandemic.” That was the same day I myself flew, with my wife and my two youngest children, from California to Montana. We stayed there for a year. I wrote and thought about little else in the first half of 2020. Why this intense preoccupation? The answer is that, although my core competency is financial history, I have been keenly interested in the role of disease in history ever since studying the Hamburg cholera epidemic of 1892 as a graduate student more than 30 years ago. Richard Evans’ meticulously detailed study of that episode introduced me to the idea that the mortality caused by a deadly pathogen is partly a reflection of the social and political order it attacks. It was the class structure as much as the bacterium Vibrio cholerae that killed people in Hamburg, Germany, Evans argued, because the entrenched power of the city’s property owners had been an insuperable obstacle to improving the city’s antiquated water and sewage systems. The mortality rate for the poor was 13 times higher than for the rich. Researching “The Pity of War” a few years later, I was struck by statistics that suggested the German army had collapsed in 1918 partly because of a surge of illness, possibly resulting from the Spanish influenza pandemic. “The War of the World” (Penguin, 2006) delved more deeply into the history of the 1918-19 pandemic, showing how the First World War ended with twin pandemics — not only influenza but also the ideological contagion of Bolshevism. The work I did on empires in the 2000s also involved excursions into the history of contagious disease. No account of European settlement in the New World could have omitted the role that disease played in “thinning the Indians, to make room for the English,” as John Archdale, the governor of Carolina in the 1690s, callously remarked. (The title of the second chapter of my book “Empire” was “White Plague.”) I was also very struck by the terrible toll of tropical disease on British soldiers stationed far from home: A man’s chances of surviving a tour of duty in Sierra Leone were pitifully low — 1 in 2. “The Great Degeneration” (Penguin, 2014) explicitly warned of our growing vulnerability to “the ... random mutation of viruses like influenza,” while “The Square and the Tower” (Penguin, 2017) was essentially a history of the world based on the insight that “network structures are as important as viruses in determining the speed and extent of a contagion.” The COVID-19 pandemic is far from over. The death toll worldwide approaches five million, which is certainly an underestimate, as the statistics from a number of large countries (notably Iran and Russia) cannot be trusted. And the cumulative body count continues to rise globally — to say nothing of the number of people whose health has been permanently damaged, which no one has yet estimated. It seems increasingly likely that Lord Martin Rees, Britain’s astronomer royal, has won his bet with the Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker that “bioterror or bioerror will lead to one million casualties in a single event within a six month period starting no later than Dec 31 2020.” Some epidemiologists have argued that, without drastic social distancing and economic lockdowns, the ultimate death toll could have been between 30 million and 40 million. Because of government restrictions and changes in public behavior, it will surely not be as high. ASSOCIATED PRESS Cemetery workers lower the coffin of a COVID-19 victim into his grave at the Vila Formosa cemetery in Sao Paulo, Brazil, late Wednesday, March 31, 2021. Because of the increased number of deaths in the city, the burial service in some public cemeteries has been extended to the hours of the night. (AP Photo/Nelson Antoine) Yet precisely these “nonpharmaceutical interventions” have inflicted a shock on the world economy far greater than that caused by the 2008-09 financial crisis — potentially as great as the shock of the Great Depression, but compressed into months, not years. Governments had to take drastic fiscal measures to stave off a collapse of the markets. You see, disasters and their impact are rarely entirely exogenous events, with the exception of a massive meteor strike, which hasn’t happened in 66 million years, or an alien invasion, which hasn’t happened at all. Even a catastrophic earthquake is only as catastrophic as the extent of urbanization along the fault line — or the shoreline, if it triggers a tsunami. A pandemic is made up of a new pathogen and the social networks that it attacks. We cannot understand the scale of the contagion by studying only the virus itself, because the virus will infect only as many people as social networks allow it to. At the same time, a catastrophe lays bare the societies and states that it strikes. It is a moment of truth, of revelation, exposing some as fragile, others as resilient, and others as “antifragile” — able not just to withstand disaster but to be strengthened by it. We still find ourselves in the middle of this pandemic, about which it’s hard to gain the perspective that hindsight affords. But looking at past pandemics and disasters not only helps provide perspective on the current one, but also allow us to understand and prepare for the inevitability of the next one. So cometh now My Lady Influenza, like a star Inebriously wan, and in her train Fever, the haggard soul’s white nenuphur, And lily-fingered Death, and grisly Pain And Constipation who makes all things vain, Pneumonyer, Cancer, and Nasal Catarrh. Rupert Brooke’s “To My Lady Influenza” (1906) was a facetious undergraduate work. Yet “Lady Influenza” was never to be trifled with. The first well-described influenza outbreaks were in 16th-century Europe, but the earliest was probably in 1173. There had been significant influenza pandemics in the 18th and 19th centuries, but the 20th century was to be hit much harder. A more populous world was also a more urban world and a more mobile world — a world in which low air quality in industrial towns may have made people more susceptible to respiratory illnesses. A year after Brooke wrote “To My Lady Influenza,” his eldest brother, Dick, died of pneumonia at the age of 26. Brooke himself would live only a year longer, dying of an infected mosquito bite that led to sepsis, off the Greek island of Skyros. A predictable “gray rhino,” in the sense that danger of a general European war was well known, but also a surprising “black swan,” in the sense that contemporaries seemed bewildered by its outbreak, the First World War was a true dragon-king event in terms of its vast historical consequences. As disastrous as the war was, its proximate impact in terms of lives lost was exceeded by that of the influenza pandemic that broke out in its final year. Where exactly the new strain of H1N1 first appeared is uncertain, but it is usually said to have been Fort Riley, Kansas, the site of Camp Funston, one of the network of Army camps where hundreds of thousands of young American men were being trained to fight in Europe as the American Expeditionary Forces. There is, however, evidence that the pandemic originated in the British Army in 1917, though the condition was initially identified as “purulent bronchitis with bronchopneumonia.” Here was the key to influenza’s 20th-century success. Never had armies been mobilized on such a scale before — more than 70 million men in uniform. Never had so many young men been taken from their homes and workplaces, crowded into primitive accommodations, and sent over long distances in ships and trains. The idea that the virus originated in pigs has been refuted (an avian origin seems more likely); if anything, the direction of infection was from men to pigs. The first American cases were recorded at Camp Funston on March 4. A week later, a member of Fort Riley’s catering staff entered the infirmary, followed in the coming days by a stream of infected soldiers. By the end of the month, more than a thousand cases had been recorded and 48 men had died of influenza. As if to mock the efforts of men to kill one another, the virus spread rapidly across the United States and then crossed to Europe on the jam-packed American troopships. It is possible that the pandemic explains the near doubling of the proportion of German soldiers reporting sick in the summer of 1918, which was a crucial factor in the imperial army’s subsequent collapse. Certainly, we have reports of German prisoners of war with the flu from July. By that time it had reached India, Australia and New Zealand. A few months later, a second and deadlier wave struck all but simultaneously in Brest, France; Freetown, Sierra Leone; and Boston. The virus made a new landfall in the United States at Boston’s Commonwealth Pier on Aug. 27, 1918, when three cases of influenza appeared on the sick list. Eight cases emerged the next day, and 58 the next, 15 of whom were so ill they were transferred to the U.S. Naval Hospital in Chelsea. On Sept. 8, influenza arrived at the Army’s Camp Devens. Within 10 days, thousands of feverish patients overwhelmed the camp’s hospitals; within weeks, the morgue was full of blue-tinged, asphyxiated corpses. Combatant countries sought to suppress the news of the pandemic as potentially harmful to wartime morale; this hardly helped to keep the public informed. The disease came to be known as the Spanish flu because only the largely uncensored press of neutral Spain reported on it with any accuracy. Between 40 million and 50 million people died as a result of the pandemic, the majority of them suffocated by a lethal accumulation of blood and other fluid in the lungs. The absolute numbers were highest in India (18.5 million deaths) and China (between 4 million and 9.5 million), but death rates varied widely from place to place. Close to half (44.5%) of the population of Cameroon was wiped out; in Western Samoa, nearly a quarter (23.6%). The worst mortality rates in Europe were in Hungary and Spain (each around 1.2%), with Italy not far behind. By contrast, North America got off lightly: between 0.53% and 0.65% for the United States, 0.61% for Canada. As these figures imply, the Spanish flu was indifferent as to a country’s combatant status. While its initial spread may have been related to wartime accommodation and transportation, that soon ceased to be true. In the United States, the deaths of as many as 675,000 people were attributed to the Spanish flu, of which 550,000 were excess deaths (above what would have been expected in that period under normal circumstances). Equivalent mortality in 2020 would have been between 1.8 million and 2.2 million Americans. The Spanish flu killed an order of magnitude more Americans than died in combat in the war (53,402). Ironically, unlike most flu epidemics, but like the war that preceded and spread it, the influenza of 1918 disproportionately killed young adults. Out of 272,500 male influenza deaths in the United States, nearly 49% were aged 20 to 39, whereas only 18% were under five and 13% were over 50. The very young and very old were also (as usual) vulnerable, so that all countries for which age-specific death rates are available recorded a roughly W-shaped age distribution of mortality. Death was not caused by the influenza virus itself so much as by the body’s immunological reaction to the virus. Perversely, this meant that individuals with the strongest immune systems were more likely to die than those with weaker immune systems. A good illustration of the impact of the pandemic on young adults, as well as a vivid description of the hallucinogenic miseries of the illness itself, can be found in Katherine Anne Porter’s short story “Pale Horse, Pale Rider” (1937), about a wartime romance cut cruelly short by the virus. In Sept. 2021, COVID-19’s American death toll overtook that of the 1918 flu. And yet, in Aug. 2020, it appeared that, with a regime of mass testing, contact tracing, social distancing and targeted quarantining, a country could contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2, as the virus relied heavily on superspreaders for its transmission and disproportionately sickened or killed people past retirement age. Only in the spring of 2021 did it join the elite of pandemics — the 20 or so in recorded history that killed upward of 0.05% of humanity. Only a handful of those nations that fought World War II have lost more people per day to COVID-19 than they have lost to the Axis powers. The United States is one of those countries. This illustrates something profound — that all disasters are at some level man-made political disasters, even if they originate with new pathogens. Politics explained why World War II killed 25 times as many Germans as Americans. Politics also helps to explain why COVID-19 has thus far killed more than eight times as many Americans as Germans.

Coronavirus cases in India are surging faster than anywhere else in the world. (AP Photo/Anupam Nath) This plague began as a gray rhino, predicted by many. It struck as a black swan, somehow completely unforeseen. Could it become a world-changing “dragon king”? As we have seen, disasters of any kind become truly epoch-making events only if their economic, social and political ramifications amount to more than the excess mortality they cause. Could this medium-size disaster nevertheless alter our lives permanently and profoundly? Let me now hazard three guesses. First, COVID-19 will be to social life what AIDS was to sexual life: It will change our behavior, though by no means enough to avert a significant number of premature deaths. I myself welcome a new age of social distancing, but then I am a natural misanthrope who hates crowds and will not greatly miss hugs and handshakes. Most people, however, will be unable to resist the temptations of post-lockdown gregariousness. There will be unsafe socializing just as there still is unsafe sex, even after more than three decades and 30 million deaths from HIV. Second, and for that reason, most big cities are not “over.” Do we all now head from Gotham or the Great Wen to the villages, there to cultivate our vegetable gardens in splendid, rustic isolation? Do nearly half of us continue to work from home, as we did during the pandemic — more than three times more than before? Probably not. It takes a lot to kill a city. True, just over a century after Thomas Mann wrote “Death in Venice” (1912), Venice is pretty much dead. But it was not cholera that killed it — it was the shifting pattern of international trade. Likewise, COVID-19 will not kill London or New York; it will just make them cheaper, grungier and younger. Some billionaires will not return. Some firms and many families will move to the suburbs or even farther afield. Tax revenues will drop. Crime rates will jump. As Gerald Ford supposedly did in 1975, when the city asked for a federal bailout, another president may tell New York to “drop dead.” San Francisco will lose talent to Austin. But inertia is a powerful thing. Americans these days relocate less than they used to. Only a third of jobs can really be done at home; everyone else will still need to work in offices, shops and factories. Workplaces will just be different — more spacious and campus-like, as they already are in Silicon Valley. Commuting will no longer involve being packed like sardines on a subway. No more unwelcome intimacies on elevators. Masks over most faces. No more tut-tutting at the hijab and the niqab. Perforce, we are all modest now. What of the pandemic’s impact on the generational imbalances that had grown so intolerable in many societies by 2020? Was COVID-19 sent by Freya, the goddess of youth, to emancipate millennials and Generation Z from bearing the fiscal burden of an excessive number of elderly people? It is tempting to marvel at this ageist virus. No previous pandemic was so discriminating against the elderly and in favor of the young. But in truth, the impact of COVID-19 in terms of excess mortality will probably not be great enough to balance the intergenerational accounts. In the short run, the majority of old people will remain retired; relatively few will die prematurely — hardly any in the most elderly of countries, Japan. The young, meanwhile, will be the ones struggling to find jobs (other than with Amazon) and struggling almost as much to have fun. An economy without crowds is not a “new normal.” It may be more like the new anomie, to borrow Émile Durkheim’s term for the sense of disconnectedness he associated with modernity. For most young people, the word “fun” is almost synonymous with “crowd.” The era of distancing will be a time of depression in the psychological as well as the economic sense. The gloom has been especially deep for Generation Z, whose university social lives — half the point of college, if not more — were wrecked. They spent yet more time on electronic devices — perhaps an hour a day more than before the pandemic. It did not make them happier. History tells us to expect the great punctuation marks of disaster in no predictable order. The four horsemen of the Book of Revelation — Conquest, War, Famine and the pale rider Death — gallop out at seemingly random intervals to remind us that no amount of technological innovation can make mankind invulnerable. Indeed, some innovations — like those fleets of jet airplanes that transported so many infected people from Wuhan to the rest of the world in Jan. 2020 — give the horsemen the opportunity to ride in their slipstream. Yet somehow the riders’ arrival always takes us by surprise. For a moment, we contemplate the scenario of total extinction. We shelter in place, watching “Contagion” or reading Atwood. Perhaps the black swan becomes a dragon king and turns life upside down. But very rarely. Mostly, for the lucky many, life after the disaster goes on, changed in a few ways but on the whole remarkably, reassuringly, boringly the same. With astonishing speed, we put our brush with mortality behind us and blithely carry on, forgetful of those who were not so lucky, regardless of the next disaster that lies in wait. Think, if you doubt the truth of this, of Daniel Defoe’s concluding doggerel from his “Journal of the Plague Year”: A dreadful Plague in London was, In the Year Sixty Five, Which swept an Hundred Thousand Souls Away; yet I alive!

At the beginning of 2020, very few people grasped the significance of the news coming out of Wuhan about a new coronavirus. When I first spoke and wrote publicly about the rising probability of a global pandemic, in the week ending Jan. 26, 2020, I was regarded as eccentric (certainly by the majority of the delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos, who seemed oblivious to the danger). The conventional wisdom at that time, from Fox News to The Washington Post, was that the coronavirus posed a lesser threat to Americans than the usual winter wave of influenza. On Feb. 2, I wrote, “We are now dealing with an epidemic in the world’s most populous country, which has a significant chance of becoming a global pandemic. ... The challenge is ... to resist that strange fatalism that leads most of us not to cancel our travel plans and not to wear uncomfortable masks, even when a dangerous virus is spreading exponentially.” Looking back, I read those sentences as a veiled confession. Related Is there hope for the family after the pandemic? Or will the battle of the sexes rage on? The river is round I was traveling manically in January and February, as I had done for most of the previous 20 years. In January, I flew from London to Dallas, from Dallas to San Francisco, and from there to Hong Kong (Jan. 8), Taipei (Jan. 10), Singapore (Jan. 13), Zurich (Jan. 19), back to San Francisco (Jan. 24), and then to Fort Lauderdale (Jan. 27). I wore a mask once or twice but found it intolerable after an hour and took it off. In the course of February, I flew almost as frequently, though not so far: to New York, Sun Valley, Bozeman, Washington and Lyford Cay in the Bahamas. You may wonder what kind of life that was. I used to joke that the lecture circuit had turned me into an “international man of history.” I realized only later that I might have been one of the “superspreaders” whose hyperactive travel schedules were spreading the virus from Asia to the rest of the world. My weekly newspaper column in the first half of 2020 became a kind of plague diary, though I never mentioned the fact that I was ill for most of February, with a painful cough I could not shake off. (To get through lectures, I relied heavily on the alternative medicine that some call Scotch.) “Worry about grandparents,” I wrote on Feb. 29; “the mortality rate for people in their eighties is above 14%, whereas it’s close to zero for those under 40.” I omitted the less comforting data on asthmatic men in their mid-50s. I also left out the fact that I went to see a doctor twice only to be told that — as more or less everywhere in the United States at that time — there were no tests available for COVID-19. All I knew was that it was serious, and not only for me and my family. As I wrote on March 1: “Those who blithely say, ‘This is no worse than the flu’ ... are missing the point. ... Uncertainty surrounds it because it is so difficult to detect in its early stages, when many carriers are both infectious and asymptomatic. We don’t know for sure how many people have it, so we don’t exactly know its reproduction number and its mortality rate. There’s no vaccine and there’s no cure.” In another article, published in The Wall Street Journal on March 8, I wrote, “If the U.S. turns out to have proportionately as many cases as South Korea, it will soon have some 46,000 cases and more than 300 deaths — or 1,200 deaths if the U.S. mortality rate is as high as Italy’s.” At that point, total confirmed cases in the U.S. stood at just 541; deaths at 22. We passed 46,000 cases on March 24 and 1,200 deaths on March 25, just over two weeks later. On March 15, I noted, “John F. Kennedy airport was thronged yesterday with people doing what, since time immemorial, they have done in times of plague: fleeing the big city (and spreading the virus). ... We are entering the panic phase of the pandemic.” That was the same day I myself flew, with my wife and my two youngest children, from California to Montana. We stayed there for a year. I wrote and thought about little else in the first half of 2020. Why this intense preoccupation? The answer is that, although my core competency is financial history, I have been keenly interested in the role of disease in history ever since studying the Hamburg cholera epidemic of 1892 as a graduate student more than 30 years ago. Richard Evans’ meticulously detailed study of that episode introduced me to the idea that the mortality caused by a deadly pathogen is partly a reflection of the social and political order it attacks. It was the class structure as much as the bacterium Vibrio cholerae that killed people in Hamburg, Germany, Evans argued, because the entrenched power of the city’s property owners had been an insuperable obstacle to improving the city’s antiquated water and sewage systems. The mortality rate for the poor was 13 times higher than for the rich. Researching “The Pity of War” a few years later, I was struck by statistics that suggested the German army had collapsed in 1918 partly because of a surge of illness, possibly resulting from the Spanish influenza pandemic. “The War of the World” (Penguin, 2006) delved more deeply into the history of the 1918-19 pandemic, showing how the First World War ended with twin pandemics — not only influenza but also the ideological contagion of Bolshevism. The work I did on empires in the 2000s also involved excursions into the history of contagious disease. No account of European settlement in the New World could have omitted the role that disease played in “thinning the Indians , to make room for the English , ” as John Archdale, the governor of Carolina in the 1690s, callously remarked. (The title of the second chapter of my book “Empire” was “White Plague.”) I was also very struck by the terrible toll of tropical disease on British soldiers stationed far from home: A man’s chances of surviving a tour of duty in Sierra Leone were pitifully low — 1 in 2. “ The Great Degeneration” (Penguin, 2014) explicitly warned of our growing vulnerability to “the ... random mutation of viruses like influenza,” while “The Square and the Tower” (Penguin, 2017) was essentially a history of the world based on the insight that “network structures are as important as viruses in determining the speed and extent of a contagion.” The COVID-19 pandemic is far from over. The death toll worldwide approaches five million, which is certainly an underestimate, as the statistics from a number of large countries (notably Iran and Russia) cannot be trusted. And the cumulative body count continues to rise globally — to say nothing of the number of people whose health has been permanently damaged, which no one has yet estimated. It seems increasingly likely that Lord Martin Rees, Britain’s astronomer royal, has won his bet with the Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker that “bioterror or bioerror will lead to one million casualties in a single event within a six month period starting no later than Dec 31 2020.” Some epidemiologists have argued that, without drastic social distancing and economic lockdowns, the ultimate death toll could have been between 30 million and 40 million. Because of government restrictions and changes in public behavior, it will surely not be as high. Cemetery workers lower the coffin of a COVID-19 victim into his grave at the Vila Formosa cemetery in Sao Paulo, Brazil, late Wednesday, March 31, 2021. Because of the increased number of deaths in the city, the burial service in some public cemeteries has been extended to the hours of the night. (AP Photo/Nelson Antoine) ASSOCIATED PRESS Yet precisely these “nonpharmaceutical interventions” have inflicted a shock on the world economy far greater than that caused by the 2008-09 financial crisis — potentially as great as the shock of the Great Depression, but compressed into months, not years. Governments had to take drastic fiscal measures to stave off a collapse of the markets. You see, disasters and their impact are rarely entirely exogenous events, with the exception of a massive meteor strike, which hasn’t happened in 66 million years, or an alien invasion, which hasn’t happened at all. Even a catastrophic earthquake is only as catastrophic as the extent of urbanization along the fault line — or the shoreline, if it triggers a tsunami. A pandemic is made up of a new pathogen and the social networks that it attacks. We cannot understand the scale of the contagion by studying only the virus itself, because the virus will infect only as many people as social networks allow it to. At the same time, a catastrophe lays bare the societies and states that it strikes. It is a moment of truth, of revelation, exposing some as fragile, others as resilient, and others as “antifragile” — able not just to withstand disaster but to be strengthened by it. We still find ourselves in the middle of this pandemic, about which it’s hard to gain the perspective that hindsight affords. But looking at past pandemics and disasters not only helps provide perspective on the current one, but also allow us to understand and prepare for the inevitability of the next one. So cometh now My Lady Influenza, like a star Inebriously wan, and in her train Fever, the haggard soul’s white nenuphur, And lily-fingered Death, and grisly Pain And Constipation who makes all things vain, Pneumonyer, Cancer, and Nasal Catarrh. Rupert Brooke’s “To My Lady Influenza” (1906) was a facetious undergraduate work. Yet “Lady Influenza” was never to be trifled with. The first well-described influenza outbreaks were in 16th-century Europe, but the earliest was probably in 1173. There had been significant influenza pandemics in the 18th and 19th centuries, but the 20th century was to be hit much harder. A more populous world was also a more urban world and a more mobile world — a world in which low air quality in industrial towns may have made people more susceptible to respiratory illnesses. A year after Brooke wrote “To My Lady Influenza,” his eldest brother, Dick, died of pneumonia at the age of 26. Brooke himself would live only a year longer, dying of an infected mosquito bite that led to sepsis, off the Greek island of Skyros. A predictable “gray rhino,” in the sense that danger of a general European war was well known, but also a surprising “black swan,” in the sense that contemporaries seemed bewildered by its outbreak, the First World War was a true dragon-king event in terms of its vast historical consequences. As disastrous as the war was, its proximate impact in terms of lives lost was exceeded by that of the influenza pandemic that broke out in its final year. Where exactly the new strain of H1N1 first appeared is uncertain, but it is usually said to have been Fort Riley, Kansas, the site of Camp Funston, one of the network of Army camps where hundreds of thousands of young American men were being trained to fight in Europe as the American Expeditionary Forces. There is, however, evidence that the pandemic originated in the British Army in 1917, though the condition was initially identified as “purulent bronchitis with bronchopneumonia.” Here was the key to influenza’s 20th-century success. Never had armies been mobilized on such a scale before — more than 70 million men in uniform. Never had so many young men been taken from their homes and workplaces, crowded into primitive accommodations, and sent over long distances in ships and trains. The idea that the virus originated in pigs has been refuted (an avian origin seems more likely); if anything, the direction of infection was from men to pigs. The first American cases were recorded at Camp Funston on March 4. A week later, a member of Fort Riley’s catering staff entered the infirmary, followed in the coming days by a stream of infected soldiers. By the end of the month, more than a thousand cases had been recorded and 48 men had died of influenza.

TUARAN, Oct 24 — The Sabah government hopes that its needs and claims in the Malaysia Agreement 1963 (MA63) be considered when tabling the bill in Parliament tomorrow to amend the Federal Constitution so as to be in line with this agreement.Chief Minister Datuk Hajiji Noor said the Sabah government had given its views on the state’s position and claims in line with MA63 at the special meeting held on October 18, so he hoped these could be realised.“We had the MA63 Special Meeting chaired by the Prime Minister (Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob) last week and several proposals in amending the constitution were made.“I have been informed that Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Parliament and Law), Datuk Seri Wan Junaidi Tuanku Jaafar would be tabling the bill.“The Sarawak government has also given its views on MA63. So, our hope is for our needs and claims be considered in amending the constitution at the next parliamentary sitting which will start tomorrow,” he told reporters, here, today.He was asked to comment on Wan Junaidi’s statement that the government would continue with its plan to table the bill in Parliament next Tuesday for the amendments to be in line with MA63.However, Wan Junaidi said in the statement yesterday that the second reading of the bill would be rescheduled to another date from the earlier planned date of October 28 to enable the Attorney-General to explain further the proposed amendments to members of the Cabinet.Earlier, Hajiji officiated at the state-level Urban Poor Career Carnival organised by the Sabah Social Security Organisation (Socso), offering over 1,000 job vacancies with15 employers participating in the job interview programme held in conjunction with the carnival.He said this effort could help the vulnerable urban residents and B40 group including school leavers, graduates and those who had lost their jobs to find employment.“Cooperation between the state government and Sabah Socso has also managed to find employment for 4,864 individuals in the first nine months of this year, hence helping to reduce the unemployment rate.“This is a very good move in the country’s process of reviving and invigorating the economy,” he said, adding that Sabah Socso had organised 307 interview sessions with the cooperation of various industries and employers during the Covid-19 pandemic.In line with the Sabah Maju Jaya Direction, Sabah Socso had also established strategic collaboration with the state government to help stabilise and manage the labour market through continuous employment service activities, he said. — Bernama",2021-10-24 09:37:45,,,malaymail

COVID-19's route from pandemic to endemic,https://www.newcastleherald.com.au/story/7479895/covid-19s-route-from-pandemic-to-endemic/?src=rss,,['Damon Cronshaw'],,"For a virus to become truly endemic, infection starts at birth.",,2021-10-24 08:00:00,"Newcastle-based viral immunologist Nathan Bartlett says there is a long way to go before the COVID-19 pandemic shifts to an endemic. ""We're still very much trying to understand how this virus will behave in the long term,"" said Associate Professor Bartlett , of HMRI and the University of Newcastle. ""At the moment we're still in a game of tug-of-war with this virus, as we work towards a high level of sustained immunity in the population."" He said it may take several years for immunity to ""slowly but surely be established and maintained"". ""If or when it becomes an endemic virus is still very unclear."" He said the push for immunity in the population was essentially a war with the virus, amid battles for the number of cases and severe disease to slowly fall. ""You eventually get to an equilibrium where COVID-19 would almost always be a mild infection, where everyone has some level of immunity and it's more like the flu by that stage. ""We're still a long way from there, unfortunately. There's a long way to go."" Dr Bartlett said an endemic meant ""a relatively predictable level of infection within a given geographical area"". For example, we know when flu season peaks. ""Some seasons are worse than others, depending on how the virus changes. But we all have some level of persistent immunity to flu, which is boosted by the flu vaccine."" The flu vaccine is updated annually to give the best possible protection, which is a particularly important measure for the elderly and those with chronic diseases. There were many endemic respiratory viruses - including the other coronaviruses - that ""we all get infected with early in life and repeatedly throughout life"". For a virus to become truly endemic, infection starts at birth. ""All respiratory viruses infect people as infants and children. They get lots of infections, but children's immune systems are such that they don't usually get seriously ill with these respiratory viruses. COVID is a great example of that. ""Kids get lots of respiratory viruses, but they won't get super ill except in very rare cases - a lot less rarely than older adults, certainly."" When children get infected with endemic viruses, the immune system ""establishes a level of baseline immunity"". ""Of course, that doesn't happen when a new virus introduces itself into a population. The majority of the population are adults. ""And so now you have an adult immune system faced with a new virus. That's a very different equation in terms of the sort of disease profile that carries. ""This is why the elderly and even middle-aged adults are very vulnerable to COVID."" Nevertheless, he said COVID can cause serious illness and death in some younger people ""because we haven't established any level of immunity from birth because the virus wasn't endemic"". ""If this virus is still circulating for years to come, babies will be exposed to it from birth and carry that immune protection into adulthood and indeed it will be a true endemic virus. ""It won't kill you, you'll probably get infected multiple times as a child and develop a level of immunity. So when you do reach adulthood, it's not going to whack you around as much."" Globally, governments have managed the pandemic as a balance between protecting people from the virus and protecting economies, amid struggles between individual rights and the common good. Asked if he thought we'd been too accepting in NSW of harsh restrictions, Dr Bartlett said: ""We had no choice"". ""We had a window of opportunity in early 2021 to get everyone vaccinated before winter. Obviously that didn't happen."" As Delta spread in Sydney and elsewhere, NSW cities and regions entered various levels of lockdown. ""It really couldn't go any other way because how else could you protect everyone until there was a high level of vaccine-induced immune protection?"" And while COVID posed a serious public health risk, lockdown came with rises in unemployment and isolation that also posed health risks. The questions for governments became about how much risk should be taken. ""Risk equations can go on and on. I totally get the frustration around this,"" Dr Bartlett said. ""But it is largely counterproductive and doesn't get you anywhere because the risk moves as the virus and levels of infection change. We can have an outbreak and you're in a whole different scenario."" IN THE NEWS: Our journalists work hard to provide local, up-to-date news to the community.

While many parents were overjoyed at the news that Health Canada is considering approval of the first COVID-19 vaccine for kids age five to 11 in Canada, parents like Hubert are feeling more trepidatious, and public health officials said they are going to have a much more nuanced conversation with parents about vaccination than they did with adults. While 82 per cent of eligible Canadians aged 12 and up are already fully vaccinated, a recent survey by Angus Reid shows only 51 per cent of parents plan to immediately vaccinate their kids when a pediatric dose becomes available. Of parents with children in the five to 11 year age range, 23 per cent said they would never give their kids a COVID-19 vaccine, 18 per cent said they would wait, and nine per cent said they weren’t sure, according to the survey of 5,011 Canadians between Sept. 29 and Oct. 3, which cannot be assigned a margin of error because online surveys are not considered random samples. “Most of the research that I've seen sort of indicates that parents are more hesitant to vaccinate their kids against COVID than themselves,” said Kate Allen, a post-doctoral fellow at the Center for Vaccine Preventable Diseases of the University of Toronto. There are several reasons parents might pause, she said. It’s true that children are at a much lower risk of serious outcomes associated with COVID-19, and there have been very rare incidents of mRNA vaccines like Pfizer or Moderna linked to cases of myocarditis, a swelling of the heart muscle. As of Oct. 1, Health Canada has documented 859 cases associated with the vaccines, which mainly seem to affect people under 40 years old, and people who’ve developed the complication have typically been fine. “I know it's rare, I know it's not deadly, but I also see the risk of severe symptoms from COVID as being rare and not deadly for Jackson,” Hubert said when asked about weighing up the risks and benefits of the vaccine. But public health experts stress that some children do suffer from rare but serious impacts from COVID-19, which can also cause myocarditis as well as the little-understood impacts of the condition known as long COVID. They say parents should consider the less tangible benefits of vaccination as well. “It's less of a conversation about a direct benefit to them, and more of a community benefit,” Allen said. The pandemic has taken a heavy toll on children, depriving them of school, time with their peers, extracurriculars — and their mental health has suffered as a result, said Dr. Vinita Dubey, associate medical officer of health with Toronto Public Health. “Not one child has been spared from this pandemic. I mean every single child has had to bear a sacrifice because of the pandemic in one way or the other,” Dubey said. So far Pfizer-BioNtech is the only manufacturer to request approval for its pediatric COVID-19 vaccine and Health Canada is still reviewing the data. The regulator has promised the review will be thorough, and the vaccine will only be approved for children if the benefits outweigh the potential risks. Policy-makers know they’re going to have to take parents' concerns seriously as well. On a recent tour of the Childrens’ Hospital of Eastern Ontario in Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with Dr. Anne Pham-Huy, a pediatric infectious diseases physician. “Vaccine confidence is going to be the most important part of it this time around,” Pham-Huy said, to which Trudeau agreed. Dubey has published research on improving parents’ vaccine confidence when it comes to long-established inoculations like mumps and rubella. While she offered several tips, they mainly come down to building trust. Her research focused on the role of family doctors, but she said during the pandemic anyone can be that trusted sounding board. “It could be a faith leader, it could be an important family member or friend, someone who you trust, to help guide you to the right sources to make that decision,” she said. With that in mind, several students from across North America launched a peer-to-peer education program called Students for Herd Immunity to allow kids to have those conversations among themselves. The public health experts agree, the debate around vaccines has become polarized and open conversations will be the key to addressing parents' concerns. “I think one thing to say to parents is you don't have to make your decision right away,” Dubey said. “I mean for those who are ready to make their decision, but it's fine but if you have questions, seek the answers.” Her only advice is to get those answers from a trusted source, and not social media.

MIRI, Oct 25 — A Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR) member said there could be a three- or even five-cornered fight for the Marudi state seat currently held by Assistant Minister of Local Government and Housing Datu Dr Penguang Manggil in the next state election.PKR Marudi chairman Elias Lipi Mat, himself a potential candidate for the seat, said apart from his party, the other likely contenders would be Progressive Democratic Party (PDP) representing the current ruling coalition Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS), and Parti Sarawak Bersatu (PSB) who is said to be fielding former assemblyman Datuk Sylvester Entri Muran.“There are also rumours about PBK (Parti Bumi Kenyalang) and Bersatu (Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia) having their respective candidates for Marudi,” he said.“With good planning, I believe that PKR has a good election manifesto.“We have many local issues and agenda that should draw the attention of the voters in Marudi, one of which is the basic infrastructure such as clean water and electricity supply, as well as roads — all of which have yet to be addressed properly over the years.“Such matters may look petty to others, but they are very close to the people, especially those living in the rural and remote areas,” said Elias in a statement.Moreover, he said the Marudi sub-branch of the PKR would be all ready for the 12th state election, despite them not agreeing to the polls being called amidst the current Covid-19 situation.He said his election machinery would kick off once the Sarawak State Legislative Assembly (DUN) had been dissolved.“Nevertheless, we do admit that the state election this time would be very challenging, in view of the Covid-19 pandemic,” he said.In the 11th state election in 2016, Penguang won the seat after garnering 5,493 votes, which earned him the majority of 1,387. — Borneo Post",2021-10-25 01:22:56,,,malaymail

It is the second COVID-19 booster vaccine to be approved in the EU. “This follows data showing that a third dose of Spikevax given 6 to 8 months after the second dose led to a rise in antibody levels in adults whose antibody levels were waning,” the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said. Earlier this month, the EMA approved Pfizer-BioNTech’s booster and recommended a third dose of a shot from either Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna for people with weakened immune systems. It left EU member states to decide if the wider population should receive a booster. EMA on Monday said that the implementation of vaccination campaigns remains the prerogative of the advisory groups guiding the vaccination campaigns in each EU Member State. Under pressure to revive their economies, fight the more infectious Delta variant of the coronavirus and avoid further lockdowns in the winter, several EU member states launched their own booster campaigns before EMA guidelines. The different states have taken widely varying views on who is eligible. The EMA said the risk of inflammatory heart conditions or other very rare side effects after a booster is being monitored. U.S. authorities have authorized booster doses of Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson.

KUCHING, Oct 26 ― Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture Datuk Seri Abdul Karim Rahman Hamzah calls for no open campaign and no open rally to facilitate the next Sarawak election.“No open campaigning or no open rally does not mean that democracy is curtailed,” the Parti Pesaka Bumiputera Bersatu (PBB) vice president said.Abdul Karim pointed out that there are other ways and means candidates in election can promote themselves, especially in this digital era.“We have seen what had happened in Sabah after they held their snap state election (in September 2020),” said the Asajaya assemblyman.“In view of Sarawak having to undergo a state election soon, it is advisable for the Election Commission (or SPR) to find ways to make sure that the ‘mistakes’ made during last Sabah state election are not repeated,” he added.Abdul Karim was reacting to the latest comment by Minister of Health Khairy Jamaluddin that no election-related social gatherings or activities are allowed to facilitate the coming Melaka snap state election in order to reduce Covid-19 infection among people there.Khairy said the order is to take effect yesterday (October 25) until November 27, 2021.When contacted yesterday, Parti Rakyat Sarawak (PRS) secretary-general Dato Janang Bungsu said he agreed with Khairy.“Agree that it should be within the stipulated standard operating procedures (SOPs). After all, we are yet to come out from Covid-19 problem. Stringent SOPs must be observed to minimise physical contact,” added Janang.Progressive Democratic Party (PDP) vice president Datu Dr Penguang Manggil however said it would still be premature now to talk about SOPs for Sarawak election which is being stalled as the state is under the Emergency Order (EO) until its expiry on February 1, 2022.“The SOPs mentioned therein are for Melaka, during this given time and circumstances. It may be relevant to be imposed in Melaka but may or may not be necessary for Sarawak,” said the Assistant Minister of Housing and Local Government.“It is also too premature to talk about the SOPs as we have to know when the Emergency is to be lifted and the State Legislative Assembly (DUN) is to be dissolved.“I am pretty confident that the Ministry of Health (MoH), State Health Department, the SPR and the Sarawak Disaster Management Committee will be duly consulted and SOP formulated, taking all factors and any emerging issues before the decision to call for the PRN12 (12th Sarawak election) is made,” said Penguang, who is also Marudi assemblyman.Khairy had said in a media statement on October 24: “Based on the monitoring by the Ministry of Health, among the contributors to the increase in cases and Covid-19 clusters in the country were related to the activities of gatherings or social gatherings that did not comply with the standard operating procedures (SOPs).”The MoH expected that similar activities will take place leading up to the Melaka state election on November 20, he said.“As the risk of Covid-19 infection is still high, especially with the spread of the Delta variant in the community, and the increasing number of new Covid-19 cases which have been reported, such activities will further increase the risk of Covid-19 infection within the community,” he said.Last Monday, the SPR set November 8 as the nomination date for the Melaka state election while the voting date is November 20.Khairy explained that this ban is in line with the list of unauthorised activities (negative list) in the latest SOPs for states under Phase 4 of the National Recovery Plan (PPN).Talks are rife in Sarawak that nomination day and polling day for the state election are slated for Nov 13 and Nov 27 respectively if the Yang di-Pertuan Agong wishes to repeal the EO earlier than its expiry date. ― Borneo Post",2021-10-25 23:28:05,,,malaymail

"Australia Post, NBN pay out $300 million in bonuses during COVID",https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/australia-post-nbn-pay-out-300-million-in-bonuses-during-covid-20211025-p592yu.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_politics,,['Lisa Visentin'],,The taxpayer-owned businesses spent a total of $295.9 million on employee bonuses over the past two years.,,2021-10-25 18:00:00,"Taxpayer-owned businesses Australia Post and NBN have collectively shelled out almost $300 million in personal bonuses to employees over the past two years as the COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on businesses and families. Both companies reined in their total spending on bonus payments in the 2021 financial year, with NBN splashing $46.5 million on staff, down from $78 million in the 2020 financial year , while Australia Post rewarded employees to the tune of $79 million compared with $92 million last year . Australia Post rewarded employees to the tune of $79 million compared with $92 million last year. Credit: Ryan Stuart This amounts to $295.9 million across the two years of the pandemic, the companies’ annual reports show. Public fury prompted a government crackdown on generous executive bonuses, with the Australian Public Service Commission recently issuing updated guidance to Commonwealth entities on senior executive bonuses, saying not to pay them unless there were “exceptional circumstances or a contractual obligation”. But a spokesman for Communications Minister Paul Fletcher said the new guidance would only apply from this financial year onward, adding remuneration paid by government-owned businesses “is a matter for their respective boards”. “NBN Co and Australia Post operate in a competitive commercial environment and have to attract and retain staff with the necessary skills and expertise to manage these complex telecommunications and logistics businesses,” the spokesman said. Australia Post executives who were forced to forgo their bonuses in 2020 at the height of the pandemic’s economic crisis and amid complaints about delivery delays, had them reinstated this year. Rodney Boys, who acted as chief executive for 10 months following Christine Holgate’s controversial exit in November, earned an annual salary of $1.8 million, including a $730,438 bonus this year. In total, the postal service’s top eight executives will share in a total of $4.8 million in bonuses this year, with each also receiving a bump in base salary. For example, executive general manager Nicole Sheffield received a $100,000 pay rise this year, plus a $714,000 bonus, taking her total salary to more than $1.5 million. Labor communications spokeswoman Michelle Rowland was scathing of executive payouts. “During a period of parcel delays and broader economic distress, the Australia Post board has stuffed excessive cash bonuses into the pockets of executives,” Ms Rowland said. “This is nothing short of a slap in the face to the Australian taxpayer.” NBN Co CEO Stephen Rue had his bonus cut back by almost 40 per cent to $734,000 this year. The pay packet of NBN boss Stephen Rue, who was one of the highest-paid public executives in 2020 earning a $3.1 million salary, took a trim to $2.6 million this year as his bonus was cut back by almost 40 per cent to $734,000. NBN executives were paid bonuses in both 2020 and 2021, although most were slightly reduced this year. New Australia Post boss Paul Graham, who began in the top job last month, will be paid a base salary of $1.4 million, with the possibility to double this through bonuses. Both Mr Graham and Mr Rue will appear at a Senate estimates hearing on Tuesday. An Australia Post spokesman said over 2000 payments were to frontline workers “who have managed through extraordinary circumstances to deliver for our customers and our community”. “Remuneration is regularly benchmarked externally and must be positioned competitively to attract, motivate and retain highly skilled senior managers. It reflects their responsibilities, performance, qualifications and experience,” the spokesman said. A spokesman for NBN Co said the $46.5 million in bonuses represented 5 per cent of the company’s wages and salary costs, and was spread across 3500 employees. “It is the communities’ judgement of our performance in providing affordable access to a ubiquitous, resilient and fit-for-purpose network which informs, in part, the board’s approach to setting annual incentives. The COVID circumstances have tested NBN Co and left our customers reassured,” the spokesman said.",,smh
B.C. lifting venue capacity limits across much of the province as COVID-19 cases ease,http://www.timescolonist.com/b-c-lifting-venue-capacity-limits-across-much-of-the-province-as-covid-19-cases-ease-1.24366058,,,,"VICTORIA — British Columbia is set to lift capacity restrictions on gatherings across much of the province today.

Negros Oriental appeals Alert Level 4 status,https://www.rappler.com/nation/negros-oriental-appeals-alert-level-4-status,,['Robbin M. Dagle'],,The provincial COVID-19 isolation hospital capacity is at a critical 92% but Governor Roel Degamo says their hospitals also accommodate patients from Siquijor and southern Cebu,"Fearing more economic setbacks, the provincial government of Negros Oriental has appealed the national coronavirus task force’s decision to place the province under Alert Level 4. While the province has one of the the highest COVID-19 case rates in Central Visayas and its hospital utilization rate is in the red zone, Governor Roel Degamo announced on Monday, October 25, that he was deferring the implementation of an executive order that adopts the Alert Level 4 guidelines of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF). The province’s official page shows a 92% isolation bed capacity. In the capital Dumaguete City, all hospitals are now at critical to beyond full capacity: the government-run Negros Oriental Provincial Hospital (NOPH) at 113%, Silliman University Medical Center at 90%, Holy Child Hospital at 95%, and ACE Dumaguete Doctors at 113%. Other areas in the Visayas like Bacolod City, Iloilo province, Iloilo City, and Negros Occidental were previously placed under the Department of Health’s Alert Level 4 when their hospital capacity rates hit at least 80%. Degamo, however, said one factor for the province’s full hospitals is that they accommodate patients from neighboring provinces such as Siquijor and southern Cebu. High case rates The governor said in a Facebook video that one of the reasons for the appeal is the “decline” of cases in the province. While the number of daily new cases have slightly decreased in recent days, Negros Oriental’s number of active cases is still the highest compared to neighboring provinces in Central Visayas. The provincial health office recorded a total of 2,530 active cases as of October 25. During the provincial IATF meeting on October 20, local officials expressed concern that the “unexpected declaration” would “adversely affect local businesses and jobs,” according to a report of state-run Philippine News Agency. Negros Oriental is among the 14 pilot provinces placed under the new “alert level” system from October 20 to 31. Under the new scheme, limitations are set for high-risk establishments and activities, while the fully-vaccinated enjoy certain perks depending on the alert level.  For the national government, the new scheme is supposed to be more relaxed than the old community quarantine system, as it allows full operation of less risky establishments and “non-essential” activities even underAlert Level 4. But recently, governors have also asked the national IATF for more time to study the new guidelines. Vaccination rates in Negros Oriental may also complicate the implementation of the alert level system, which has specific conditions that require full inoculation of employees in certain establishments such as restaurants, barbershops, salons, and spas. As of October 25, 163,264 residents in Negros Oriental have been fully vaccinated. This is only 17% of the 908,939 total target population of people 18 and above, and 11.3% of the province’s total population of 1.43 million. Staffing problems Degamo also appealed to the Department of Health to help the province augment hospitals’ manpower. He said that hospitals have already limited their COVID-19 beds due to the lack of healthcare workers. Dr. Liland Estacion, incident commander of the provincial IATF, said in a virtual press briefing that there were 20 vacancies for nurses in the government-run NOPH, but nobody wants to apply. “How can we accommodate people, how can we serve people nga kulang man kaayo? And then, that’s the reason why magka-COVID na kay sobra sobra na kaayo ang ratio of one nurse to a patient,” Estacion said on October 25. (How can we accommodate people, how can we serve people if we lack people? The reason why our healthcare workers get COVID is that the ratio of one nurse to a patient is too high.) “I’m now calling the deans of the school of nursing, naa’y daghang nipasar (many have passed the board exam), where are they now? Please do help our community,” she said.  Vice Governor Mark Macias earlier posted pictures of COVID patients stationed at the NOPH parking lot, as isolation facilities and beds inside were already full. – Rappler.com",2021-10-26 02:50:23,"Fearing more economic setbacks, the provincial government of Negros Oriental has appealed the national coronavirus task force's decision to place the province under Alert Level 4.

Eight things we learned from the Facebook Papers,https://www.theverge.com/22740969/facebook-files-papers-frances-haugen-whistleblower-civic-integrity,,['Russell Brandom'],,,"A massive new document release shows chaos and confusion inside the world’s most powerful social network For months, Facebook has been shaken by a steady leak of documents from whistleblower Frances Haugen, beginning in The Wall Street Journal but spreading to government officials and nearly any outlet with an interest in the company. Now, those documents are going much more public, giving us the most sweeping look at the operations of Facebook anyone not directly involved with the company has ever had. The documents stem from disclosures made to the SEC and provided to Congress by Haugen in redacted form. The Verge and a consortium of other news organizations have obtained redacted versions of the documents, which we’re calling The Facebook Papers. In order to receive the documents, we agreed to begin publishing our reporting on them this week, but we are not beholden to report on them in a certain way or coordinate what we cover with other outlets. We’ve already done some reporting on the files, and we’ll keep reporting on them over the coming weeks. (There are a lot of pages.) This isn’t a comprehensive list of everything in the documents, and you should fully expect more to come out. Instead, think of it as a summary of the files that, so far, have stood out to us the most. Hopefully, it will help you make sense of the sheer volume of Facebook news coming out this morning. Facebook was caught off guard by vaccine misinformation in comments Facebook has taken a lot of criticism for its handling of COVID misinformation — including from President Biden, who accused the platform of “killing people” by letting anti-vaxx sentiment run amok — but the leaks show just how chaotic the effort was inside the company. One document dated March 2021 shows an employee raising the alarm about how unprepared the platform was. “Vaccine hesitancy in comments is rampant,” the memo reads. “Our ability to detect vaccine-hesitant comments is bad in English, and basically non-existent elsewhere. We need Policy guidelines specifically aimed at vaccine hesitancy in comments.” (Editor’s note: We are not publishing the document itself since it contains the full name of a Facebook employee.) “Comments are a significant portion of misinfo on FB,” says another employee in an internal comment, “and are almost a complete blind spot for us in terms of enforcement and transparency right now.” “For English posts on Vaccines, vaccine hesitancy prevalence among comments is 50 percent.” The document makes clear that Facebook already had a “COVID-19 lockdown defense” project dedicated to the platform dynamics created by the pandemic, including a workstream dedicated entirely to vaccine hesitancy. That team had also created significant automated flagging systems for misinformation — but according to the files, those simply weren’t being used to downrank anti-vaccine comments. As of the March memo, there were no plans to develop moderation infrastructure like labeling, guidelines, and classifier systems to identify anti-vaccine statements in comments. The failure to meaningfully moderate comments was noticed outside the company. A First Draft News study in May looked at the comments for a handful of major news outlets with more than a million followers and found one in five comments on vaccine-related stories contained some kind of anti-vaccine misinformation. The documents show Facebook was aware of the problem, and First Draft may have even underestimated the issue. One comment on the post reads, “for English posts on Vaccines, vaccine hesitancy prevalence among comments is 50 percent.” Other aspects of the issue remained completely unstudied since the company had yet to dig in on the comment problem. “We currently don’t understand whether Group comments are a serious problem,” the post argues. “It’s clear to us that the ‘good post, bad comment’ problem is a big deal, but it’s not necessarily as clear that [vaccine hesitant] comments on [vaccine hesitant] posts are additive to the harm.” Another document published shortly after April 2021 shows the company still coming to terms with vaccine misinformation. The good news was that there was no evidence of a foreign influence campaign driving anti-vaxx sentiment, as had stung the company in 2016. But the vast majority of content was being sent by a relatively small portion of accounts, suggesting that Facebook had not yet taken the easiest measures to address the issue. Facebook has taken some steps recently to address misinformation in comments — including new downranking rules from just last week. But these documents show those changes came more than six months after the alarm had been raised internally and after Facebook had publicly expressed anxiety about the impending leak. Given the huge surge of COVID deaths among vaccine-skeptical populations over the past three months, it’s easy to see the recent changes as too little, too late. Apple threatened to ban Facebook over online “slave markets” Facebook scrambled to address human trafficking content after Apple threatened to kick its apps off the iOS App Store, a leaked SEV (or Site Event) report shows. The report, referenced briefly by The Wall Street Journal’s Facebook Files reporting, indicates that Apple threatened to pull Facebook and Instagram from iOS on October 23rd of 2019. Apple had been tipped off by a BBC News Arabic report that found domestic workers being sold via Instagram and other apps, where sellers encouraged buyers to mistreat the workers by doing things such as confiscating their passports. the policy was “highly likely leading to exploitation of domestic servants” Facebook had been aware of the problem but hadn’t understood the scope of it, apparently because very little content (less than 2 percent of the material it found) had been reported by users. “Removing our applications from Apple platforms would have had potentially severe consequences to the business,” the Facebook report notes. After Apple escalated the issue, Facebook moderators swept the platforms for keywords and hashtags mentioned in the BBC reporting, ultimately disabling 1,021 accounts and removing 129,121 pieces of content. Facebook also removed a policy exception letting established brick and mortar businesses like recruitment agencies post ads about domestic workers. Facebook determined that even if the businesses were legal, the policy was “highly likely leading to exploitation of domestic servants.” Apple was apparently satisfied with the mitigation measures, and the incident was closed within a week. The Civic Integrity team was often directly blocked by Zuckerberg One of the most alarming incidents uncovered by the papers was that Mark Zuckerberg personally intervened to ensure Facebook would comply with a repressive law instituted in Vietnam, agreeing to moderate more aggressively against “anti-state” content on the platform. The anecdote leads The Washington Post’s report on the papers and plays into a much more troubling dynamic described by Haugen before Congress. Facebook’s Integrity team had lots of ideas for how to make Facebook less harmful, but they were usually overruled, sometimes by Zuckerberg himself. Bloomberg News explores the issue in more detail, showing how the company often found its own efforts to downrank harmful content overwhelmed by the content’s inherent virality. As one employee put it, “I worry that Feed is becoming an arms race.” Politico highlights another employee quote showing just how demoralized the team had become. “If we really want to change the state of our information ecosystem, we need a revolution, not an evolution of our systems,” an employee wrote in October 2019. “If you don’t have enough good content to boost, it doesn’t matter how much you downrank the bad.” Facebook used a German anti-vaccine movement as a test case for more aggressive moderation Another document details Facebook’s so-called “Querdenken experiment,” in which the company’s moderators tested out a more aggressive moderation approach on a German conspiracy movement. Facebook’s Dangerous Content team was already developing a new classification — a “harmful topic community” — and the growing Querdenken was chosen as an experiment on how the classification would work in practice. As a Facebook employee writes in the document, “this could be a good case study to inform how we tackle these problems in the future” “this could be a good case study to inform how we tackle these problems in the future” Querdenken has become one of the leading anti-lockdown and anti-vaccination groups in Germany, with similarities to more extreme groups like QAnon. As the Facebook proposal framed it, the Querdenken movement had potential for violence but wasn’t yet linked to extreme enough activity that would justify banning followers from the platform entirely. The documents give few details about how the experiment proceeded, although clearly, some version of the Querdenken plan was implemented. (A later report says “results from some initial samples look promising.”) And judging by the company’s public statements, it did result in a meaningful change to moderation policy: in September, Facebook announced a new policy on “coordinated social harm,” specifically citing Querdenken as an example of the new approach in action. Unlike many of the other documents, the Querdenken experiment shows Facebook’s moderation system as relatively effective. The company identified the group before it caused significant harm, took action with an eye towards long-term consequences and was transparent about the policy shift after it took place. But the incident shows how complex the interplay of policy and enforcement can be, with broader policies often rewritten with an eye towards specific groups. And for supporters of Querdenken, it may be alarming to learn that the rules of the world’s largest social platform were rewritten specifically to keep their movement from gaining public support. Facebook’s January 6th response was shaped by glitches and delays Facebook discussed developing extreme “break-glass measures” to limit misinformation, calls to violence, and other material that could disrupt the 2020 presidential election. But when former President Donald Trump and his supporters tried to stop successor Joe Biden from being declared president on January 6th, 2021, Facebook employees complained these measures were implemented too late or stymied by technical and bureaucratic hangups. Reports at Politico and The New York Times outline Facebook’s struggle to handle users delegitimizing the elections. Internally, critics said Facebook didn’t have a sufficient game plan for “harmful non-violating narratives” that toed the line between misinformation and content Facebook wants to preserve as free speech. And some plans, like a change that would have prevented Groups from changing their names to terms like “Stop the Steal,” apparently got held up by technical problems. Facebook was trying to rebalance its News Feed for “civic health” The Wall Street Journal first revealed that news outlets and political parties had complained about users favoring negative and hyperbolic content. Facebook was considering ways to fix the problem, and one method involved re-weighting the News Feed to optimize for “civic health” instead of primarily focusing on meaningful social interactions or session time. In a product briefing called “Ranking For Civic Health,” Facebook acknowledged that “people think that political content on Facebook is low quality, untrustworthy, and divisive,” and the current ranking system was “not creating a wholly valuable civic experience for users.” (Based on document comment dates, the document was produced around January and February of 2020.) “people think that political content on Facebook is low quality, untrustworthy, and divisive” The document says Facebook’s ranking algorithm recommended civic content that users themselves didn’t report finding valuable — something earlier leaks have indicated was a problem with meaningful social interactions (MSI) and other engagement-based metrics. “Our current ranking objectives do not optimize for integrity outcomes, which can have dangerous consequences,” it says — for instance, MSI optimization was “contributing hugely to Civic misinfo,” and Facebook estimated that removing it from Civic posts would decrease it by 30 to 50 percent. Facebook tried to improve civic health by asking users explicitly what they thought constituted good civic content. This sometimes revealed even bigger problems — since Facebook apparently found that 20 to 30 percent of respondents “may say that known Civic hate is ‘good for the community’” in surveys. Facebook settled on a strategy to “prioritize the reduction of policy-violating content — such as Civic Hate or Civic Misinfo — even if the individual user finds it valuable” and aimed to reduce the prevalence of civic hate speech, misinformation, and inflammatory content by at least 10 percent. The company ran rebalancing experiments in February 2020 by slightly increasing the amount of “civic” News Feed content that a random set of users saw, then optimizing that content through different metrics (including MSI and whether people thought content was “worth your time”). It also ran a survey to collect how users felt about civic News Feed content. The company aimed to have a new optimization system chosen by March of 2020 — although it’s not clear how the coronavirus pandemic may have changed those plans. Why likes were never hidden on Facebook and Instagram A highly publicized plan from early last year to hide like counts on Instagram never happened because testing the change hurt ad revenue and led to people using the app less. A quiet test of the experience on the Facebook app was also killed after leadership told Zuckerberg that it wasn’t a “top barrier to sharing nor a top concern for people.” A lengthy internal presentation to Zuckerberg about the plan, dubbed Project Daisy, shows that there were concerns among leadership about how the Facebook app would have been perceived if Instagram hid like counts and Facebook did not, which is something employees who were involved in the project have told The Verge. Employees working on Instagram wanted to bill it as a way to depressurize the app for young people, but the team working on the Facebook app wasn’t into the idea. If Instagram went through with hiding likes, the presentation details how leadership at Facebook wanted to “minimize blowback to the Facebook app” for not hiding them and still “ensure credit ladders up to the Facebook company.” Instead of hiding likes for all users by default as was originally planned, Instagram earlier adopted a half measure by letting people opt into hiding their likes. Facebook’s “civic groups” policy stumbled over a simple design flaw In October 2020, Facebook announced that it would stop recommending civic and political groups to users in the US as part of a broader effort to avoid the mistakes of the 2016 election. (The policy was made permanent shortly after the January 6th riot.) But actually keeping those groups out of Facebook recommendation feeds has been a huge challenge for the company — and an internal document gives us new insight into why. The document shows Facebook employees grappling with a public article, flagged by the PR team, which found 30 separate groups still appearing in recommendation feeds in apparent violation of the policy. Escalated on January 19th, the document says many of the groups named in the report had been labeled as civic groups at one point — but were somehow still being recommended as part of facebook’s Groups You Should Join feature. Reducing churn could have solved almost all of the problems “Leakage has been there since Nov 2020 at the least,” the Facebook document reads. It’s not clear which article the document is referring to, but there were a number of reports spotting enforcement failures at the time. The Markup found a bunch of groups slipping through that January and again in June. Even now, it’s not clear the civic groups policy is being enforced as intended. At the time, most observers focused on the conceptual difficulty: it’s a hard philosophical problem to draw a clear line between which groups count as “civic” and even harder to scale it across a platform of Facebook’s size. But the internal report shows the real problem was much simpler. Facebook’s monitoring system (referred to in the report as “Laser”) had been trained to only look at the past seven days of content when determining whether a page fell into the “civic groups” category, which meant pages were constantly filtering in and out as the period viewed by the algorithm changed. In practice, that meant a pro-Trump or pro-Biden group could easily dodge the label by posting a few days worth of less obviously political content. The report estimates that a full 12 percent of labeled groups would churn out of the category from day to day. According to the report, 90 percent of the groups highlighted by the article had been caught by Facebook’s existing “civic groups” classifier — but they’d filtered out as part of the churn. So reducing churn alone could have solved almost all of the problems spotted by the report. There have been lots of stories like this over the past five years: Facebook sets a policy that seems measured and responsible, but a cursory test (usually from a journalist) shows banned content is still easily slipping through. From the outside, it’s often unclear how much of the problem is incompetence at Facebook and how much is just the inherent difficulty of managing a platform of that size. But in this case, the documents put the blame squarely on Facebook as a company. This was a high-profile policy with huge stakes for the country at large, with obvious delicacy in how it was implemented. A churn rate that high made it inevitable that targeted groups would slip through the cracks, and the company simply didn’t notice until reporters called them out.",2021-10-25 15:40:19,,,theverge

Horgan says the majority of health-care workers are immunized and often perplexed about why others wouldn't follow the science behind vaccination and the advice of provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry. The vaccine mandate will apply to everyone who works in health-care settings, including students, doctors, contractors and volunteers. Those who don't have their first dose by the deadline can't work unless they have a recognized medical exemption. Workers who get their first shot before Nov. 15 can resume working seven days after the first dose, but they must wear personal protective equipment and take other precautions until they have their second dose, which must be no more than 35 days after the initial dose. Staff at long-term care homes and assisted living facilities needed to be fully vaccinated by Oct. 12. British Columbia is reporting 1,618 new cases of COVID-19, 20 deaths and five new health-care facility outbreaks over the last three days.

Used car market likely to enjoy continued growth,https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/2204155/used-car-market-likely-to-enjoy-continued-growth,,,,"Thailand's used car market is expected to continue growing, thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic which boosted its growth to 20-30%, said the Association of Used Cars.",,2021-10-25 21:00:00,"Thailand's used car market is expected to continue growing, thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic which boosted its growth to 20-30%, said the Association of Used Cars. The used car market recorded a 10% growth on yearly average before the pandemic hit Thailand at the beginning of 2020. ""Normally the used car market grows slowly. Around 1-2 million cars are sold each year,"" said Pinyo Tanawatcharaporn, president of the Association of Used Cars. Second-hand car sales are usually one time higher than the sales of new cars. The pandemic alerted people to the chance of catching the highly contagious virus on public transport, causing many of them to buy cars, said Mr Pinyo. Second-hand cars are more attractive to people who cannot afford to buy new cars with higher price tags. Among used cars are those from motorists who could not pay instalments during the pandemic and saw them seized by creditors, including banks and financial institutions, though they are still in good condition. Average prices of used cars are 30-40% lower than those of new cars. ""The used car market is taking advantage of the government's lockdown easing and its plan to reopen Thailand. These factors have created good sentiments among prospective car buyers,"" said Mr Pinyo. Drastic lockdown approaches, including strict travel restrictions and a night-time curfew, which were enforced early last year, caused a drop in second-hand car prices, but the situation has bottomed out leading to a growth in the used car market, he said. Kasikorn Research Center expects second-hand car prices to go up by 5.5-7.5% this year due mainly to the pandemic's impact. The increase will be even higher in used car markets overseas. However, the prices will not sharply increase partly because of more supply of used cars seized by financial institutions from owners who failed to pay instalments, said Kasikorn Research Center. Consumers' lower purchasing power and banks' strict criteria to grant car loans also curbed the price increase. Kasikorn Research Center expects used car prices will continue to increase next year due to the recovery of purchasing power in the business sector, leading to more demand for used vehicles, especially trucks. Better business prospects for new car sales are also expected as the Federation of Thai Industries' automotive club believes car production will grow beyond the target of 1.6 million units this year amid falling Covid-19 infections and an easing of the semiconductor shortage situation. The bright business prospects come after the easing of lockdown in many countries and a greater supply of computer chips, according to the club. The Covid-19 situation is now better than it has been in months, resulting in a boost to business confidence and people's purchasing power, said Surapong Paisitpatanapong, vice-chairman and spokesman for the FTI's automotive club. The car production target for 2021 was earlier set at 1.55-1.6 million units, with 800,000-850,000 units to be exported. From January to September, domestic car production increased by 25.6% year-on-year to 1,211,946 units, according to the club. Though car production in September dropped by 6.43% year-on-year to 140,038 units, production prospects are expected to get better.",,bangkokpost

A ccording to two of the country’s leading paranormal investigation groups, Ireland ranks among the highest in the world for paranormal activity. Some of Ireland’s spookiest sites include Kilmainhan Gaol in Dublin, Loftus Hall in Wexford, Ross Castle in Meath and Spike Island in Cork, as well as Charleville and Leap Castles in Offaly. Paranormal investigators consider that, on a per capita basis, Offaly ranks as the most haunted county in Ireland. Irish Paranormal Investigations (IPI) official Ann Massey said reports of increased activity had included a surging number of contacts from the public about unexplained occurrences in people’s homes, not just known haunted houses and castles. Read More ‘Hospitals are at full tilt’: Urgent demand to give health workers the booster jab It is believed the traumatic impact on society of the world’s worst pandemic since the 1918 Spanish Flu has somehow heightened contacts between the living and spirit worlds. Ms Massey said such ‘step-over’ activity between the human and spirit worlds was common in times of societal trauma such as wars and pandemics. “From our perspective as a group we have been getting a lot more contact from people – especially in their private houses,” she said. “It is twofold – more people are more aware of what is going on around them now and noticing these step-overs from the spirit realm.

The IPI team includes Ms Massey, Dominic McElroy, Liam Canty and up to three others. Their investigations range from measuring physical, electrical and temperature changes through to examining the history and even archaeology of an area. Most haunted houses have exploited their paranormal legends with successful commercial offerings ranging from ghost tours to Halloween parties. Leap Castle even offers a special evening meal dubbed ‘Dining with the Dead’. However, the most feared site in Ireland is the Hellfire Club located at Montpelier Hill in Dublin. Built as a hunting lodge, legend has it the structure disturbed an ancient burial site – and has been troubled by angry spirits ever since. But its dark reputation dates from the mid-18th century when it was rumoured to have been used by the Hellfire Club, a group of dissolute nobles, for parties. Such was the behaviour of the group that it was even rumoured the building hosted ‘black masses’ – and that at each dinner a chair was deliberately left empty in case Satan decided to attend. Ms Massey said paranormal activity noted at the Hellfire Club had even extended to the estate grounds and woods. She said such was Ireland’s rich folklore history that almost every part of the country had stories of hauntings and supernatural activity. “Just like history has layers, so does supernatural activity,” she said. Ms Massey said her favourite investigation sites in Ireland were Dundrum, Tipperary and Cork’s Spike Island. “Prisons are places where there can be a lot of paranormal activity,” she said. Co-founder of Paranormal Supernatural Investigations Ireland (PSI), Richard Morrison (42), said Ireland was noted on an international scale for its residual energy and paranormal activity. “I think Ireland is up there in the top two at least, even as paranormal researchers we’re amazed. “We find that 95pc of the evidence that we capture is after the investigation from our appointment that’s gathered the evidence. “It’s very rarely something will happen visually, it’s our equipment that’s capturing all this. Ireland has a lot of history and the energy here is very active for paranormal researching. “We believe the whole land itself has got a lot of residual energy,” he said. Mr Morrison said the group preferred not to be referred to as ‘ghost hunters’; he said they researched locations that they believed had residual energy. “We research an area, analyse our evidence and see if we can back up any of the claims that the place is spiritually haunted,” he said. Mr Morrison has had personal experiences with paranormal activity since he was a young child. “My great-grandfather passed away during an operation. I always remember I asked, ‘Would you ever visit me, Granddad, if you died?’ and his exact words were, ‘Of course I’d come and visit you’. “He went in for a routine operation and he sadly passed away. A few nights after his death I woke up and for some reason my head was drawn to my bedside table, I remember seeing this luminous green outline of a person and I got the feeling that I knew that was my grandfather. “I was only six. Children are very open, they have their third eye and they’re very spiritually connected. “They can see things that maybe adults can’t see and as we get older, we tend to close that spiritual side of us. The second night that same incident happened again. “Then, when I was 15 I saw the same figure was standing at the bottom of my bed. I ran into my parents’ bedroom and told them. “My parents always told me it was a dream.” He went on: “It is nice to share the evidence that we’ve been gathering with people. Some people will always be sceptical and that’s the way human nature is. The way we work we just put the evidence out there and we let people decide for themselves.” Mr Morrison said the Galway-based group recently captured a photo of a ghostly figure in the window of Moore Hall in Co Mayo. “The image is as clear as day,” he said. “There’s no inside stairs or floors, it’s a complete shell of a house. “We love to go investigate these places because we research the history of the location.” Read More ‘Hospitals are at full tilt’: Urgent demand to give health workers the booster jab",https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/23eb4/40980812.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/atural%20Galway%2019543.jpg,independent
