Musician Arturo Fermill, also known as D.J. Buddha Sax, says the demand of his services has only declined since the province’s announcement that capacity limits would be lifted. “I would usually have, in normal times, twenty to thirty gigs booked for Christmas parties, corporate events, even winter weddings right up until Christmas Eve but I currently have one that’s a ‘maybe,’ which will be eventually be cancelled due to the fact that their employees aren’t able to dance on the dance floor.” Story continues below advertisement Fermill believes the province underestimated how much revenue would be lost by B.C. small businesses when they chose to leave ‘indoor event dancing’ off the list of activities that were now allowed. “We now need the government to not have this oversight, because it really is an oversight.” Read more: B.C. lifting COVID-19 capacity limits on gatherings for much of province Micheal Ghirra, who is the owner of Riverside Banquet Halls, said the no-dancing rules and mask mandate have continued to dry up his business as well. “The announcement was great that we are at 100 per cent capacity at our banquet halls, but nothing has really changed with our businesses and our clients — they’re still not booking,” said Ghirra. “With Christmas parties, we typically do about 30 to 35 corporate events a year, but this year we’re down to, like, six — and out of those six, we just got a call last week that, because of the no-dancing and indoor-masking rules, that they’re just going to postpone until next year.” Meanwhile, Connolly is asking the province to make a decision this week on whether dancing will be allowed and the indoor-mask mandate lifted for indoor events so event organizers and staff can plan accordingly for the holiday season.

Ministry of Health pointed to earlier comments made by Dr. Bonnie Henry last week, highlighting her response to dancing not being allowed at live event venues. “We are watching that carefully and I hope to be able to take off more restrictions as we get through the next few months,” Henry had said at last Tuesday’s press conference. Although Connolly said she would prefer if both the indoor-mask mandate and dancing restrictions were lifted, there is one that would allow her businesses to thrive more. “If I had to pick one or the other, I would definitely say let us dance.” © 2021 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.",https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CP127988159.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=720&h=480&crop=1,globalnews

"Right food can help beat depression, say nutritionists",https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/health/right-food-can-help-beat-depression-say-nutritionists-329914,,,,"Hyderabad, October 26 Eating the right food can help beat depression effectively during difficult times, say nutritionists. Troubles linked to personal health, family situation, financial condition, and any other issue which might trigger despair during Covid-19 pandemic is likely to result in causing mental depression among those facing these situations. The common belief is that people when depressed tend to consume food in excess. However, nutritionists say eating the right food will also help people overcome depression. A Lancet report recently indicated that more and more people are suffering from depression related problems due to the after-effects of Covid-19 pandemic. Commenting on linkage between food and depression, Dr N. Malleshwari, Chief Dietician amp; Nutritionist, Gleneagles Global Hospital said: ""Poor food choices and selection of foods might contribute to deficiency of the nutrients which actually can result in depression. Some amino acids like tryptophan, tyrosine, methionine, and phenylalanine are often helpful in treating many mild disorders including depression."" Mental depression is a serious problem that affects people around the world, and in many, this could be a life changing occurrence. ""While those who accept they are depressed, seek medical attention or counselling to overcome the condition, the best means to beat depression is to bring about lifestyle changes and start consuming a healthy diet. While medicines or counselling provide temporary relief, eating right food and bringing in positive lifestyle changes will help conquer the problem forever. Omega 3 fatty acids (EPA amp; DHA) elicit anti-depressant effects among humans and are very important to be included in diet,"" said Malleshwari. ""Human bodies normally produce molecules which are called free radicals which could lead to cell damage resulting in quick ageing and cause other problems. Consuming antioxidants-rich foods and vitamins-rich fruits and vegetables will have a positive impact on the brain and certainly lessen the destructive effects of free radicals. Foods like carrots, pumpkin, spinach, oranges, tomato, nuts and seeds, will be of great help,"" said Dr Arun Kumar, Chief Dietitian, SLG Hospitals. Swetha, HoD - Nutrition, Aware Gleneagles Global Hospital believes that eating small portions of proteins several times in a day will help boost energy in the human body and will clear the mind. ""Protein-rich tuna fish, turkey, chicken have amino acids which help the human body stay alert. Beans, peas, milk, soya, yogurt too are a good source of healthy proteins. People who are suffering from depression must ensure they do not consume alcohol, or smoke, and even cut down on caffeine intake to overcome the problem."" Overweight or obese people are more likely to suffer from depression because excess body weight will impact immune system and bring hormonal changes among both men and women. Obese individuals must immediately work on cutting down weight if they intend to overcome depression, and healthy food habits are a first step in that direction. Many people who are depressed also have problems with alcohol or drugs; and these not only can interfere with mood, sleep, and motivation, they can also reduce the effectiveness of depression medications.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Moderna said Monday that a low dose of its COVID-19 vaccine is safe and appears to work in 6- to 11-year-olds, as the manufacturer joins its rival Pfizer in moving toward expanding shots to children. Pfizer's kid-size vaccine doses are closer to widespread use. They are undergoing evaluation by the Food and Drug Administration for youngsters in nearly the same age group, 5 to 11, and could be available by early November. The company's vaccine already is authorized for anyone 12 or older. Moderna hasn't yet gotten the go-ahead to offer its vaccine to teens but is studying lower doses in younger children while it waits.

( Paul Hennessy/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) CHINA TO GIVE COVID VACCINE TO CHILDREN AS YOUNG AS 3 Researchers tested two shots for the 6- to 11-year-olds, given a month apart, that each contained half the dose given to adults. Preliminary results showed vaccinated children developed virus-fighting antibodies similar to levels that young adults produce after full-strength shots, Moderna said in a news release. The study involved 4,753 children ages 6 to 11 who got either the vaccine or dummy shots. Moderna said that like adults, the vaccinated youngsters had temporary side effects, including fatigue, headache, fever and injection site pain. The study was too small to spot any extremely rare side effects, such as heart inflammation that sometimes occurs after either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines, mostly among young men. Dr. Salma Elfaki holds a vial of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at a Moderna clinical trial for adolescents being conducted by Accel Research Sites with Nona Pediatric Center in Orlando, Florida. (Paul Hennessy/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Moderna released no further details and hasn't submitted its data to a scientific journal but said it plans to share the interim results with the FDA and global regulators soon. The study is still going on, and the company cannot calculate the vaccine's effectiveness in actually preventing infections in children unless there are sufficient COVID-19 cases to compare rates between vaccinated and unvaccinated participants. The FDA hasn’t yet ruled on the company’s application to expand its vaccinations to 12- to 17-year-olds, although some countries have cleared Moderna’s shots for adolescents. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But the U.S. is expected to begin vaccinating children under 12 sometime next month, if the FDA clears low doses of the Pfizer vaccine for 5- to 11-year-olds. Pfizer reported last week that its kid-size doses proved nearly 91% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 in that age group, even as the extra-contagious delta variant was spreading widely. FDA's advisers will weigh Pfizer's evidence in a public meeting Tuesday. If the agency authorizes Pfizer's kid shots, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the following week is set to recommend who should receive them.",https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/10/modernavaccinekids.jpg,foxnews

""Our findings, which show superior cognitive performance among women over 50 who had breastfed, suggest that breastfeeding may be ‘neuroprotective’ later in life,"" she added. The study , titled, ""Women who breastfeed exhibit cognitive benefits after age 50,"" asserts that breastfeeding’s biological effects and psychosocial effects, such as improved stress regulation, could exert long-term benefits for the mother’s brain. ""Because breastfeeding has also been found to help regulate stress, promote infant bonding and lower the risk of post-partum depression, which suggest acute neurocognitive benefits for the mother, we suspected that it could also be associated with long-term superior cognitive performance for the mother as well,"" Fox said. Participants in the study, all women over 50 years old, completed a comprehensive battery of psychological tests measuring learning, delayed recall, executive functioning and processing speed.

Amanda Shoultz, 29, struggled with mysterious weight gain that was later diagnosed as a massive tumor, according to a recent report. Shoultz first noticed she was gaining weight early in the year, so she started dieting and working out more, but kept gaining more weight around her stomach. During her annual checkup this February, she resolved she would lose 10 pounds because, ""I just assumed it was my fault. That I had done something wrong,"" she told the news outlet. Her doctor checked routine blood work, but when everything came back normal, she thought she had an undiagnosed food allergy that was causing excessive bloating, so she started experimenting with her diet , but nothing helped stop the weight gain, according to the report. After almost eight months of not improving, she was referred to a gastroenterologist. ""By the time I saw my GI [gastroenterologist] doctor, my stomach was hard as a rock,"" she recalled. ""My mom said you could have punched me in my stomach and broken your hand it was so hard."" The doctor immediately did a full workup, including a CT scan, which revealed a nearly 13-inch, 17-pound tumor in her abdomen called a liposarcoma that also wrapped around her right kidney and adrenal gland. On Sept. 27, she had surgery to remove the tumor, along with her right kidney and part of her adrenal gland, but because it had not spread anywhere else, she didn’t have to go through any chemotherapy or radiation, according to the report. She didn’t feel much pain, other than the discomfort of weight gain, which is typical of the cancer’s early presentation . Liposarcoma is a malignant tumor of the fatty tissue that can start anywhere in the body, but most commonly starts in the thigh, behind the knee or behind the belly, according to the American Cancer Society . She shared her story on social media to inspire patients to literally follow your gut. ""I knew that something was wrong because I've always had a hard time gaining weight,"" Shoultz said. ""When I was getting so large in my abdomen and I couldn't control it, that's when I knew something was off."" ""We preach it at the hospital, don't die of doubt,"" she noted. ""No one else is going to need to fight for you, so fight for yourself and find a care team that is going to care for you through the journey.""",https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/12/542d5766-patient_resized.jpg,foxnews

Stockton triathlon joins Newcastle events list for 2022,https://www.newcastleherald.com.au/story/7480600/stockton-triathlon-joins-newcastle-events-list-for-2022/?src=rss,,['Renee Valentine'],,It will be staged next February.,,2021-10-24 22:30:00,"Event-starved Novocastrians may have been celebrating last week with news of a new running race for the community calendar. I use the word race loosely because for many it will merely be a chance to test themselves after months of lockdown and a barren stretch of cancelled event after cancelled event. Signing up for a fitness event is a fantastic way to add some motivation to your training program. It gives you a clear goal and time frame to work with. You can gradually increase your training workload over time to the distance you have entered. For first-timers this may be geared around just completing the course. For the more experienced a personal best time might be the focus. H Events announced last week they would host Recovery Run Newcastle around the harbour foreshore on November 14. Distances on offer are five kilometres and 10km but entrants must be double vaccinated against coronavirus. The course is flat and a good entry point for those who may have taken up running or walking during lockdown life. You could test yourself on the flat then look for a further challenge in the new year with NewRun's Herald Hill2Harbour 10km on April 3 next year. Recovery Run Newcastle is not the only new event to hit the city's shores. H Events will also stage a triathlon, to be supported by City of Newcastle, at Stockton in February next year. The annual Sparke Helmore Newcastle City Tri around the Newcastle harbour foreshore is usually held in February but has been rescheduled until November next year. H Events director Paul Humphreys said the move opened up the opportunity to offer a triathlon in Stockton in February instead. The Stockton event will be held over three days from February 4 to 6, starting with a fun run on the Friday evening, an aquathlon (swim and run) on the Saturday morning and two triathlon events on the Sunday. They will be a sprint distance course of 750-metre swim, 20km bike and 5km run, and an Olympic course with all distances doubled. ""We're making it a three-day festival,"" Mr Humphreys said. ""It's a flat course, so the sprint distance should suit novices, but there is something for all levels."" Flat means fast for the diehards as well as a comfortable introduction to triathlon for beginners. The beauty of triathlon events is that you can do them solo or in a team. My first triathlon was as part of a team with a work colleague. I did the swim and run leg with a welcome rest in between cheering him through the bike leg. It gave me the confidence to go back the following couple of years and try the full event on my own, albeit the shortest course available. It is just over three months away, which provides ample time to train up for the swim, cycle or run, or perhaps all three. Send your health and fitness news to r.valentine@newcastleherald.com.au.

Dorset Council reveals £37.5m plan for children with additional needs,https://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/news/19671722.dorset-council-reveals-37-5m-plan-children-additional-needs/?ref=rss,,,,DORSET Council has revealed how it is spending £37.5m of funding earmarked to improve the lives of children with additional needs - including the creation of new schools.,,2021-10-26 04:00:00,"READ MORE: Dorset Council's new £37.5m plan for children with additional needs The council developed the plans in response to the growing need for more special educational provision - with young people with Education, Health and Care Plans in Dorset nearly doubling between 2015 and 2020. Currently some children and young people with SEND must travel a great distance for educational provision, sometimes outside of the county, because there's not enough specialist provision available in Dorset. The council's roadmap to deliver the programme includes a scheme to open the Dorset Centre of Excellence – a new school in Shaftesbury based on the former St Mary's site to open with an initial 60 additional places in the 2021/22 academic year, with further phasing as it seeks to achieve 280 places in total over the subsequent years. The council is also working towards opening an additional site for Wimborne's Beaucroft Special School – which will bring approximately 75 additional places in 2022/23. The investment is also set to go towards the expansion of Inclusion Hubs across Dorset which will provide provision attached to mainstream schools. It is hoped that Inclusion Hubs will support children with SEND so that they can access the mainstream classroom, but also allow space to support children when they need more specialist support. The move expects to achieve an expansion of over 100 places over the next 5 years. Independent provision costs around £60,000 a year per child, whereas high quality provision at one of Dorset's own special schools costs around £22,000 a year per child. The SEND Capital Strategy aims to increase local provision and reduce some of these costs in the longer term. Cllr Andrew Parry, Dorset Council Portfolio Holder for Children, Education and Early Help, said; “Dorset Council is making a big investment in education and support for children with SEND and it’s of huge importance to us. We've developed these ambitious plans because the need for more SEND provision is growing fast and we want all our children and young people to have the best possible outcomes – to thrive. “This bold and ambitious strategy will focus on achieving the best education for all Dorset’s children and young people with SEND, while avoiding the need for a child to travel away from their family and friend networks to receive their education or support.” CONTACT ME: t: 01305 830999 e: marie-claire.alfonso @newsquest.co.uk twitter: @MCAlfonsoJourno",https://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/resources/images/13137168/,dorsetecho

"Walmart recalls room spray for ""rare and dangerous"" bacteria",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/deadly-bacteria-room-spray-walmart-recall/,,,,CDC urges consumers not to even open recalled bottles and use gloves in returning them to the retailer.,,2021-10-25 12:13:20,"Walmart is recalling room spray sold nationwide due to the possible presence of what federal regulators called a ""rare and dangerous"" bacteria that is linked to two deaths, including a child. The retailer sold about 3,900 bottles of Better Homes and Gardens-branded-Essential Oil Infused Aromatherapy Room Spray with Gemstones in six different scents, according to a recall notice posted Friday by the Consumer Protection Safety Commission. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tested a sample of the product this week and found it contained the bacteria Burkholderia pseudomallei, which causes melioidosis, a rare but serious disease with about a dozen cases reportedly annually in the U.S. The recall comes two months after the CDC warned the bacterial disease had caused two deaths and urged doctors to be on the lookout for more cases. Consumers are urged not to use — or even open — the recalled spray. Instead, they are advised to wear gloves and double bag the bottles in zip-top clear resealable bags, which should be placed in a small cardboard box and returned to a Walmart store for a refund. The company is also offering a $20 Walmart gift card for customers who return the product. Any surfaces or fabrics that may have been sprayed with the product would be wiped down or washed. The five-ounce glass bottles of room spray retailed for about $4 each, and were sold in in about 55 stores and online from February through October. One of six scents of aromatherapy room spray recalled by Walmart. U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Walmart has stopped selling the product, which was made in India and sold with a pump spray nozzle in the following scents and product numbers: 84140411420 Better Homes and Gardens (BHG) Gem Room Spray Lavender & Chamomile 84140411421 Better Homes and Gardens (BHG) Gem Room Spray Lemon and Mandarin 84140411422 Better Homes and Gardens (BHG) Gem Room Spray Lavender 84140411423 Better Homes and Gardens (BHG) Gem Room Spray Peppermint 84140411424 Better Homes and Gardens (BHG) Gem Room Spray Lime & Eucalyptus 84140411425 Better Homes and Gardens (BHG) Gem Room Spray Sandalwood and Vanilla Most cases of melioidosis occur in people who live in or have traveled to areas where the bacteria naturally occurs, such as parts of Asia and Australia, as well as occasionally in Brazil, Mexico and Puerto Rico. It causes a wide range of symptoms that can be confused with other common illnesses, like flu or a cold, according to the CDC. The bacteria detected in the bottles is the same type that sickened four people earlier this year, with one of the recalled sprays found October 6 in the home of a Georgia resident stricken with melioidosis in late July, according to the agency. The CDC is conducting tests to determine if the genetic fingerprint of the bacteria in the bottle matches those found in three other patients, the agency said Friday in a statement . ""Our hearts go out to the families that have been impacted by this situation,"" Dr. Inger Damon, director of CDC's division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, which manages melioidosis, said in a statement. ""Our scientists have continued to work tirelessly to try to find the potential source for the melioidosis infections in these patients. We hope this work can help protect other people who may have used this spray."" Walmart issued a separate statement late Friday. ""We are deeply concerned that there may be a connection between this product and this rare bacteria. Our sympathies and concerns are with the four families that have been impacted. We took immediate action after federal agencies alerted us Wednesday of concerns with an aromatherapy room spray manufactured by Flora Classique Inc. and sold under the Better Homes & Gardens brand. We pulled the product from the shelves of about 55 stores where it was part of a pilot program and put a register block in place at our stores and online to prevent any further sales."" The company also reiterated the importance of handling the products safely and returning to Walmart. The U.S. Department of Defense in June awarded a $3 million contract to the University of Hawaii at Manoa's School of Life Sciences to develop a vaccine for melioidosis, which experts say can be a potential bioterrorism threat.

She still uses a form of the device at nights. On June 8, 1953, Martha Lillard celebrated her fifth birthday with a party at an amusement park in Oklahoma. A little over a week later, she woke up with a sore throat and a pain in her neck. Her family took her to the hospital, where she was diagnosed with polio. She spent six months in the hospital, where she was put in a giant metal tank — a ventilator informally called an iron lung — to help her breathe. To this day, Lillard is one of the last people in the U.S. who still depends on an iron lung to survive. Polio is a potentially life-threatening disease, once among the world's most feared. In the late 1940s, polio disabled an average of 35,000 people in the U.S. every year. A polio vaccine became widely available in 1955, and millions of Americans got vaccinated. Since 1979, no cases of polio have originated in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The disease has been nearly eradicated — the World Health Organization documented only 175 cases of wild polio in 2019. It remains endemic in only Pakistan and Afghanistan. Although most people who contract polio will not have visible symptoms, a severe case can infect the brain and spinal cord and cause paralysis. Lillard's breathing muscles were weakened by the disease, and she survived thanks to the iron lung. Iron lung respirators are prepared in an emergency polio ward at a Boston hospital in August 1955.

Patients lie inside with just their heads resting outside; a seal around the patient's neck creates a vacuum. Bellows at the base of the device do the work of a human diaphragm — they create negative pressure so the user's lungs fill with air, and positive pressure allowing the person to exhale. Sixty-eight years later, an iron lung is still keeping Lillard alive — she sleeps in it every night. While many people who had polio or post-polio syndrome either weaned themselves off the machines or switched to another form of ventilator, Lillard never did. ""I've tried all the forms of ventilation, and the iron lung is the most efficient and the best and the most comfortable way,"" she told Radio Diaries . The antiquated machines are now more likely to be found in a museum than in someone's home. In the 1990s, when her iron lung was breaking down, she called hospitals and museums that might have had old ones in storage. But they'd either thrown them away or didn't want to part with their collection. She eventually bought one from a man in Utah — the machine she still uses today. The machines were once serviced by Philips Resperonic, but Lillard says the assistance she received from the company was minimal. Once, she says a technician was sent to service her machine and prepared to leave before putting the machine back together. Lillard has gotten stuck in the iron lung. She lost power when an ice storm came through Oklahoma and her emergency generator didn't kick on, leaving her trapped in the device without heat. ""It's like being buried alive almost, you know — it's so scary,"" Lillard says. She tried to call 911, but the cell towers weren't working. ""I was having trouble breathing. And I remember saying out loud to myself, 'I'm not going to die.' "" Lillard was eventually able to get a signal, but she remembers the emergency responders had no idea what an iron lung was. Luckily, they were able to get the generator going for her. Wear on parts is her main issue now. The belts need to be replaced every few weeks, the cot inside every six months, the motor every 12 years or so. Her most immediate need is collars. The collars create the critical airtight seal around the neck. Each one lasts only for a few months. And she has bought all the back stock of collars from places that don't produce them anymore. Martha Lillard says she worries about running out of replacement parts to make her iron lung respirator function properly. Courtesy of Martha Lillard hide caption ""That's the main thing I'm having a hard time with, because I try to stretch out, make these collars last longer,"" Lillard says. ""And when they start deteriorating, it gets harder and harder to breathe as they leak more."" She has only a handful of collars left. ""I really am desperate,"" she says. ""That's the most scary thing in my life right now — is not finding anybody that can make those collars."" Today, Lillard spends much of her time alone. She paints, watches old Hollywood movies and takes care of her beagles. She has been mostly isolating throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, seeing her sister, Cindy, and her brother-in-law, Daryl, in the evenings. Being affected by polio at such a young age has meant Lillard hasn't been able to have all the experiences others have had. She attended school from home for much of her childhood and couldn't participate in most extracurricular activities — she still remembers longing to go camping with her siblings. She was not able to have children or hold a steady job because of her physical limitations. Although some of her life experiences were limited, Lillard thanks a childhood friend named Karen Rapp for teaching her to appreciate small things. Together, they observed ants and built little villages of grass huts. ""There's much more to see if you really look for it,"" she says. And she's grateful for the iron lung. ""It's what sustains me. It's what heals me. It's what allows me to breathe the next day,"" Lillard says. ""I look at it as a friend, as a very dear friend.""

(TSXV: DMT) (OTCQB: DMTTF) (the “ Company ” or “ Small Pharma ”), a neuropharmaceutical company focused on psychedelic-assisted therapies, today announced that it has received European patent grant number EP 3 463 323 as acceptance for its European patent application No. 17 728640.8. The patent grants certain protections for oral dosage forms of a range of 2R,6R-hydroxynorketamine (“ 6-HNK ”) based compounds, including the Company’s preclinical candidate SPL801B, for the treatment of depressive disorders. Peter Rands, Chief Executive Officer of Small Pharma, said: “We continue to experience rapid maturation both in our corporate profile and the progression of our pipeline of therapeutic candidates. Securing the patent rights to SPL801B, our preclinical ketamine-based candidate for the treatment of depression, allows us to securely investigate its commercial potential. This is the third patent to be granted in our growing IP portfolio which protects the Company’s rights to innovate and develop novel treatment candidates for mental health conditions.” The European patent office has determined the patentability of the novel dosage forms of 6-HNK, an active ketamine metabolite. The European patent also provides protection for a solid oral dosage form of SPL801B for administration, in combination with a serotonin modulator, for use in the treatment of depressive disorders. Early preclinical studies of SPL801B have shown signs of potential antidepressant effects without the psychoactive effects typically associated with ketamine. About Small Pharma Small Pharma is a neuropharmaceutical company specialized in IP-led development of novel treatments for mental health conditions, with a focus on depression. Small Pharma initiated a clinical program into N,N-dimethyltryptamine (“ DMT ”) assisted therapy in February 2021. This program includes a Phase I/IIa trial on the Company’s lead candidate alongside development of a robust pipeline of proprietary preclinical assets. About SPL801B SPL801B is a proprietary drug substance based on 6-HNK which is an active metabolite of ketamine. Scientific evidence suggests 6-HNK offers the potential for rapid antidepressant effects and may deliver an improved side effect profile to ketamine as an antidepressant.

Ask a pediatrician: How can parents best support their children during the pandemic?,https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-10-pediatrician-parents-children-pandemic.html,['Health'],,,"Q: My children are having a rough time as the pandemic drags on. What are the signs that they may need more support, and how can I help?",,2021-10-25 19:00:07,"Q: My children are having a rough time as the pandemic drags on. What are the signs that they may need more support, and how can I help? A: The ongoing stress, fear, grief and uncertainty from COVID-19 have weighed on all of us. Many children and teens have also had a tough time coping. Over 120,000 children in the United States have lost a primary caregiver to a COVID-19-associated death. Many have lost jobs, and many are having financial trouble due to the pandemic. There have also been unequal effects of the pandemic on Black and Brown people, and increased racism and xenophobia toward Asian families. The usual supports for children, such as school, health care and community, were also interrupted, in many cases. Check in with your children often and watch and listen for signs they are struggling. Invite your children to talk about how they are feeling. Feeling depressed, hopeless, anxious and angry could be normal reactions to stress. However, if these feelings are constant and overwhelming, or if they affect your child's ability to keep doing what they usually do (such as go to school, complete their work or have fun), these may be signs they need more support. Keep in mind that younger children may not know how to talk about these feelings but may show changes in their behavior or development. Teens and young adults may try to hide their feelings because of shame or because they don't want to bother others. Signs of stress and mental health challenges are not the same for every child or teen, but there are some common symptoms. Young children may start acting like they did when they were younger. They may also have increased problems with: Older children and teens may show signs of distress with symptoms such as: Changes in mood that are not usual, such as ongoing irritability, feelings of hopelessness or rage, and frequent fights with friends and family Changes in behavior, such as stepping back from personal relationships. For example, your outgoing teen stops spending time or texting with friends or video chatting Your pediatrician can give you advice on ways to best support your child and help them build resilience, which is ""the ability to deal with and recover from stress."" Always check in with your child, ask them how they are feeling, and remind them you are there to talk if they want, and/or when they are ready. Some children or teens may need more time and space to express their feelings. Some may do better with gradual conversations and other activities besides talking, such as painting, drawing or physical activity to manage stress. Others might be more comfortable with direct conversations or activities. Parents set the tone in the household. Expressing extreme doom or fear can affect your children. It can be challenging to stay positive, especially if you're struggling with your own stress. But try to stay positive and give consistent and hopeful messages. It helps to set aside time to take care of yourself for a few minutes every day. This will help you, your child and your entire family in the long run. If you have any concerns, ask your pediatrician's office about checking on your child's social and emotional health.

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared that by 2050, the number of people living with disabling hearing loss will reach over 900 million. Apart from that, physiological aging of the ear, genetic susceptibility, higher noise exposure, vascular disorder, and chronic inflammation would also contribute to the surging demand for these aids. However, the social stigma associated with hearing loss and devices often results in patients missing their check-ups. It may hamper growth. Hearing Devices Segment to Lead Stoked by Rising Usage of Behind-the-ear Devices Based on product, the hearing devices segment is set to hold the largest hearing aids market share and lead in the coming years. This growth is attributable to the rising usage of behind-the-ear devices as they resemble Bluetooth earphones. Also, invisible-in-the-canal and completely in the canal devices are nowadays experiencing high demand because of their ability to provide more confidence in people. Increasing Development of Novel Devices to Spur Growth in Europe In 2020, North America procured USD 2.48 billion in terms of revenue. The increasing adoption of less noticeable devices to surge the aesthetic appeal would aid growth. Europe is projected to witness lucrative growth throughout the forthcoming years on account of the rising research and development activities to create advanced hearing aids. In Asia Pacific, the increasing old age population is expected to drive growth. Have Any Query?

(Theratechnologies) (TSX: TH) (NASDAQ: THTX), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies, is pleased to announce that it has reached an agreement with the Italian Medicines Agency, AIFA, for the reimbursement of Trogarzo ® for eligible people aged 18 and older living with multi-drug resistant (MDR) HIV-1. “This agreement is an important milestone for Trogarzo ® and for HIV-1 patients in Italy,” said Conor Walshe, General Manager, Europe. “Italy is the first country with a universal healthcare plan that has approved the formal reimbursement of Trogarzo ® for all patients in need. We expect to launch Trogarzo ® in Italy during the current quarter and look forward to its wider commercial availability in Europe over the coming months.” Trogarzo ® was first approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2018 and was the first long-acting agent approved for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in heavily treatment-experienced adults with MDR HIV-1 infection failing their current antiretroviral regimen. Trogarzo ® was approved by the European Medical Agency (EMA) in September 2019 for the treatment of adults infected with MDR HIV-1 for whom it is otherwise not possible to construct a suppressive antiviral regimen and is also commercially available in Germany. A number of patients are also being treated with Trogarzo ® in other European countries through early access programs. Theratechnologies plans to launch Trogarzo ® on a country-by-country basis across Europe as it gains reimbursement in each individual country. In addition, the Company received regulatory approval in Israel for Trogarzo ® and is working to secure pricing and reimbursement. About Trogarzo ® 1 Trogarzo ® a humanized monoclonal antibody of immunoglobulin G type 4 (IgG4), is a CD4 domain 2-directed HIV-1 inhibitor. Trogarzo ® blocks HIV-1 from infecting CD4+ T cells by binding to domain 2 of CD4 and interfering with the post-attachment steps required for the entry of HIV-1 virus particles into host cells and preventing the viral transmission that occurs via cell-cell fusion. Trogarzo ® is administered every 2 weeks via intravenous infusion. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were rash (9.2%), diarrhea (3.9%), dizziness (3.9%), headache (3.9%), nausea (3.9%), fatigue (2.0%) and vomiting (2.0%).

I didn’t care what they did once they got rid of the cancer.” While she never imagined breast cancer was coming down the tracks, Carly became aware of the disease when she was 16, after her school pal told her that having pains in the chest could be indicative of cancer. “I said, ‘ah Shelly, give it over, that’s for older women — we don’t get that’,” says Carly. “I thought it was no big deal, but she told me you can get it at any age.” After this conversation, Carly decided to check her own breasts at home and discovered a marble-like lump in her left breast. She decided to mention it to her family GP the next time she was there, who told her it was just fatty tissue and that young girls’ breasts change all the time due to hormones. Carly put it to the back of her mind until she began experiencing pains in her right breast in 2019, when she was aged 24 and working as a retail assistant in Penneys on O’Connell Street. “I was getting a shooting pain, which I thought was a little bit strange,” she says, “but I was constantly running around after everyone else and put myself on the back burner. Also, it’s €60 for the doctor, and I was thinking that I could get myself an outfit for going out at the weekend.” Carly was also suffering with her mental health and eventually decided that she needed a full GP check-up. Her aim was to get everything that was on her mind about her health checked out, so she went to a new GP, who decided to send her to a hospital breast clinic for reassurance. The specialist at the hospital told Carly not to be concerned as she “wasn’t at the top of his worry list”, but sent her for an ultrasound as a precaution six weeks later. She instinctively knew there was something wrong when she heard the radiographer’s sharp intake of breath and three doctors came to examine the monitor. “I thought it couldn’t be good,” Carly recalls. “They said I had to have a core needle biopsy and came in straight away to do it.” It took around five weeks for all tests to be completed, and in the meantime, Carly had a lumpectomy in August 2019 on the lump she had first felt in her left breast at 16. This turned out to be a fibroadenoma, which is a common, benign breast tumour. Home & Property Get the best home, property and gardening stories straight to your inbox every Saturday. Enter email address This field is required Sign Up The tests on the tissue in her right breast were still taking place when Carly went away on holidays with her mother Sharon. While they were abroad, the hospital phoned Sharon and said that Carly would need to come in as soon as they were home. “My mam is my best friend and has been with me through thick and thin,” Carly says. “She told me about the call as it wouldn’t have been fair to keep it from me. I said, ‘it’s okay mam, I know I have cancer’. I always call her the ‘queen of wishful thinking’ and God love her, I don’t think that it even occurred to her that I had cancer. She was trying to reassure me that it would all be okay.” When they arrived home and attended the clinic, the news was broken that Carly had secretory carcinoma — a rare cancer previously known as juvenile breast carcinoma as it can affect children. It was renamed after recognition that it can present over a wide age range. “I already knew in my heart and soul,” says Carly. Aside from the enormity of having cancer, most women would find the prospect of having a mastectomy very upsetting, but the surgeon assured Carly that she would have a full reconstruction at the same time. Both procedures went smoothly and Carly healed very well, but she was informed that the cancer had spread to her lymph nodes so she needed to undergo chemotherapy and radiotherapy. “They dropped the bomb on me that chemo can destroy the reproductive system,” adds Carly. “Kids aren’t something I’m overly pushed on even now, but they wanted to give me the option to retrieve my eggs, as things can change very rapidly, especially if you meet somebody.” The process to retrieve Carly’s eggs involved an accelerated programme of daily injections, “super-charged” hormones and scans for three weeks. She says this was gruelling and the hardest part of the whole experience, but 14 viable eggs were retrieved. Her chemotherapy began two weeks later in December 2019, but once Covid struck, she couldn’t have her mum with her during sessions, which made things more difficult. Her treatment ended in September 2020 and she was hugely relieved to be told the previous month that she was cancer-free. “It felt surreal as I was still undergoing radiotherapy,” she says. “My scans have been clear for the past year, but obviously you’re not completely clear until five years.” Expand Close Breast cancer patient ambassadors Pascaline Fresneau, Barbara King, Carly Mahady and Tracy Bennett at the launch of the Breast Cancer Isn’t Just Pink video / Facebook Twitter Email Whatsapp Breast cancer patient ambassadors Pascaline Fresneau, Barbara King, Carly Mahady and Tracy Bennett at the launch of the Breast Cancer Isn’t Just Pink video Carly is one of 3,704 people diagnosed with breast cancer each year in Ireland, and like her own story, each person affected has a different tale to tell. She has joined with The Marie Keating Foundation to mark Breast Cancer Awareness Month by partnering with Fleetwood Paints and well-known designer Róisín Lafferty. They want to showcase how ‘Breast Cancer Isn’t Just Pink’ by unveiling a series of bespoke paint colours to represent the uniqueness of a breast cancer diagnosis and journey. “People always associate purple with me,” Carly says. “It’s my favourite colour and when you look at secretory carcinoma cells under the microscope, they’re actually purple, which I found mad.” Read More When the doctor told me I had breast cancer, it felt as if he had told me I was pregnant – I was in shock The breast cancer is gone – and now I must process the trauma Carly says that any other anxieties and worries about work and social life receded as she concentrated on dealing with the cancer. This even extended to her appearance. “Any insecurities I had about how I looked disappeared,” she admits. “I said, ‘look Carly, you’re going to lose every hair on your head and you’ll be swollen, so there’s no hope you’ll be looking well. Your superficialness kind of leaves you because you have one purpose only and that’s to get better.” There are lingering side effects and Carly gets fatigued quickly and bruises extremely easily, so she feels a bit physically fragile. Obviously it has taken a mental toll, too. Now 26, the strong and determined young woman has become a huge advocate for the breast screening age of 50 being lowered. Thinking back to the young schoolgirl who didn’t have a clue about cancer, she firmly believes that awareness should be taught at school. “I know your breasts change over time, but we should have been made aware of the possibility that you can get cancer at any age,” she says. “I think women’s breasts should be checked when they’re going in for contraception and it should be part of a general check-up. It’s very important to highlight that cancer doesn’t discriminate and younger people are diagnosed with it all of the time.” The Breast Cancer Isn’t Just Pink video, breast cancer information and links to the Marie Keating Foundation’s support groups for every stage of a breast cancer journey, can be found at mariekeating.ie/notjustpink Read More Breast cancer: ‘Each drug that is discovered might mean that I get another month, or two months, or three months, with my children.’",https://www.independent.ie/life/health-wellbeing/living-with-cancer/ee36a/40975965.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/ih%20carly%202,independent

Moreover, single-arm medical pendant manufacturing companies faced issues such as production at full capacity, in-person product demonstrations, and conferences due to restriction on social gathering. Lockdown in Asia-Pacific countries such as India and China delayed the production and shipments of single-arm medical pendant products. This hampered the overall revenue of the global market.

Moderna says its low-dose COVID vaccine works for kids 6 to 11,https://abc30.com/moderna-vaccine-for-kids-who-has-near-me-costco-booster-covid/11166164/,,['AP'],,"Moderna said half-dose shots induced strong levels of virus-fighting antibodies in youngsters, with temporary side effects such as fever and fatigue.",,2021-10-25 16:31:03,"Moderna said Monday that a low dose of its COVID-19 vaccine is safe and appears to work in 6- to 11-year-olds, as the manufacturer moves toward expanding shots to children. Competitor Pfizer's kid-sized vaccine doses are closer to widespread use, undergoing evaluation by the Food and Drug Administration for nearly the same age group - starting at age 5. Its vaccine already is authorized for anyone 12 or older. Moderna hasn't yet gotten the nod to offer its vaccine to teens but is studying lower doses in younger children while it waits. Researchers tested two shots for the 6- to 11-year-olds, given a month apart, that each contained half the dose given to adults. Preliminary results showed vaccinated kids developed virus-fighting antibodies similar to levels that young adults produce after full-strength shots, Moderna said in a press release. The study included 4,753 kids ages 6 to 11, who got either the vaccine or dummy shots. Moderna said that like adults, the vaccinated youngsters had temporary side effects including fatigue, headache, fever and injection site pain. The study was too small to spot any extremely rare side effects, such as heart inflammation that sometimes occurs after either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines, mostly among young men. Moderna said it plans to submit its pediatric data to the FDA and global regulators soon. The FDA hasn't yet ruled on the company's application to expand its vaccinations to 12- to 17-year-olds, although some countries have cleared Moderna's shots for adolescents. But the U.S. is expected to begin vaccinating kids under 12 sometime next month, if the FDA clears small doses of the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine for 5- to 11-year-olds. Pfizer reported last week that its kid-sized doses proved nearly 91% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 in the younger age group, even as the extra-contagious delta variant was spreading widely. FDA's advisers will deliberate Pfizer's evidence in a public meeting Tuesday. If the agency authorizes Pfizer's kid shots, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the following week is set to recommend who should receive them.",,abc30

In June 2021, CLS announced that Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg, Medical faculty in Germany will be evaluating the use of TRANBERG Thermal Therapy system with MRI-US, fusion-guided focal laser ablation therapy in early stage prostate cancer in a 10-patient clinical trial. See published clinical studies . “CLS’s TRANBERG Thermal Therapy System has successfully performed MRI-guided, focal laser ablation treatments for hundreds of patients suffering from early stage prostate cancer,” stated Dan Mogren, acting CEO for CLS. “Recent development improvements of MRI-Ultrasound, fusion-guidance systems have enabled both diagnostic biopsy and other ablation procedures, such as cryoablation, to be effectively performed within a doctor’s office setting. We believe our laser ablation system will function very well and produce excellent results as a focal therapy using the same fused image guidance technology.” The safety and diagnostic accuracy of MRI-US, fusion-guided prostate biopsies is well documented with strong global market growth each year. The workflow for focal laser ablation of prostate tumors is very similar to the one used for biopsy and can potentially be performed also as a follow-on outpatient procedure. High precision, image-guided focal laser ablation performed using the TRANBERG Thermal Therapy System is safe and offers a focal therapy option for treatment of prostate tumors while minimizing side effects and maintaining the patient’s quality of life. High Precision Thermal Therapy System The TRANBERG® |Thermal Therapy System has been developed for image-guided, high-precision soft tissue thermal therapy and ablation procedures. For the US market, the system is configured for CT or MRI-US, fusion image-guided procedures, and can be configured for tissue temperature feedback for precise temperature and ablation control. It includes a desk-top mobile laser unit, innovative non-cooled laser applicators, external tissue temperature probe sensors, and procedure specific accessories. Its non-cooled, laser fiber technology optimizes heat distribution, eliminates the need for external cooling, and helps reduce procedure times. About Clinical Laserthermia Systems Clinical Laserthermia Systems AB (publ) develops and sells the TRANBERG® Thermal Therapy System , including sterile disposables, for minimally invasive treatment of cancer tumors and drug-resistant epilepsy, according to regulatory approvals in the EU and the US.

Moderna says its low-dose COVID vaccine works for kids 6 to 11,https://6abc.com/moderna-vaccine-for-kids-who-has-near-me-costco-booster-covid/11166164/,,['AP'],,"Moderna said half-dose shots induced strong levels of virus-fighting antibodies in youngsters, with temporary side effects such as fever and fatigue.",,2021-10-25 16:10:58,"Moderna said Monday that a low dose of its COVID-19 vaccine is safe and appears to work in 6- to 11-year-olds, as the manufacturer moves toward expanding shots to children. Competitor Pfizer's kid-sized vaccine doses are closer to widespread use, undergoing evaluation by the Food and Drug Administration for nearly the same age group - starting at age 5. Its vaccine already is authorized for anyone 12 or older. Moderna hasn't yet gotten the nod to offer its vaccine to teens but is studying lower doses in younger children while it waits. Researchers tested two shots for the 6- to 11-year-olds, given a month apart, that each contained half the dose given to adults. Preliminary results showed vaccinated kids developed virus-fighting antibodies similar to levels that young adults produce after full-strength shots, Moderna said in a press release. EMBED > More News Videos Vaccines for children will ""very likely"" be available in early November, Dr. Anthony Fauci told ""This Week"" anchor George Stephanopoulos. The study included 4,753 kids ages 6 to 11, who got either the vaccine or dummy shots. Moderna said that like adults, the vaccinated youngsters had temporary side effects including fatigue, headache, fever and injection site pain. The study was too small to spot any extremely rare side effects, such as heart inflammation that sometimes occurs after either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines, mostly among young men. Moderna said it plans to submit its pediatric data to the FDA and global regulators soon. The FDA hasn't yet ruled on the company's application to expand its vaccinations to 12- to 17-year-olds, although some countries have cleared Moderna's shots for adolescents. But the U.S. is expected to begin vaccinating kids under 12 sometime next month, if the FDA clears small doses of the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine for 5- to 11-year-olds. Pfizer reported last week that its kid-sized doses proved nearly 91% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 in the younger age group, even as the extra-contagious delta variant was spreading widely. FDA's advisers will deliberate Pfizer's evidence in a public meeting Tuesday. If the agency authorizes Pfizer's kid shots, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the following week is set to recommend who should receive them. Report a correction or typo",,6abc

"'Get the test done,' says breast cancer survivor",https://www.inforum.com/newsmd/wellness/7249291-Get-the-test-done-says-breast-cancer-survivor,,,,Leann Jeffers shares her story during October Breast Cancer Awareness Month.,,2021-10-25 12:00:00,"WORTHINGTON, Minn. — Leann Jeffers tells people she feels like she had cancer for all of five minutes, but the effects of being diagnosed with breast cancer and going through a double mastectomy will be with her for the rest of her life. The rural Worthington woman went in for her first mammogram earlier this year, expecting it to be a routine procedure. After all, she felt fine and had no other health issues. Those reasons were why, at age 42, Jeffers had delayed having the cancer-screening procedure done two years ago, at the age when all women are encouraged to have their first mammogram. “When I turned 40, I had the mentality that I didn’t need to go in and get a mammogram,” Jeffers shared. “So, I put it off.” When her 41st birthday rolled around, Jeffers was transitioning from her job at Bedford Tech to her new job at Schaap Sanitation. Again, she decided to delay making the appointment. Then, with her 42nd birthday approaching, Jeffers said she heard a coworker talking about scheduling her mammogram because she was about to turn 40. It was time, she figured, and scheduled her mammogram at Sanford Worthington through its online appointment system. The mammogram went smoothly and Jeffers said she assumed the results would come back fine. That, however, wasn’t the case. She was first notified of something suspicious through a communication from My Sanford Chart, and was scheduled for a May 4 ultrasound at Sanford to gather additional images. “They brought in the head radiologist,” Jeffers recalled. “He said there was something on there that didn’t look right.” The concern prompted Jeffers to call the Edith Sanford Breast Center in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, in hopes they would look at the images. Since she no longer had a primary physician — her former physician had left Sanford Worthington — Jeffers said she took the reins. Within a week of her ultrasound in Worthington, Jeffers was seen at the Edith Sanford facility for a core biopsy. It was performed the day before her daughter, Ariana’s, senior prom. “Two days later, I got a call from a nurse navigator,” Jeffers shared. Having been told by a friend that if a nurse navigator called it was because she had cancer, Jeffers said she panicked when she saw the call come in from the 605 area code. “It felt like a kick to the stomach,” she said. After the call, Jeffers drove to the construction site of the new Worthington downtown pavilion, where her husband Chad was working, to share the news with him. “He said he knew it was something as soon as he saw me drive up,” she said. It was the start of a whirlwind experience — one that no one ever wants to go through — for Jeffers. The images and data collected from her mammogram, ultrasound and core biopsy were compiled and shared with a team of Sanford physicians — the best at Sanford, Jeffers said. It was during that discussion that one doctor found something suspicious in another area of Jeffers’ right breast. “I went back in for a second biopsy two days before my daughter’s (high school) graduation,” Jeffers said. The results confirmed the presence of a second tumor. Her ultimate diagnosis was invasive ductal carcinoma — invasive meaning the two tumors were in the milk duct but hadn’t broken the wall of the milk duct. Jeffers underwent a double mastectomy on June 14, during which a third, smaller tumor was discovered in the milk duct, but hadn’t yet reached the wall. That one was considered noninvasive. “When I had the surgery, they also removed six of my lymph nodes,” Jeffers said. “All of them were clear margins and there was no cancer detected in them.” As part of the double mastectomy, Jeffers had immediate reconstruction with silicone breast implants and spent one night in the hospital. “Because I did the double mastectomy, I didn’t need any radiation,” she said, adding that chemotherapy was also not needed. Jeffers was prescribed a hormone blocker, however, that she will take for the next five years. “My cancer grew because of my estrogen — I had too high estrogen levels,” she said. “By taking the pill, it is starving any cancer that might be there.” Jeffers said there is a family history with breast cancer on both her mother’s and father’s sides of the family. Yet, when she inquired about early testing with a former physician, it didn’t seem to be a concern. “Get the test done,” she encouraged. “It’s not as scary as it sounds. Everyone jokes about how they smoosh them in like little pancakes, but it doesn’t hurt. Go and get it done for all of us Pink Warriors.” Jeffers said she asked her oncologist how long the cancer may have been present in her breast and was told it was likely there before she turned 40, however it may not have shown up on a mammogram until now. That’s why women are encouraged to get their first mammogram at age 40. It serves as a basis for future exams and helps detect any new abnormalities. Jeffers said she will now have to complete an MRI every six years, and said that with the medication she takes for estrogen, there is a “very slight chance” she could get cervical cancer. She will also have six-month visits with her oncologist for the next two years, followed by annual visits thereafter. “I’m one of the more fortunate ones,” she said, realizing how lucky she was that the cancer was caught early. “But it still changes your world,” she added. “It changes your perspective on life. The little things seem trivial now.” Jeffers and her husband have two children — Ariana, 19, and Jackson, 13. The couple also lost a son 14 years ago to a rare disease when he was just six weeks old. “We’ve had a lot of hardship in our family,” Jeffers said, noting that she lost her mom when her daughter was six months old. “But, I don’t let those hardships define who I am. They just shape who I am. “My mom was legally blind and raised me from birth with no eyesight,” she said. “If she can raise a child with no eyesight, walking by faith and not by sight, I can kick cancer’s butt.”",https://www.dglobe.com/incoming/7244215-qg6twu-102021-N-DG-LEANNJEFFERSI-S4.jpg/alternates/BASE_LANDSCAPE/102021%20N%20DG%20LEANNJEFFERSI%20S4.jpg,inforum

The report offers a detailed analysis of changing market trends, top segments, key investment pockets, value chain, regional landscape, and competitive scenario. For Right Perspective and Competitive Insights, Get Sample Report at: https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-sample/387 Surge in prevalence of equine diseases and increase in animal health expenditure drive the growth of the global equine healthcare market. However, decline in the global equine population hinders the market growth. On the other hand, increase in demand for pet insurance presents new opportunities in the coming years. Covid-19 Scenario: Government regulations in many countries mandated the closedown of equine facilities to lower down the spread of the virus and reduce the risks of injury. However, many equine facilities opened post-lockdown. The complete or partial closure of equine facilities led to losses in overall revenue and made it difficult for equine healthcare players to cover ongoing expenses. Rise in unemployment rates during the initial phase of the pandemic led to increased issues associated with equine welfare. The report offers detailed segmentation of the global equine healthcare market based on product type, disease, distribution channel, and region. Based on product type, the drugs segment contributed to the highest share in 2020, holding nearly two-thirds of the total share, and is projected to maintain its lead position during the forecast period. However, the vaccines segment is expected to register the largest CAGR of 7.8% from 2021 to 2030. Do You Have Any Query Or Specific Requirement?

In a series of radio interviews, Legault said staff shortages could necessitate putting off the deadline again after an initial Oct. 15 date was pushed back by a month for the same reason. The province had said workers not fully vaccinated by the October date would face suspension without pay, but Health Minister Christian Dubé backed down a few days before the deadline. He said the health system was facing the loss of about unvaccinated 22,000 workers, which would have put too much strain on an already taxed system.

Story continues below advertisement Legault told Montreal’s 98.5 FM that compulsory vaccination could be imposed in certain fields rather than across the entire network. “We will surely be able to apply it in certain places,” Legault said. “In emergency rooms, of course, it must be applied because there is very close contact with patients. There are regions where we will be able to apply it.” Legault noted that only three per cent of nurses are unvaccinated but added that they are all needed, because the system is already short 4,000 nurses.

The province is offering bonuses of up to $18,000 to bring as many as 4,000 nurses back to the network in the coming months. In numbers released last week, Dubé said 1,756 people had accepted the offer, including 58 nurses coming out of retirement. Of the rest, 351 were shifting from private agencies and 1,347 were part-time workers who switched to full time.

Drinking tea and eating cake are only part of what’s on offer. The main attraction is what’s up for discussion: the menopause.,,2021-10-25 01:30:00,"They are cafes but with something different on the menu. Drinking tea and eating cake are only part of what’s on offer. The main attraction is what’s up for discussion: the menopause. F ormer public health nurse Breeda Bermingham, who lives in Co Waterford, first introduced the concept of cafes to discuss the menopause in 2019, but the pandemic put her plans to have a cafe in every county in the country on ice. After hosting a few in-person cafes in her native Waterford, she moved online as restrictions shut everything down. But with the world reopening, Breeda hopes that face-to-face meetings will now be back on the agenda and women can come together in person again to discuss their experiences of menopause and gain valuable information and insights from one another. A mother of four children ranging in age from 17 to 27, she introduced the Midlife Women Rock cafes two years ago to help women become empowered to manage their menopause journey positively and proactively. Breeda says: “The massive lack of information and misunderstanding around menopause has catapulted me into this space as I see an injustice here that needs to be uncovered. I have discovered from my own research that it is the silence around menopause that is the real enemy. Many women are negotiating this silence by attending talks alone, returning repeatedly to their GP, going online or gathering information from magazines.” She believes women have been shamed into staying silent and the stereotypes of menopausal women feed into this silence. Her idea was to bring women together over tea and coffee after she’d read about the menopause cafe concept developed by Rachel Weiss in Scotland. Weiss set up the very first menopause cafe in June 2017 in Perth, and since then the movement has travelled the world with cafes springing up in locations from Mexico City to Bahrain. The simple guidelines for the event are: respecting one another’s confidentiality, not pushing any particular product or service, and encouraging participants to move tables regularly to speak to as many people as possible. Breeda’s interest in the menopause was sparked when she returned to education to study psychology. In her final year of study, at the age of 51, she found herself delving into literature on women during midlife, but found it severely lacking. Now 55, she says she knew nothing about perimenopause or menopause before she started her research. “Menopause and shame has been synonymous for decades. The silencing of women as they move through menopause has been handed down to us for generations,” says Breeda.

Expand Close Liz Wenden-Kerr and Anne McGale, who run them in the North / Facebook Twitter Email Whatsapp Liz Wenden-Kerr and Anne McGale, who run them in the North She recalls the very first cafe event in 2019 when women showed up to learn from one another. She says: “I could see the fear in their eyes. They varied from some having lots of questions to others just wanting to listen. By the end of the two hours, they didn’t want to leave. They’d never spoken to anyone about any of this. “What they saw was that the woman sitting beside them was feeling the exact same thing. It may have been low mood, anxiety or feeling there’s something wrong with them. “I see the menopause story as this large puzzle. There are so many pieces and it’s a story that’s still evolving. There’s also the impact on relationships and family — it’s not just the woman alone who’s impacted by the story that’s been told to us.” Breeda points out that if women want to see change, they need to take responsibility for opening up this story. She adds: “If we want to change the rhetoric we have to start speaking up openly. It’s all about the shame, we’re ashamed to be there. We think there’s something wrong but that’s not the truth.” During lockdown, Breeda focused on writing her book on midlife women and Midlife Women Rock and she is now hoping to bring cafes to every county in Ireland. She’s also working with Social Entrepreneurs Ireland, who helped her set up the first cafe in Waterford, bringing her ambition to life. In the North, after hosting the first menopause cafe in Belfast, one woman stood out in organiser Liz Wenden-Kerr’s mind. Relief flooded her face as other women shared their experiences of menopause. She left feeling like a burden had been lifted — that what she was feeling was normal. The reaction is typical of women’s experiences when they sit down and discuss the often taboo subject of menopause and this is where the idea of the menopause cafe concept came from: to allow women to talk and realise they’re not alone. A nurse by profession, Wenden-Kerr set up the first menopause cafe north of the border with her friend and fellow nurse Anne McGale, after both had worked with women experiencing difficult symptoms associated with the menopause. Read More Five menopause symptoms that you may not be aware of ‘We are socialised to think menopause is the beginning of the end’ – Dr Fiona Barry According to Anne McGale, her own experience of menopause was very difficult. She lost over two stone, found herself crying all the time and lost confidence. “I continued at my work but between patients I was in floods of tears. I’d tidy myself up and go and see my next patient. I couldn’t get on top of it. I kept saying, ‘this is not the person I am’,” she says of her symptoms. After being prescribed HRT, she started to feel a bit better. She was then prescribed a higher dose of the hormone oestrogen and says it took three to six months before she started to feel like her old self again. For her colleague Liz, the experience of menopause was also difficult. And while her menstrual cycle was normal, it was when she was in her 30s that she was diagnosed with premature ovarian insufficiency, also known as premature menopause. It blindsided her and took her a long time to get to the point where she could accept the fact she couldn’t have children of her own. When they met at work helping to treat women who were going through something similar, the pair decided to act. Their first menopause Cafe ran in September and it’s the first of many they hope to run. It attracted 33 women — numbers were restricted and participants had to book online to the free event at First Avenue Cafe on the city’s Ormeau Road. Anne says: “Women went from table to table. They were laughing and exchanging stories. People spoke about their relationships and how menopause was affecting their relationships. “Being in a cafe with people you don’t know well, it’s easier to be honest; people were able to share things.” For more information see midlifewomenrockproject.com and menopausecafe.net Read More World menopause day: From feeling ‘creakier’ to ‘sailing through it’ – some well-known Irish women speak out about menopause",https://www.independent.ie/life/health-wellbeing/health-features/d31ae/40975971.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/da%20Bermingham%20Photo,independent

But he's ready to walk away from his job because of an impending mandate from President Joe Biden that federal contractors and all U.S. businesses with 100 or more workers be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. ""People are fighting for their constitutional rights - the way they think their life should be,"" said Chevalier, one of hundreds of employees at Bath Iron Works threatening to leave. Chevalier is among a small but significant number of American workers deciding whether to quit their jobs and careers in defiance of what they consider intrusive edicts that affect their freedoms. The video in the media player above was used in a previous report. The Biden administration, public health officials and many business leaders agree that vaccine requirements are legal , prudent actions necessary to help the world emerge from a pandemic that has killed more than 700,000 Americans and nearly 5 million people worldwide. MORE: Why lawsuits against COVID-19 vaccine mandates will likely fail The defiant workers make up a small fraction of the overall workforce, with many cities, states and businesses reporting that more than 9 out of 10 of their workers are complying with mandates. But they have the potential to create disruptions in a tight labor market and have become the latest roadblock in overcoming the vaccine hesitancy that allowed the COVID-19 crisis to take a devastating turn over the summer. In many cases, the reasons for the objections are rooted in misinformation. The refusers come from all types of occupations - defense industry workers, police officers, firefighters, educators and health care workers. In Seattle, a group of city firefighters turned in their boots at City Hall on Tuesday to protest a vaccination requirement. Thousands of people have sought religious or medical exemptions that were rejected; others won't stand to be told what to do and have quit or been fired. EXPLAINER: What to know about religious exemptions for COVID shots as vaccine mandates roll out EMBED > More News Videos Religious objections are becoming a much more widely used loophole against the COVID-19 vaccine. Nick Rolovich , the football coach at Washington State University, was let go from his $3.2 million-a-year job on Monday, along with four assistants. Rolovich, the first major college coach to lose his job over vaccination status, claimed a religious exemption but has declined to elaborate. He is suing. The conflict over mandates is likely to grow in the coming weeks. The Biden administration is expected to move forward any day with the mandate that employers with 100 or more workers require all employees be vaccinated or undergo weekly testing, though enforcement likely won't start for several weeks. The rule for federal contractors goes into effect in December, with no testing option, but many businesses, governments and schools are already implementing mandates. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other groups that represent large employers have warned workers might simply migrate to jobs at smaller businesses where they don't face vaccination requirements. That could create challenges for large retailers going into the holiday season, among other disruptions, the chamber warned. MORE: Biden, a convert to COVID vaccine mandates, champions compliance EMBED > More News Videos President Joe Biden visited the Chicago area Thursday to speak about COVID vaccinations and his Build Back Better agenda. Individuals who've left their jobs and are seeking work that doesn't require vaccinations are sharing information on social media. Small employers looking for workers are turning to online job boards such as RedBalloon, where employers sign a pledge that they won't make vaccines a condition for hiring. Andrew Crapuchettes, RedBalloon's founder and chief executive, said he started the online job board more than two months ago for people ""who just want to work and don't want to get into politics in the office."" More than 800 companies have posted, and more than 250,000 people have visited the site, he said. Some states, including Texas , Montana and Florida, are gearing up to fight or undercut the Biden mandates. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued an executive order Monday barring any entity from requiring vaccines. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Thursday he will call a special session to pass legislation to combat vaccine mandates, saying that, ""in Florida, your right to earn a living is not contingent upon whatever choices you're making in terms of these injections."" Melissa Alfieri-Collins, a 44-year-old mother of two, said she resigned from her job as a nurse at Jersey Shore Medical Center in Neptune, New Jersey, rather than undergo regular COVID-19 testing. She said the hospital recognized her request for a medical exemption, but she objected to the requirement that only unvaccinated people get tested, arguing that even vaccinated people can spread disease. ""My family and I, we had a long talk, and I basically don't want to compromise my values any more,"" said Alfieri-Collins, who hopes to become a nurse practitioner and pursue her own holistic practice. ""I am very sad because I am the type of nurse that loves my patients and my patients love me,"" she said. Anthony Polenski, director of strategic partnerships for tech recruiting company Jobfuture.ai, said he's seeing candidates who want to know, ""Will this company force me to take a jab?"" Polenski said they are often leaving previous employers because of a vaccine mandate. ""They don't want their vaccination status attached to their employment,"" he said. At the shipyard in Maine, frustration is rising among union members. On Friday, some 100 shipbuilders gathered outside the shipyard during their lunch break to protest being forced to get vaccinated. They marched down the street, holding signs decrying the mandate and using choice four-letter words that made clear what they think of the president and his vaccine mandates. The union fears it could lose more than 1,000 workers, or 30% of its membership, over the federal contractor mandate. Dean Grazioso, a 33-year Bath Iron Works employee, said he's not anti-vaccine but that he knows vaccinated coworkers, friends and family members who've contracted breakthrough COVID-19 infections. Such infections are rare and vaccinated people who get COVID-19 usually have mild symptoms and are far less likely to be hospitalized or die. The 53-year-old is still deciding whether to get the shot. ""I'm still up in the air,"" he said. ""But I've got a huge decision to make."" ____ Catalini reported from Trenton, New Jersey, and Dazio reported from Los Angeles.

Moderna says its low-dose COVID vaccine works for kids 6 to 11,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/childrens-covid-19-vaccine-moderna-1.6223959?cmp=rss,,['The Associated Press'],,Moderna says its clinical trials showed two doses that were half the size of its adult shots produced similar levels of virus-fighting antibodies in children.,,2021-10-25 16:44:33,"Moderna said Monday that a low dose of its COVID-19 vaccine is safe and generates an immune response in six- to 11-year-olds, as the manufacturer joins its rival Pfizer in moving toward expanding shots to children. Pfizer-BioNTech's kid-size vaccine doses are closer to widespread use. They are undergoing evaluation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for youngsters in nearly the same age group, five to 11, and could be available in the U.S. by early November. It is also awaiting approval from Health Canada for use to vaccinate Canadian kids. Pfizer's vaccine is already authorized for anyone 12 or older in both the U.S. and in Canada. CBC Explains There's a children's COVID-19 vaccine awaiting approval in Canada. What do we know about it? FDA says kid-sized Pfizer vaccine doses appear highly effective, safe Both Pfizer and Moderna have been studying lower doses for younger children. Researchers tested two Moderna shots for the six- to 11-year-olds, given a month apart, that each contained half the dose given to adults. Preliminary results showed vaccinated children developed virus-fighting antibodies similar to levels that young adults produce after full-strength shots, Moderna said in a news release on Monday. The study involved 4,753 children aged six to 11 who got either the vaccine or dummy shots. Moderna said that like adults, the vaccinated youngsters had temporary side effects including fatigue, headache, fever and injection site pain. The study was too small to spot any extremely rare side effects, such as heart inflammation that has occurred in a small number of cases after either the Moderna or Pfizer shots — which are both mRNA vaccines — mostly among young men. Moderna released no further details and hasn't submitted its data to a scientific journal but said it plans to share the interim results with the FDA and global regulators soon. The study is still going on, and the company cannot calculate the vaccine's effectiveness in actually preventing infections in children unless there are sufficient COVID-19 cases to compare rates between vaccinated and unvaccinated participants. Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine approved for 12- to 17-year-olds in Canada Canadians who had allergic reaction to first vaccine dose can safely get second, advisory committee says The FDA hasn't yet ruled on the company's application to expand its vaccinations to 12- to 17-year-olds in the U.S., although some countries, including Canada , have cleared Moderna's shots for adolescents. But the U.S. is expected to begin vaccinating children under 12 sometime next month, if the FDA clears low doses of the Pfizer vaccine for five- to 11-year-olds. Pfizer reported last week that its kid-size doses proved nearly 91 per cent effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 in that age group, even as the extra-contagious delta variant was spreading widely. FDA's advisers will weigh Pfizer's evidence in a public meeting Tuesday. If the agency authorizes Pfizer's kid shots, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is set the following week to recommend who should receive them.",,cbc

The post This Not-So-Fierce Vegetarian Might Just Be Australia’s Oldest Dinosaur appeared first on Gizmodo Australia.","Ipswich, about 40 kilometres west of Brisbane, seems an unlikely place to find dinosaur fossils. Yet the area has produced the oldest evidence of dinosaurs in Australia. A fresh look at these fossils now reveals they aren’t what they first seemed, and it’s prompting us to reconsider how the story of Australia’s dinosaurs began. In research published in Historical Biology, we reanalyse a sequence of 220-million-year-old tracks from the Ipswich Coal Measures, thought to have belonged to a carnivorous dinosaur. We show they actually belonged to an early sauropodomorph — a distant relative of the plant-eating sauropods that roamed the planet much later, during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. This is the first time fossil evidence of early sauropodomorphs has been found in Australia. Subterranean dinosaur tracks The Ipswich area was once the principal source of coal for Queensland. Its suburbs including Ebbw Vale, New Chum and Swanbank were dotted with underground mines during the late 1800s and the first half of the twentieth century. These mining operations involved the creation of deep shafts and tunnels, from which miners could access deposits of coal sandwiched between other layers of rock. Some tunnels would descend hundreds of metres below the surface. The coal would be removed from the seam by hand, and pillars were left in its place to support the ceiling of the resulting underground “room”. It was difficult and dangerous work. In 1964, miners working at the Rhondda colliery in New Chum made a startling discovery. As they removed the coal from a seam they were following 213 metres below the surface, a series of giant, three-toed tracks became exposed in the ceiling of the mine shaft. For the miners, it was as if a dinosaur had just walked over their heads. These tracks remain the oldest-known dinosaur fossils in the entire continent. They’d been made by a dinosaur walking across a layer of swampy vegetation, which would be extracted as coal 220 million years later. Buried under fine silt and mud, they’d been preserved as natural casts. It had been assumed some type of predatory dinosaur made the tracks. The only problem was the footprints were reportedly about 40–46 centimetres long. This would suggest the track-maker was just under 2m high at the hips. This isn’t necessarily large for a theropod such as Allosaurus fragillis, which was about this size. Tyrannosaurus rex was even bigger, with a hip height of about 3.2m. But the tracks found in Ipswich were created during the Late Triassic about 220 million years ago — 65 million years before Allosaurus and 150 million years before T. rex. And fossil evidence from around the world indicates theropods of a larger size didn’t appear until the start of the Early Jurrasic Period, 200 million years ago. Was something unusual afoot in Australia during the Late Triassic? As part of a broader review of Australian dinosaur tracks, we decided to take a closer look at the Rhondda colliery tracks. The mine has long been closed, so the original tracks are no longer accessible, but archival photographs and a plaster cast are held at the Queensland Museum. Dispelling the myth of the ‘Triassic terror’ Using the photos and cast, we created a 3D digital model of the track to allow a more detailed comparison with other dinosaur tracks from around the world. Our study revealed two important things. First, the footprints were not as big as initially reported. Excluding drag marks and other unrelated surface features, they are close to 32–34cm long (not 40–46cm as previously documented). Second, the shape of the footprints and the sequence in which they were made is more consistent with early sauropodomorphs. Sauropodomorphs were the distant relatives of the lumbering sauropods of the Late Jurassic and subsequent Cretaceous Period. The towering Triassic terror of the Ipswich Coal Measures was no more. In its place was a peaceful plant-eater. The remains of early sauropodomorph dinosaurs have been found in Upper Triassic rocks, aged between 220 million and 200 million years, in continental Europe, Argentina, Brazil and South Africa. And by the start of the Jurassic, 200 million years ago, they had achieved a near global distribution, with fossils in North America, China and Antarctica. This isn’t surprising, given the continents at the time were still connected in a single landmass called Pangaea. Our new interpretation of the Rhondda colliery tracks shows early sauropodomorphs lived in Australia, too, and that Australia’s first dinosaurs were friendlier than we thought. Steven W.

For medical antimicrobial products, the parameter of 'speed to kill' is critical to provide true protection: 'killing speed' of 30 minutes to hours does not protect sufficiently the wearer, it means that viruses remain infectious for that entire period of time. Only an antimicrobial 'speed to kill' of maximum 5 min provides a REAL & TRUE protection,” said Pierre Jean Messier, Executive Chairman of i3 BioMedical Inc. TrioMed Active products have been systematically in use and tested against numerous pathogenic bacteria and viruses over the course of 10+ years with the consistent results of killing (deactivating) more than 99.9% in 5 min of all the tested microbes.

Drs. Cynthia Hawkins and Roman Melnyk will receive the funds for their ground-breaking attempt to target high-grade gliomas (HGG). HGGs are aggressive and incurable brain cancers, such as glioblastoma, with an almost 100% fatality rate and no effective treatment. The funds were made available thanks to the generous support from sponsors, including Scotia Wealth Management, Yamana Gold, and Hampton Securities. Drs. Hawkins and Melnyk are developing a potential therapeutic approach that targets the RAS pathway. RAS can become dysregulated, causing cell growth and cell survival of HGGs. Their research aims to create a protein chimera called RRSP-DT that can address all the diverse ways RAS becomes dysregulated, bringing it back to a normal state. The therapy, if successful, could benefit patients diagnosed with pediatric or adult HGGs. ""This funding will allow us to follow up on our exciting early studies suggesting the protein chimera developed in Dr. Melnyk’s lab may be a promising new therapeutic approach to treat high grade gliomas,"" said Dr. Hawkins, neuropathologist and Senior Scientist, Cell Biology at The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) in Toronto. High-grade gliomas are a group that includes various brain cancers, which are particularly aggressive. The estimated two-year survival rate is 20%, despite the current standard of care that includes surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. In addition, these diseases deteriorate the quality of life for patients as they progress. However, research into treatments and technologies to combat these types of cancers is tragically underfunded. Less than 3% of all governmental cancer funding is devoted to brain cancer research. ""We remain strongly committed to supporting the fight against high-grade gliomas by funding research, treatment and technology,"" said Brain Cancer Canada chair Angela Scalisi. ""Our volunteer-based organization has already been able to give full funds to two Canadian research projects this year. We are so proud to support these brilliant scientists who endeavour each day to fight what is without a doubt one of the most lethal diseases we face"" . ""We know the best therapy we have to fight HGGs is still ineffective for the far majority of the patient population,"" said Marc Peeters, Director Partnerships and Stakeholders at Brain Cancer Canada. ""This research opens up new avenues to find better therapies, which both child and adult patients need. We are incredibly grateful to our donors, and we urge our governments to join us in funding research that is in an early stage but promising enough to warrant investment. We need to make bigger bets to achieve life-changing results for those patients who need it so much. It has been 15 years since the last therapy breakthrough, and patients cannot afford another decade-and-a-half of waiting"" .

How to Support a Person With Dementia as Lockdowns Ease,https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2021/10/dementia-lockdown-support/,"['Health', 'Life', 'au', 'brain health', 'lockdown']","['Lee-Fay Low', ' University of Sydney']",,"If your loved one has dementia, you might be wondering if their symptoms have worsened in lockdown, or if they remember who you are. The post How to Support a Person With Dementia as Lockdowns Ease appeared first on Lifehacker Australia.","Lockdowns lasting months in some states have seen tight restrictions on visitors to nursing homes. So as lockdowns ease, and if you’re vaccinated, you might be planning a happy reunion with your friend or family. If your loved one has dementia, you might be wondering if their symptoms have worsened in lockdown, or if they remember who you are. Here’s what to look out for on your first visit after lockdowns end, and how to support your loved one after that. Expect some decline Lockdowns can result in a decline in people with dementia, particularly those living in nursing homes. Research from lockdowns in 2020 showed people with dementia had more trouble thinking and problem-solving. Their behaviour and mood worsened. Some studies showed people were less able to do things around the home or look after themselves. Keeping mentally, physically and socially active helps people with dementia maintain their brain and thinking. But in lockdown, when people with dementia did less, they exercised their brains and bodies less. Lockdowns not only meant a ban on visitors to nursing homes, but limited stimulation from group activities, such as concerts, visits from schools and bus outings. During lockdowns, nursing home residents (more than half have dementia) also got worse in terms of their thinking and well-being. Residents sometimes didn’t understand why they couldn’t move freely around the nursing home, and why their loved ones had stopped visiting. This led to increases in behaviours, such as agitation. After lockdowns began, there has been an increase in prescriptions of psychotropic medications reported internationally. These medications are used in nursing homes to manage behaviours such as aggression and agitation. The first visit can be difficult Some families might be worried about their first visit in several months to a person living with dementia. They might be concerned their loved one has gotten worse, or scared they won’t recognise them. But it may help to think of visits as providing really important mental stimulation and human connection for your loved one, even though visits might be difficult emotionally for you. Introduce yourself: “Hi Dad, it’s Ali”, if it looks like your loved one can’t quite place who you are or your name. Read their reactions to you. If they need time to warm up to you (which might be disappointing if you are close), chat with someone else who is there. The person might enjoy your company even if they aren’t actively participating in the conversation at first. Then invite them to participate in the conversation by asking them their opinion: “How is the dog going?” or “I’m looking forward to going to the hairdresser, how about you?”. Prepare an activity to do together based on their interests. You could walk in the garden, browse a magazine about the royal family, sing along to a favourite album. If it’s a noisy gathering, find a quiet spot for one-on-one conversation, as the person may have trouble focusing when there are several people talking at once. READ MORE The Best Ways To Reduce the Risk of Dementia While You're Young Let them know when you’ll be back Because of your long separation, your loved one might be quite emotional or clingy when you are leaving. Let them know when you’ll be coming again. You can write this down in their calendar, or on a card to give them. You can also tell the nursing home staff so they can remind them. You can also leave a visual reminder of your visit. This could be a card or photograph, or some flowers with a note. If possible, get back into a visiting routine. If you notice a decline Families are more likely to notice small or marked changes in their loved one’s abilities if they have not seen them for several months. That might mean noticing early signs of dementia or worsening symptoms if they’ve already been diagnosed with it. So this can be a delicate conversation to have with your loved one. Many people can be defensive or in denial about changes, put it down to “old age”, and are afraid about having dementia. You might need to have the conversation several times to get them to see the doctor. Call the National Dementia Helpline on 1800 100 500 for advice. In the longer term, consider rehab Rehabilitation helps people with dementia. So it’s worth looking into what support services your loved one might need. A psychologist can help with strategies to manage memory and thinking; an occupational therapist can help with doing day-to-day things around the house; an exercise physiologist or physiotherapist can help with mobility; and a speech pathologist can help with communication. Family carers can talk to their loved one’s dementia specialist, or ask their GP for a Chronic Disease Management Plan for some subsidised rehabilitation sessions. If you’re not the main carer If you’re not the main family carer, make sure that person has some support. Ask how they are feeling and what support you can offer. Carers have been providing more help during lockdowns to people with dementia living in the community. That’s because there have been fewer services on offer, and as people with dementia needed help to comply with restrictions. Offer to spend some time with the person with dementia so the carer can have a break. Or take the carer out for a meal and some social time now restrictions have eased.

Study finds 'robust' evidence that Covid-19 is seasonal infection,https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/health/study-finds-robust-evidence-that-covid-19-is-seasonal-infection-329928,,,,"London, October 26 Covid-19 may be a seasonal infection linked to low temperatures and humidity, much like seasonal influenza, according to new ""robust"" evidence found by researchers. The study, recently published in the journal Nature Computational Science, also supports the considerable contribution of airborne SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the need to shift to measures that promote ""air hygiene."" A research team led by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal), Spain, noted that a key question regarding SARS-CoV-2 is whether it is behaving, or will behave, as a seasonal virus like influenza, or whether it will be equally transmitted during any time of the year. A first theoretical modelling study suggested that climate was not a driver in Covid-19 transmission, given the high number of susceptible individuals with no immunity to the virus. However, some observations suggested that the initial propagation of Covid-19 in China occurred in a latitude between 30 and 50 degrees N, with low humidity levels and low temperatures between 5 degrees and 11 degrees Celsius. ""The question of whether Covid-19 is a genuine seasonal disease becomes increasingly central, with implications for determining effective intervention measures,"" said Xavier Rodo, director of the Climate and Health programme at ISGlobal and coordinator of the study. The researchers first analysed the association of temperature and humidity in the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 spread in 162 countries across five continents, before changes in human behaviour and public health policies were put into place. The results show a negative relationship between the transmission rate (R0) and both temperature and humidity at the global scale, the researchers said. Higher transmission rates were associated with lower temperatures and humidity, they said. The researchers then analysed how this association between climate and disease evolved over time, and whether it was consistent at different geographical scales. They used a statistical method that was specifically developed to identify similar patterns of variation at different windows of time. The team found a strong negative association for short time windows between the number of cases and temperature and humidity. The patterns were consistent during the first, second and third waves of the pandemic at different spatial scales: worldwide, countries, down to individual regions within highly affected countries and even to the city level. The first epidemic waves waned as temperature and humidity rose, and the second wave rose as temperatures and humidity fell, according to the researchers. However, this pattern was broken during summertime in all continents, they said. ""This could be explained by several factors, including mass gatherings of young people, tourism, and air conditioning, among others,"" said Alejandro Fontal, researcher at ISGlobal and first author of the study. When adapting the model to analyse transient correlations at all scales in countries in the Southern Hemisphere, where the virus arrived later, the same negative correlation was observed. The climate effects were most evident at temperatures between 12 degrees and 18 degrees Celsius and humidity levels between 4 and 12 grammes per cubic metre (g/m3). However, the study authors warned that these ranges are still indicative, given the short records available. Using an epidemiological model, the researcher showed that incorporating temperature into the transmission rate works better for predicting the rise and fall of the different waves, particularly the first and third ones in Europe. ""Altogether, our findings support the view of Covid-19 as a true seasonal low-temperature infection, similar to influenza and to the more benign circulating coronaviruses,"" Rodo said. This seasonality could contribute importantly to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, since low humidity conditions have been shown to reduce the size of aerosols, and thereby increase airborne transmission of seasonal viruses such as influenza. ""This link warrants an emphasis on 'air hygiene' through improved indoor ventilation as aerosols are capable to persist suspended for longer times,"" said Rodo. The study highlights the need to include meteorological parameters in the evaluation and planning of control measures.

(the “Company”) (Nasdaq: ALLK), a biotechnology company developing investigational medicine lirentelimab (AK002) for the treatment of eosinophil and mast cell-related diseases, today announced that its poster, “High Discovery Rate of Eosinophilic Gastritis and/or Duodenitis Among Patients with Chronic Unexplained Gastrointestinal Symptoms,” received a Presidential Poster Award at the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) 2021 Annual Scientific Meeting. The poster reports the results from a prospective study which examined the rates of elevated tissue eosinophils in over 400 patients with moderate-severe unexplained gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, most of whom had a diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) or a functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID) such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or functional dyspepsia (FD). Millions of people in the U.S. suffer with chronic, unexplained GI symptoms, which can dramatically impact quality of life. The results suggest that EG/EoD may be an underrecognized cause of chronic unexplained GI symptoms, and that systematic evaluation for EG/EoD, including a standardized biopsy and histopathology method, is warranted in these patients. “In recent clinical studies, we’ve seen that many patients previously diagnosed with a functional GI disorder or those with moderate-to-severe unexplained symptoms met the strict histologic criteria for EG/EoD. It is increasingly evident that we should be systematically evaluating patients with chronic moderate-severe unexplained GI symptoms for EG/EoD, as there may be many patients who are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed with another GI condition,” said Dr. Nicholas Talley, Laureate Professor Global Research at the University of Newcastle, Australia and Adjunct Professor of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. “We anticipate the findings from this study will be critical in shaping future diagnostic guidelines for how patients with chronic, unexplained moderate-to-severe GI symptoms are evaluated.” “Diagnosis of eosinophilic gastritis and/or eosinophilic duodenitis is achieved through a clinicopathologic evaluation, highlighting the need for education among both gastroenterologists and pathologists,” said Dr. Evan Dellon, Professor of Medicine and Epidemiology, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, North Carolina. “These findings further demonstrate that deliberate counting of eosinophils under high-power magnification may improve detection of this disease and help more patients achieve a precise diagnosis. This is not always part of the current pathologic exam, and taking this step likely improves the chances of diagnosis after endoscopy.” About Eosinophilic Gastritis and/or Eosinophilic Duodenitis Eosinophilic gastritis and/or eosinophilic duodenitis (EG/EoD) is a chronic, often severe, inflammatory disease characterized by persistent gastrointestinal symptoms and elevated and activated eosinophils in the stomach and/or, duodenum, respectively. Emerging data suggests that activated mast cells also contribute to disease pathogenesis. Common symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, bloating, cramping, early satiety, loss of appetite, vomiting and weight loss. Published literature reports the prevalence of eosinophilic gastritis and/or eosinophilic duodenitis in the United States to be approximately 50,000 people. The Company believes that EG/EoD may be significantly underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed as other gastrointestinal diseases. The results from this study suggest that EG/EoD may be more common than documented in the literature. There are no treatments approved specifically for EG/EoD. Treatment with systemic steroids can provide symptomatic improvement. However, long-term treatment with steroids is generally not possible due to the numerous side effects. About Lirentelimab Development in EG/EoD Lirentelimab (AK002), is an investigational medicine that targets Siglec-8, an inhibitory receptor selectively expressed on human mast cells and eosinophils. Lirentelimab has been studied in a prospective, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, Phase 2 Study in patients with EG/EoD (ENIGMA). In ENIGMA, all lirentelimab dose arms showed statistical significance when compared to placebo across all prespecified primary and secondary endpoints, including reductions in gastrointestinal tissue eosinophil counts and patient-reported disease symptoms. In this study, lirentelimab was generally well tolerated and the only treatment emergent adverse event occurring more frequently on lirentelimab than on placebo was mild to moderate infusion-related reactions. Treatment emergent SAEs occurred in 9% of patients on lirentelimab versus 14% on placebo. Detailed results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine on October 22, 2020. A Phase 3 Study of lirentelimab in patients with EG/EoD (NCT04322604) and a Phase 2/3 Study in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis (NCT04322708) are ongoing. Topline data from these studies are expected in the fourth quarter of 2021. About Allakos Allakos is a clinical stage biotechnology company developing antibodies that target immunomodulatory receptors present on immune effector cells involved in allergic, inflammatory, and proliferative diseases. The Company’s lead antibody, lirentelimab (AK002), is being evaluated in a Phase 3 study in eosinophilic gastritis (EG) and/or eosinophilic duodenitis (EoD) and a Phase 2/3 study in eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). Lirentelimab targets Siglec-8, an inhibitory receptor selectively expressed on human mast cells and eosinophils. Inappropriately activated eosinophils and mast cells have been identified as key drivers in a number of severe diseases affecting the gastrointestinal tract, eyes, skin, lungs and other organs.

New advice issued by Dorset's public health chief amid rising covid cases,https://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/news/19671074.new-advice-issued-dorsets-public-health-chief-amid-rising-covid-cases/?ref=rss,,,,THE DIRECTOR of Public Health Dorset has issued new advice following a 'rapid' rise in covid cases.,,2021-10-25 13:59:15,"""In other parts of the South West we're seeing councils with cases reaching seven and eight hundred cases per hundred thousand, so we need to do something differently and we need to understand that the situation is changing."" Mr Crowe said local hospital admissions have started to climb despite 'holding fairly steady in the last week.' He added: ""Not all of these infections are linked with schools, although we have high infection rates in school-aged children. They're now starting to affect older age groups so we're seeing infections in parents and we're also seeing this spread into older age groups and that's the concern."" ""In our local system which is already really stressed, we don't have much room for manoeuvre. Any additional admissions due to covid just put more pressure on the hospital system, which is really trying hard to catch up with all of those people who have had delays to their urgent treatment during the pandemic."" Mr Crowe has asked the public to do three things to prevent cases from rising further: ""Know your risk and understand that this is changing quite quickly with rising cases so think about those additional measures you can take to protect yourself and others. ""I'm asking you to act: airborne transmission is really crucial that's how the virus spreads, so think about those measures that can prevent that happening. If you're meeting indoors remember to keep doors and windows open, ventilation is really crucial. Wear a mask if you're mixing with other people you wouldn't normally mix with in enclosed indoor areas and remember the importance of distance as well. ""Finally protect, so remember lateral flow testing is really important for spotting early cases and asymptomatic cases of covid. Also, if you haven't had your vaccination or you're not up to date with your second jab, please do look out for those opportunities to get fully vaccinated."" Mr Crowe also addressed the roll out of the booster vaccination programme in Dorset asking those who have been contacted, to ""please take up that opportunity."" In a final statement the Public Health Dorset Director said: ""Over the next few weeks, I'm just asking you to do all you can to try to help us keep a lid on our cases. ""None of us want to go back to that situation where we saw restrictions being brought in, we've got a small window now where if we act together, hopefully we can stave off the need to bring in more serious measures further down the line. So, let's keep going thank you.""",https://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/resources/images/13135837/,dorsetecho

The Center will be dedicated to bringing nursing, business, liberal arts, education and other academic and support programs together to increase the pipeline of opportunity and augment the supply of nurses and nursing support in the Appalachian Highlands. The Center will develop partnerships with other colleges and universities, such as Emory & Henry College, Milligan University, Northeast State Community College, Tusculum University and the University of Virginia’s College at Wise, among others, to advance the clinical practice of nursing, enhance interprofessional collaboration, contribute to knowledge about nursing workflow and generate nursing scholarship and innovation. Even prior to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the nation faced a shortage of nurses, with more than 1 million nurses expected to retire before 2030, according to a study published in Medical Care . Combining this with the historically high acuity of hospitalized patients creates a high-stress situation for practicing nurses, leading to burnout and higher turnover rates. “As the largest nursing program in the state of Tennessee and as an institution whose mission is to improve the lives of the people of our region, we are excited about the opportunity Ballad Health has created to increase this vital pipeline of nurses, while also seeking to provide support and ongoing enhancement of our existing workforce,” said ETSU President Dr. Brian Noland. “ETSU is poised to continue to meet the challenge of the nursing shortage through the Center for Nursing Advancement, which will be rooted in our strong service, teaching and research missions.” The Appalachian Highlands Center for Nursing Advancement will focus on data and research, collaboration with key stakeholders across the region and advocacy to promote the nursing profession. “Our nurses and their direct support teams, such as certified nursing assistants, licensed practical nurses and the other allied health professionals who care directly for patients are the heart of the healthcare team,” said Ballad Health Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Alan Levine. “The dynamics of the nursing profession have changed so much, becoming even more complex because of the challenges of the pandemic. We now seek to learn from our nurses what we need to do to evolve to better support the needs of our nursing teams and enhance their resilience in a very difficult environment, and partnerships with these regional institutions of higher education within the Appalachian Highlands are just the beginning of this collaborative effort to invest in healthcare workforce development.” Not only will the Center work with current nurses and nursing students, but it will also seek to attract more students to the nursing profession. The Center will partner with other institutions to develop a common pipeline for high school students to identify those with aptitudes for the sciences and help match them with employment and pathways to certification as a nursing support professional or for a nursing degree. These programs could match students with jobs within Ballad Health while they’re in high school, which provide a path to certification by their high school graduations, linking them with the possibility of scholarships for nursing degrees, as well as employment opportunities within Ballad Health. “Inspiring and educating the next generation of nurses and nurse educators is perhaps more important now than it has ever been,” said Dr. Leann Horsley, dean of ETSU’s College of Nursing. “The Appalachian Highlands Center for Nursing Advancement will be critical to laying the groundwork for tomorrow’s nursing workforce in our region and ensuring that not only do we overcome the challenges of the pandemic, but that we also are proactive in creating a resilient and well-prepared workforce that can meet the future needs of our region as it grows.” “The last year and a half have brought tremendous attention to the field of nursing and our nursing professionals, and with that, wider recognition of the long-looming national nursing shortage,” said Dr. Lisa Smithgall, Ballad Health’s chief nursing executive. “Just as it’s taken a community effort to address and mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s going to take a wide-reaching effort to overcome this shortage in frontline caregivers and develop a robust, farsighted effort to build out the nursing workforce for the coming generations.” Support from throughout the region and State of Tennessee The announcement of the creation of the Center has drawn support from throughout the Appalachian Highlands and in Nashville. “The nation is facing a labor shortage with profound impacts on health care,” said Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee. “Ballad Health is investing into East Tennessee State University to develop the Appalachian Highlands Center for Nursing Advancement which will not only serve the needs of the Appalachian Highland region, but the entire state. My administration looks forward to working with Ballad Health and ETSU as they build solutions to the national nursing shortage.” “Milligan University has long been a reliable provider of allied health and nursing professionals to the region, and we are enthusiastic about participating with ETSU and our other colleagues throughout the region to contribute to the goals of the Center,” said Dr. Bill Greer, president of Milligan University. “The University of Virginia’s College at Wise values our partnership with Ballad Health and our colleague institutions, as we all have worked together to provide solutions for the Appalachian Highlands,” said Dr. Donna Henry, chancellor of UVA Wise. “We look forward to being a part of the Center and to contributing to the growth and enhancement of the nursing profession as we seek to grow our own programs.” “Emory and Henry College has been the beneficiary of the generosity of Ballad Health in the past, resulting in a fantastic allied health program infrastructure, and we are excited about this next major investment Ballad Health is making in advancing nursing as a profession,” said Dr. John Wells, president of Emory and Henry College. “Our nursing students and alumni have made a profound difference in patients and the region’s health thanks, in large measure, to a long and productive relationship with Ballad Health,” said Dr. Scott Hummel, Tusculum University’s president. “Tusculum is proud to serve the Appalachian Highlands, and we are excited about partnering with Ballad Health and other higher education institutions through this collaborative approach to assist the nursing profession in the region.” “We are excited to be part of a robust nursing pipeline in our community,” said Dr. Bethany Bullock, president of Northeast State Community College. “At Northeast State, we are committed to working alongside our academic partners and Ballad Health to increase and enhance the health care workforce in the Appalachian Highlands.” More information about the ETSU College of Nursing is available at www.etsu.edu, and open nursing jobs with Ballad Health are listed at www.balladhealth.org/careers. ### About Ballad Health Ballad Health is an integrated community health improvement organization serving 29 counties of the Appalachian Highlands in Northeast Tennessee, Southwest Virginia, Northwest North Carolina and Southeast Kentucky.

Ontario lifts more capacity limits as province reports 326 new COVID-19 cases . SECOND OPINION | Why 'waning immunity' from COVID-19 vaccines isn't as bad as it sounds. Track how many people have been given the COVID-19 vaccine across Canada . Ontario is lifting capacity limits today at restaurants, gyms, casinos and some other locations where proof of vaccination against COVID-19 is required. If museums and galleries, places of worship and personal care settings choose to require proof of vaccination, they can also lift capacity limits as of today. Premier Doug Ford announced the development Friday as he unveiled plans for managing the pandemic long term. The province aims to remove all public health measures meant to slow the spread of COVID-19 by late March, including mask mandates. Proof-of-vaccination requirements will start to be lifted early next year — as long as trends don't become concerning — starting with restaurants, bars, gyms and casinos in January. Health officials in Ontario — where daily case numbers have been trending downward — on Monday reported 326 new cases of COVID-19 and no additional deaths. - From The Canadian Press, last updated at 10:30 a.m. ET What's happening in Canada WATCH | Military help comes to Sask. as calls for COVID-19 restrictions continue: Military help comes to Sask. as calls for COVID-19 restrictions continue 14 hours ago 1:49 The calls for COVID-19 restrictions in Saskatchewan continue as military personnel arrive to support the overwhelmed hospitals that are sending ICU patients to Ontario daily. 1:49 COVID-19 on the agenda as fall Alberta legislature sitting set to begin.

What's happening around the world People wait in line to get a COVID-19 vaccine during a weekend-long 'marathon of vaccination' at the National Library in Bucharest, Romania, on Sunday. (Daneil Mihailescu/AFP/Getty Images) As of early Monday morning, more than 243.7 million cases of COVID-19 had been reported worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University's coronavirus tracking tool. The reported global death toll stood at more than 4.9 million. In Europe , the Romanian government will re-introduce a night curfew and make health passes mandatory for entry to most public venues from Monday. Meanwhile, Russia reported another daily record of confirmed coronavirus cases Monday as a surge in infections has prompted the Kremlin to tell most people to stay away from work starting later this week. The Russian government's coronavirus task force tallied 37,930 new confirmed cases in 24 hours, the highest number since the start of the pandemic. The task force also reported 1,069 more COVID-19 deaths in the same period, slightly fewer than a record of 1,075 reached over the weekend. Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered Russians not to go to work between Oct. 30 and Nov. 7, when the country will observe an extended holiday. During that time, most state organizations and private businesses, except for those operating key infrastructure and a few others, are to halt work. In the Asia-Pacific region, children as young as three will start receiving COVID-19 vaccines in China, where 76 per cent of the population has been fully vaccinated and authorities are maintaining a zero-tolerance policy toward outbreaks. Local city and provincial level governments in at least five provinces issued notices in recent days announcing that children ages three to 11 will be required to get their vaccinations. INTERACTIVE | Where is the coronavirus pandemic getting better or worse? The expansion of the vaccination campaign comes as parts of China bring in new measures to try to stamp out small outbreaks. Gansu, a northwestern province heavily dependent on tourism, closed all tourist sites Monday after finding new COVID-19 cases. Residents in parts of Inner Mongolia have been ordered to stay indoors due to an outbreak there. The National Health Commission reported 35 new cases of local transmission had been detected over the past 24 hours, four of them in Gansu. Another 19 cases were found in the Inner Mongolia region, with others scattered around the country. In Papua New Guinea, concerted international action is needed as a surge in COVID-19 cases overwhelms the Pacific country's health system, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said on Monday. Meanwhile, South Korea said it has achieved its goal of vaccinating 70 per cent of its 52 million people, paving the way for a planned return to normal next month. In the Middle East , in the United Arab Emirates, health officials on Monday reported one additional death and 97 new cases of COVID-19. In the Americas , White House chief medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci said Americans can choose a booster shot that is different from their original inoculation — but the recommendation is to stick with the vaccine they got first if it is available. In Africa , Tunisia imposed COVID-19 vaccine passes on Tunisians and all foreign visitors. Officials, employees and users are required to show their vaccine pass to access public and private administrations. -From Reuters, The Associated Press and CBC News, last updated at 10:35 a.m. ET",,cbc

The newspaper says that in a memo marked “official – sensitive”, the agency stated that it was urgently seeking the views of council chief executives and leaders to be fed directly into the Cabinet Office. “This is a tight turnaround as you might appreciate and so a response by close of play would be really helpful,” it states. A UKHSA spokesperson is quoted as saying it would not comment on leaks, adding: “It is part of UKHSA’s role to provide advice to the government on the ongoing response to the pandemic.” A government spokesperson is reported to have said: “We are monitoring all the data closely, and the prime minister has been clear that it does not yet show that plan B is necessary. But it is ready should we need to act to avoid a rise in hospitalisations which would put unsustainable pressure on the NHS.”",https://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/resources/images/12716809/,dorsetecho

"Kids with obesity need acceptance from family and friends, not just better diet tips, to succeed at managing their weight",https://theconversation.com/kids-with-obesity-need-acceptance-from-family-and-friends-not-just-better-diet-tips-to-succeed-at-managing-their-weight-168908,,"['Amanda Harrist', ' Professor in Human Development and Family Science', ' Oklahoma State University']",,,"Obesity intervention programs tend to focus on healthy food and physical activity. But is that enough? kali9/E+ Collection via Getty ImagesHundreds of programs over the past four decades – from the removal of junk food from school vending machines to Michelle Obama’s “Let’s Move” campaign – have tried to get kids in the U.S. to eat healthier food and exercise more often. But none of these efforts lowered national child obesity rates. In fact, child obesity has continued to increase. This has been particularly true during the pandemic. We think we know why. Most programs that seek to lower children’s body mass index, or BMI, focus on healthy food and physical activity. But as child obesity researchers who specialize in human development and family science, we know that slimming down requires much more than attention to diet and exercise. Those factors are important, but we found that acceptance from family and friends also plays a critical role in slowing the rate of weight gain for children with obesity. To reach this conclusion, we collaborated with colleagues to follow almost 1,200 children in first through fourth grades in rural Oklahoma to find out more about the lives of kids who are overweight or obese. Our intervention programs allowed us to compare a traditional food and exercise approach to managing child obesity with approaches that also targeted the social and emotional aspects of children’s lives. Family and peer acceptance We conducted a randomized controlled trial in 29 Oklahoma schools. More than 500 first graders who were at-risk for obesity – meaning their BMI was above the 75th percentile – were assigned to either a control group or a group that received a combination of three interventions. These interventions focused on family lifestyle, family dynamics and the peer group. [Explore the intersection of faith, politics, arts and culture. Sign up for This Week in Religion.] The family lifestyle intervention focused on healthy food and physical activity. Participants learned to use a color-coded food reference guide similar to this one when selecting food. Parents tracked their children’s food consumption and physical activity, and also learned how to avoid conflict over food. This conflict might involve arguing about how much the child is eating, whether the child can have dessert or whether the child has eaten enough of everything else on the table to get a second helping of a favorite food. The family dynamics intervention added parenting skills and healthy emotion management. Children’s emotion regulation and emotional eating are significantly related, so teaching children to manage their feelings may reduce their tendency to eat when they are stressed out or upset. Children were taught how to deal with negative emotions, express their feelings and value their uniqueness. Parents were taught to value their children’s emotions, provide comfort and understanding, support children’s problem-solving and accept their children as they are. The peer group intervention taught social acceptance in the children’s school classrooms. Our research has shown that the more children weigh, the more their classmates tend to dislike them. However we’ve also demonstrated that we can decrease the rejection that happens in elementary school classrooms by teaching children to be more accepting of one another. Teaching kids to be more accepting of one another can reduce weight stigma and rejection. kali9/E+ Collection via Getty Images Effect on obesity We measured children’s heights and weights at the beginning of first grade and then after the intervention – in first, second, third and fourth grades. Only those children with obesity who received all three interventions – family lifestyle, family dynamics and peer group – had significant decreases in BMI gains compared with the control group. Ongoing analysis indicates that the peer group intervention was particularly important for children who were severely obese, with a BMI in the 99th percentile. Our results show that to reduce BMI gains in the early school years, kids need more than healthy food and physical activity. They need parents who encourage their healthy choices and accept their emotions. Knowing you can come home and talk about how angry and sad you are is essential to healthy physical and mental growth. And children must also have friends and peers who accept them for who they are – regardless of how much they weigh.

Prepping your oven for the holidays in the last week of October may seem like overkill, but repairmen can be hard to schedule (getting you out to your home can take weeks!), and it’s best to identify any oven issues well ahead of time so as not to add to your peak holiday stress. Check your oven for potential issues now, and you’ll have plenty of time to fix them before pie baking season. Make sure it’s not lying with an oven thermometer First, make sure your oven isn’t a lying liar that lies. Baking things is something of a trust exercise: You press some buttons to set the temperature, the oven tells you when it has reached that temperature, and you put the food in the oven, never questioning the veracity of the appliance’s claim. Being off by a few degrees isn’t the biggest deal, especially if all you’re doing is roasting vegetables and baking potatoes. But larger temperature discrepancies can cause problems, especially with more finicky baking projects, dishes with long cook times (like the giant ceremonial bird), and new recipes. Checking the accuracy of your oven’s temperature display is very easy: Get an oven thermometer and use it. Your oven’s internal thermometer only reads the temp of the location where it was installed, usually towards the back or in the front. Food, as you know, doesn’t get cooked in the back or front of the oven — it gets cooked in the centre. So grab an external thermometer and place it there. (Brand-wise, Cook’s Illustrated recommends this basic, very cheap dial face model, but you can also use a digital probe model, like this one from Thermoworks.) Set your thermometer (or thermometer probe) in the centre of your oven and set the temperature to 350℉. Once the oven says it’s heated to the target temperature, check your thermometer and write the actual reading down. Repeat every 15 minutes for two hours, then take the average by adding all the readings together and dividing that sum by the number of readings — that’s your oven temperature. (Averaging will account for any fluctuations caused by cycling, i.e., your oven turning off and on to maintain the target temp.) If your oven has been lying all along, you can set it straight by adjusting your oven’s temperature dial. The steps involved will be slightly different for every make and model of oven, so check your owner’s manual. (ThermPro has an outline for the procedure here, but I cannot guarantee it’s geared to the oven in your kitchen.) Check for hot spots with coconut and bread Even if your oven is giving accurate temperature readouts, it’s unlikely the whole oven is the exact same temp in every single spot. Most ovens have hot spots and cold spots, and you can map them using shredded coconut. To make a map, set your oven to 180ºC and scatter some shredded coconut on a sheet pan in an even layer. Place the sheet pan in the oven, and take note of which spots brown the fastest (and the slowest). If you want to map your broiler in a similar fashion, grab a bunch of sliced bread, lay it out on a sheet pan (or directly on the rack) and give the slices a broil, taking note of which pieces brown the fastest. Consult the maps as needed to prevent your delicious dishes from overcooking, undercooking, or flat-out burning Clean the damn thing If you do nothing else to prepare your oven for the holidays, at least give it a deep clean. Old, stuck-on food and grimy oil spots can smoke or catch fire and ruin your food (and — in some extreme cases — your entire oven), so get rid of them. The self-cleaning function can be used sparingly to incinerate built-up gunk (make sure all grease is wiped out first so you don’t start a oil fire), but if yours doesn’t have one of those, or you don’t want to use it, you can get the job done with ammonia, dish soap, and baking soda.

"More than 9 out of 10 workers comply with vaccine mandates, but some remain defiant",https://abc30.com/vaccine-mandate-covid-mandates-vaccines-biden/11162552/,,['AP'],,These defiant workers have the potential to create disruptions in a tight labor market.,,2021-10-24 15:07:05,"BATH, Maine -- Josh ""Chevy"" Chevalier is a third-generation shipbuilder who hasn't missed a day of work during the pandemic in his job as a welder constructing Navy warships on the Maine coast. But he's ready to walk away from his job because of an impending mandate from President Joe Biden that federal contractors and all U.S. businesses with 100 or more workers be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. ""People are fighting for their constitutional rights - the way they think their life should be,"" said Chevalier, one of hundreds of employees at Bath Iron Works threatening to leave. Chevalier is among a small but significant number of American workers deciding whether to quit their jobs and careers in defiance of what they consider intrusive edicts that affect their freedoms. The Biden administration, public health officials and many business leaders agree that , prudent actions necessary to help the world emerge from a pandemic that has killed more than 700,000 Americans and nearly 5 million people worldwide. The defiant workers make up a small fraction of the overall workforce, with many cities, states and businesses reporting that more than 9 out of 10 of their workers are complying with mandates. But they have the potential to create disruptions in a tight labor market and have become the latest roadblock in overcoming the vaccine hesitancy that allowed the COVID-19 crisis to take a devastating turn over the summer. In many cases, the reasons for the objections are rooted in misinformation. The refusers come from all types of occupations - defense industry workers, police officers, firefighters, educators and health care workers. In Seattle, a group of city firefighters turned in their boots at City Hall on Tuesday to protest a vaccination requirement. Thousands of people have sought religious or medical exemptions that were rejected; others won't stand to be told what to do and have quit or been fired. , the football coach at Washington State University, was let go from his $3.2 million-a-year job on Monday, along with four assistants. Rolovich, the first major college coach to lose his job over vaccination status, claimed a religious exemption but has declined to elaborate. He is suing. The conflict over mandates is likely to grow in the coming weeks. The Biden administration is expected to move forward any day with the mandate that employers with 100 or more workers require all employees be vaccinated or undergo weekly testing, though enforcement likely won't start for several weeks. The rule for federal contractors goes into effect in December, with no testing option, but many businesses, governments and schools are already implementing mandates. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other groups that represent large employers have warned workers might simply migrate to jobs at smaller businesses where they don't face vaccination requirements. That could create challenges for large retailers going into the holiday season, among other disruptions, the chamber warned. Individuals who've left their jobs and are seeking work that doesn't require vaccinations are sharing information on social media. Small employers looking for workers are turning to online job boards such as RedBalloon, where employers sign a pledge that they won't make vaccines a condition for hiring. Andrew Crapuchettes, RedBalloon's founder and chief executive, said he started the online job board more than two months ago for people ""who just want to work and don't want to get into politics in the office."" More than 800 companies have posted, and more than 250,000 people have visited the site, he said. Some states, , Montana and Florida, are gearing up to fight or undercut the Biden mandates. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued an executive order Monday barring any entity from requiring vaccines. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Thursday he will call a special session to pass legislation to combat vaccine mandates, saying that, ""in Florida, your right to earn a living is not contingent upon whatever choices you're making in terms of these injections."" Melissa Alfieri-Collins, a 44-year-old mother of two, said she resigned from her job as a nurse at Jersey Shore Medical Center in Neptune, New Jersey, rather than undergo regular COVID-19 testing. She said the hospital recognized her request for a medical exemption, but she objected to the requirement that only unvaccinated people get tested, arguing that even vaccinated people can spread disease. ""My family and I, we had a long talk, and I basically don't want to compromise my values any more,"" said Alfieri-Collins, who hopes to become a nurse practitioner and pursue her own holistic practice. ""I am very sad because I am the type of nurse that loves my patients and my patients love me,"" she said. Anthony Polenski, director of strategic partnerships for tech recruiting company Jobfuture.ai, said he's seeing candidates who want to know, ""Will this company force me to take a jab?"" Polenski said they are often leaving previous employers because of a vaccine mandate. ""They don't want their vaccination status attached to their employment,"" he said. At the shipyard in Maine, frustration is rising among union members. On Friday, some 100 shipbuilders gathered outside the shipyard during their lunch break to protest being forced to get vaccinated. They marched down the street, holding signs decrying the mandate and using choice four-letter words that made clear what they think of the president and his vaccine mandates. The union fears it could lose more than 1,000 workers, or 30% of its membership, over the federal contractor mandate. Dean Grazioso, a 33-year Bath Iron Works employee, said he's not anti-vaccine but that he knows vaccinated coworkers, friends and family members who've contracted breakthrough COVID-19 infections.

However, they will face two weeks of hotel quarantine upon arrival and be subject to regular Covid tests. For fully jabbed stars, though, will have ‘complete freedom of movement’ provided they test negative before and after arrival in Victoria. The email – shared by New York Times reporter Ben Rothenberg – adds: “Tennis Australia has asked us to wait a few days before speaking about it as they were still working with the government on the details. “Because Victoria’s vaccination rate will hit 80 per cent at the end of the week and 90 per cent next month, it has been confirmed that conditions for players at the Australian Open will improve significantly.” LATEST IN SUN BINGO AND VEGAS FREE BONUS Join Sun Vegas now to get £10 free with no deposit required £1M PRIZE DRAW Win a share of £1 MILLION with Sun Bingo in October from just £10 per entry NEW GAME Play Sun Bingo's exciting new fast-paced slots and 50-ball Slingo game now FAB FIVER Fabulous Bingo new customer offer: Get free £5 bonus with no deposit required   JOIN SUN VEGAS: GET A FREE £10 BONUS WITH 100s OF GAMES TO PLAY AND NO DEPOSIT REQUIRED (Ts&Cs apply) The news comes just a week after Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews suggested unvaccinated players would be denied entry into Australia. Andrews said: “I don’t think any unvaccinated tennis player is going to get a visa to come into this country. “If they did get a visa, they’d probably have to quarantine for a couple of weeks when no other players will have to. “(The virus) doesn’t care what your tennis ranking is, or how many Grand Slams you’ve won. “It’s completely irrelevant. You need to be vaccinated to keep yourself safe and to keep others safe.” Djokovic was at the centre of a Covid storm early on during the pandemic when he hosted the infamous Adria Tour, complete with nightclub parties, with no social distancing as many players and participants contracted the virus – including himself. The ace won three of the four Majors in 2021 to tie level with Federer and Nadal before defeat to Daniil Medvedev in the US Open final last month.

Did Covid-19 lead to extinction of Influenza B virus?,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/covid-19-influenza-b-virus-extinct-india-vaccine-who-cdc-1869131-2021-10-25?utm_source=rss,,,,Did Covid-19 lead to extinction of Influenza B virus?,,2021-10-25 10:35:39,"While coronavirus has emerged as the worst havoc in modern times, the pandemic may have silently led to the extinction of an influenza virus, which has been a seasonal epidemic in several parts of the world. There has been a notable reduction in influenza cases since the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. One particular flu viral infection agent, the B/Yamagata lineage of Influenza B virus, was not detected from April 2020 to August 2021. According to a research paper published in Nature Reviews microbiology , the developments suggest that influenza lineage may have become extinct, which may provide opportunities for improving the availability and effectiveness of influenza vaccines. Reportedly, detection of Influenza virus cases dropped significantly from April 2020 with a ""99 per cent reduction compared with previous years despite roughly similar levels of testing."" ""The genetic diversity of influenza viruses has also dramatically diminished. The number of cases detected has fallen for both influenza A (H3N2) and A (H1N1) subtypes, and, similarly, diversity has diminished for the B/Victoria lineage,"" the paper stated. The paper, however, also noted that the IBV lineages have been known to periodically enter a state of ""dormancy"" for long time intervals. Influenza B was mostly undetected globally during the 1990s, except for an outbreak in Asia. WHAT IS THE INFLUENZA VIRUS? Influenza is a group of viruses that leads to contagious respiratory illness infecting the nose, throat, and at times lungs. There are four types of seasonal influenza viruses, types A, B, C and D. Influenza A viruses are further classified into subtype A (H1N1) and A (H3N2). According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), Influenza B viruses are not classified into subtypes but can be broken down into lineages. Currently circulating influenza type B viruses belong to either B/Yamagata or B/Victoria lineage. The initial symptoms of Influenza include sudden onset of fever, cough, headache, muscle and joint pain, sore throat and a runny nose. While most people recover in a couple of weeks, severe cases may lead to death. WHAT COULD HAVE TRIGGERED A REDUCTION IN CASES? Researchers have said that the global circulation patterns of influenza viruses have been associated with age-specific patterns of infection. Pregnant women, children under 59 months, the elderly, individuals with chronic medical conditions are at a higher risk of being affected by the virus. Led by Marios Koutsakos of the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Melbourne, the researchers speculate that behavioural changes (social distancing, mask-wearing and hygiene measures), travel and movement restrictions could be the major factors driving the reduction in influenza incidence. ""The reduction in global movement due to the Covid-19 pandemic may have contributed to low distribution and seeding of B/Yamagata and with B/Victoria prevalence increasing since 2019, B/Yamagata may have already been at a low prevalence cycle at the beginning of the pandemic,"" the paper added. Meanwhile, the reduction in cases could bode well for the health sector, which now has more vaccines to fight fewer strains of the virus and work on improving the effectiveness of the doses in fighting those remaining strains.",,indiatoday

And also, what’s the difference between a booster and a third dose? This and more in the latest video. On 18th October, Malaysia has fully vaccinated 22.9 million individuals which is equivalent to 70.2% of the total population. This puts Malaysia ahead of several developed nations including Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, South Korea and the United States in terms of fully vaccinated rates. Perbezaan antara dos tambahan dan dos penggalak. #BoosterShots #vaccinated pic.twitter.com/YGMSQXsJvs— KKMalaysia (@KKMPutrajaya) October 15, 2021 Malaysia has begun offering booster shots for senior citizens and high-risk groups. A booster shot is administered to fully vaccinated individuals who have gotten sufficient protection earlier but the protection levels may wane over time. For Pfizer recipients, a booster shot is given 6 months after individuals are fully vaccinated. Meanwhile, individuals who have been fully vaccinated with Sinovac are also eligible to receive Pfizer as the booster shot at least 3 months after getting the second dose. The third dose is defined as additional doses for people who are immunocompromised as they may not have sufficient immune response after receiving two doses of the vaccine. This includes cancer patients, organ recipients, kidney patients who require dialysis and individuals who can’t get enough protection from the standard two-dose vaccination. The third dose will be administered at least 28 days after receiving the second dose. As more travel restrictions are being lifted, Malaysia is currently conducting a “test and release” pilot programme where individuals returning to Malaysia may skip quarantine. The pilot program is currently open to rulers, ministers, members of Parliament and government officials travelling overseas, and it is expected to be extended to business travellers. To participate in the pilot programme, eligible individuals must submit supporting documents to the National Security Council and the Ministry of Health. A mandatory RT-PCR test is required 3 days before departing for Malaysia and another test at the entry point upon arrival in the country. The test and release pilot is only applicable for individuals travelling to low-risk countries. As more teenagers are getting vaccinated, the cinema SOPs have been revised to allow all fully vaccinated individuals regardless of age to enter. This is applicable to Sarawak and states under Phase 4 of the National Recovery Plan.

Australia's 'underclass' don't like work? Our research shows  vulnerable job seekers don't get the help they need,https://theconversation.com/australias-underclass-dont-like-work-our-research-shows-vulnerable-job-seekers-dont-get-the-help-they-need-169609,,"[""Siobhan O'Sullivan"", ' Associate professor', ' UNSW']",,,"James Ross/AAPFormer NSW minister Pru Goward wrote a column in the Australian Financial Review last week about Australia’s “underclass,” who she says are lazy, dysfunctional and don’t like the “discipline” of work. This was condemned by anti-poverty advocates as disturbing, but it was not terribly surprising. Australia has a long history of stigmatising those without work. The idea that unemployed people are work-shy is also conveyed in one of Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s catchphrases: “the best form of welfare is a job”. But this is not always a straightforward proposition. In our upcoming book, Buying and Selling the Poor, we tell the story of the offices and frontline staff who work with the most vulnerable job seekers. We wanted to find out why some employment agencies do better at helping very disadvantaged people find jobs, given that the welfare-to-work system has such a high failure rate when it comes to the long-term unemployed. Welfare-to-work in Australia Australia has the world’s only fully privatised welfare-to-work system. It is a multibillion dollar industry, involving about 40 private agencies who help job seekers become “job ready” through training and face-to-face meetings with case managers. To receive unemployment payments, you must be also be looking for work. Dan Peled/AAP The system has a reputation for being efficient – a 2019 parliamentary report noted there had been more than one million job placements since mid-2015. Indeed, most of those on JobSeeker (unemployment) payments are only temporarily out of work due to factors like layoffs, economic downturns in their industry, or the nature of casual work. But there are also hundreds of thousands of Australians for whom unemployment lasts years. These are people who may not have worked for a long time because of caring responsibilities, disability or illness. Others may have limited education or complex issues such as addiction or homelessness. As the Reserve Bank reported in December 2020, around one in every five unemployed people have been unemployed for more than a year. This is up from around one in every eight a decade ago. Our study Our research was based on four job services agencies that were “high performing” in terms of getting long-term unemployed people into work. This included one in suburban Melbourne, one in outer Melbourne, another in Melbourne’s inner-city and a fourth in regional NSW. All four offices were among the top job services in Victoria and NSW based on the proportion of clients they had placing into jobs lasting 26 weeks or more in the year before our study (according to government data). Over 18 months from late 2016 to early 2018, we sat in these offices, watching and documenting all interactions for days at a time. We interviewed agency staff and followed the fate of about 100 disadvantaged clients (namely, job seekers who had been assessed by Centrelink as being least “job ready” and so needing the most employment support). No single winning formula Our study showed there is no singular underlying formula to help the most disadvantaged job seekers. Some offices displayed high levels of team work (with colleagues actively helping each other with clients), while others were more skilled at connecting with employers and took advantage of being close to centres of light industry and a good supply of suitable jobs. Read more: Our research shows more Australians receive unemployment payments than you think But, taken as a whole, the picture was one of relatively marginal returns. The difference between being an “average” and an “outstanding” provider of services to highly disadvantaged job seekers (based on government performance data) may be as low as placing one or two additional people a into a job that they hold for 26 weeks. This suggests the Australian system remains largely unable to reliably assist vulnerable job seekers. Problems right from the start When people first claim JobSeeker payments, Centrelink organises them into one of three service streams: A (most “job ready”), B or C (“hardest to help”). Stream C accounts for around 16% of job services’ caseload and about 44% of this group have been clients with employment services for more than five years. This categorisation is important - it determines the level of support (such as funding for training) a job seeker is eligible for. Providers also earn more for helping clients into work if they are in Stream C. Job services can easily get bogged down in paperwork. Stefan Postles/AAP Our work confirmed previous research, such as that of the Refugee Council of Australia – the tool used to classify job seekers is not an accurate measure of the real conditions for these clients. This is because job seekers are often reluctant to disclose deeply personal issues such as domestic violence or criminal records to strangers at Centrelink. As a result, job services then invest considerable energy having job seekers reclassified, or “up-streamed,” from an A to a B or C. This involves sending clients back to Centrelink for reassessment, which can take months and months. So there is less time spent connecting with people’s needs and more time doing administration. Staff with few specialist skills We also encountered a system staffed by people with little specialist skills and job security. When job services were privatised 30 years ago, many frontline staff came from a professional or social work background. Today, it is predominantly staffed by those without tertiary qualifications. Case workers are former hairdressers, bakers, flight attendants, hospitality workers and carpenters. Some have been long-term unemployed themselves. Read more: Robodebt was a fiasco with a cost we have yet to fully appreciate Some of the staff specifically told us their job is not to help solve job seekers’ personal problems and crises (they are not “counsellors”). The pay is low, the work can be stressful, with pressure to hit targets and little time to connect with people and the turnover is high. This inevitably means those who really need help are not necessarily receiving a specialist service. Some good news We also saw repeated examples of staff doing everything they could to make sure the system was not too brutal or indifferent to vulnerable people. While the computer-driven system prompts staff to penalise (which may result in docked payments) jobs seekers for misdemeanours as small as arriving late to appointments, we saw staff exercising compassion and finding ways around this. We saw staff who knew all the agencies’ clients by name and who worked as a team. If an employer had multiple vacancies, staff would place any and all “job-ready” job seekers into the position, regardless of who their official case manager was. A human heart still beats within the system. More change coming From mid-next year, right as the labour market tries to recover from COVID-19, a radical change is coming. Welfare-to-work will be done primarily online, with an app for case management. If this does not result in a job within 18 months, the job seeker – then classified as long-term unemployed – will likely be moved into a face-to-face system. Job services will become digitised from mid-2022. www.shutterstock.com The government says more money will be invested into programs for young people and skills training. But welfare advocates warn the old problems of “too little help and too much policing” will just be replicated in the new system. Moreover, what this digitisation will mean for vulnerable job seekers (particularly those who don’t have good computer skills or up-to-date technology) is yet to play out. Our study’s overall conclusion is the current system does not work for the most disadvantaged clients. The approach to helping people into work is transactional – even at the best of agencies. Whether a job is indeed the best form of welfare or not, this is far from easy to achieve for some Australians, even with the “assistance” of face-to-face employment services.

COVID-19 risks explained with new tool,https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-10-covid-tool.html,"['Diseases', 'Conditions', 'Syndromes']",,,A calculator to help people understand their risk factors for COVID-19 infection and vaccination has been launched by the Immunization Coalition in collaboration with Australian researchers.,,2021-10-25 07:47:44,"A calculator to help people understand their risk factors for COVID-19 infection and vaccination has been launched by the Immunization Coalition in collaboration with Australian researchers. The tool's three co-lead researchers are University of Queensland virologist Dr. Kirsty Short, CoRiCal instigator from Flinders University Associate Professor John Litt and GP Dr. Andrew Baird. Dr. Kirsty Short said the Immunization Coalition COVID-19 Risk Calculator (CoRiCal) was an online tool to support GPs and community members in their discussions about the benefits and risks of COVID-19 vaccines. ""This tool is really designed to help people make an informed decision around vaccination based on their current circumstances and also see their risk for getting COVID-19 under different transmission scenarios,"" Dr. Short said. ""Users can access the tool and input their age, sex, community transmission and vaccination status to find out their personalized risk calculation. ""For example, you can find out your chance of being infected with COVID-19 versus your chance of dying from the disease. ""You can also find out your chance of developing an atypical blood clot from the AstraZeneca vaccine and see this data in the context of other relatable risks—like getting struck by lightning or winning OzLotto."" The CoRiCal COVID Risk Calculator is in its pilot stage but will be continuously updated in line with the latest health and scientific advice, including risk assessments on Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, pre-existing medical conditions such as obesity and diabetes, and long COVID. The CoRiCal project included a team of GPs, medical scientists, public health physicians, epidemiologists and statisticians. Associate Professor John Litt, Immunization Coalition Scientific Advisory Committee member, said he hoped that CoRiCal would help GPs save time and create an accurate assessment of an individual's risk of COVID-19 or one of the vaccines. ""GPs are spending a lot of time trying to explain the risks of COVID-19 and the various vaccines to their patients,"" Dr. Litt said. ""An accurate, evidence-based tool that is transparent and unaligned with professional groups should help GPs in their task of facilitating COVID vaccination for their patients."" Melbourne-based GP Dr. Andrew Baird said CoRiCal was adaptable for booster doses, new viral strains, new vaccines, younger age groups, international markets and even for other infectious diseases. ""It presents risk using simple bar-charts, so that it's easy to compare the risks for different outcomes related to COVID-19 and vaccines,"" Dr. Baird said. ""CoRiCal may help Australia to move towards 90 percent, 95 percent, or even more of the 16 and over population being fully vaccinated. ""The higher the rate of vaccination in the population, the better it will be for individuals, communities, mental health, health services, and the country."" Dr. Baird said while CoRiCal had been developed for GPs and other health professionals, it was important that people could easily access this information online without a consultation.

Comedy comeback: Laughing through COVID-19 with comedian Kate Davis,https://kitchener.citynews.ca/local-news/comedy-comeback-laughing-through-covid-19-with-comedian-kate-davis-4546091,,['Taylor Pace'],,Toronto-based comic Kate Davis will be performing at The Crazy Canuck in Kitchener for Rusty Nail's comedy comeback series on Oct. 29,,2021-10-24 20:30:00,"What happens when a comedian is forced to isolate alone in a room for 21 days? Well, they get a lot of material. Veteran comedian Kate Davis found herself isolated in her room for three weeks, sick with COVID-19 after gigging in BC in March 2020. “But I got some good bits out of it. I say I was 21 days in my bedroom alone. And as a mother of three, I felt like I'd won the lottery. I didn’t have to talk to them or cook or clean,” Davis said. She didn’t have any of the symptoms the doctors told her about. “But the one symptom I had -- I didn't realize I couldn't smell anything, until my teenage son walked in the room, and I couldn't smell him. And I'm like, I’ve got COVID for sure.” Davis has been in the comedy scene since she was 29, before the internet was saturated with comedy shows, she said. “It was in my second or third year of doing comedy that the Comedy Network launched,” she said. “Before, you really had to go to a club to see it.” But she happened to live around the corner from a comedy club, and passed by it regularly. One day she went in to see a show. “And I thought, you know what, I'm gonna give this a try. I think I could do this. And I did and never looked back.” Since then, her career has taken her touring across the country and to Europe. She also does motivational speaking, teaching people how to not take themselves so seriously and incorporate humour into their lives for a “more stress-free and healthier life.” “The most precious thing for me about stand up is it's impossible to laugh and not be in the moment. And we talk about mindfulness all the time. And it's like, the perfect way to be mindful, because you can’t not be when you're laughing. It's the one thing that all humans share -- laughter, no matter what language we're all speaking. So for me, it's just bringing everyone together, being in the moment, sharing in that moment. Davis says she has a lot of new material, much of it derived from her time in isolation. She is currently working on putting out a new EP. Her last album, House Arrest, is available for streaming on all platforms. Davis will be at The Crazy Canuck Oct. 29 for Rusty Nail’s comedy comeback series, along with Vito D'Amico and Dan Brennan. Since August 2020, local entertainment company Rusty Nail has been hosting pro comedy shows every Friday and Saturday night at The Crazy Canuck. They’ve been referring to it as the comedy comeback, because “people really thought that live comedy was dead,” said owner and comedian, Alex (Sandy) MacFarlane. “There was this thought that we’re never coming back; the comedy clubs are all going to close because they won’t be able to financially make it through this time,” he said. “So we wanted to be like, nah, we’re coming back. We’re going to push through all of this.” MacFarlane first got into comedy in 2008 through what he calls a purposeful accident, when a friend encouraged him to try his hand at an amateur night contest at a Yuk Yuks in London, Ont. To his surprise, he ended up winning the competition and was invited back to open for the headliner the following weekend. Being on stage petrified him, but the release of endorphins and adrenaline that hit him after was thrilling, and he became hooked on “the attention and the immediate gratification of a live audience.” “I wasn’t quite the class clown type, but I was always striving to make people laugh, and I had always admired comedians. So I think when I took my shot at it, people were surprised, but not overly surprised,” he said. He started producing shows in 2011, and five years and hundreds of shows later, he launched Rusty Nail. “I did it for two reasons: One, it got me stage time. If I produce the show, I put myself on the show. So it helped me as a comedian that way. But I also was in a pretty serious relationship at that time. And when you're when you're a comic, and you have to travel, especially in a country like Canada. It takes you away from your friends and family quite a bit,” he said. Plus, he loved comedy. So he began producing shows in the region. “It helped that I was a comedian because I knew the right things to do and the right way to treat the comedians,” he said. Throughout the pandemic, Rusty Nail has produced over 100 shows. “I don’t think anybody else in the country could say that,” he said. “At one point, we were the only comedy show in Canada running because we had a special spot downtown Kitchener where we could be outside.” They did a few virtual shows as well between December 2020 and February 2021 when lockdowns were in effect. “Making people laugh during this time was amazing. And at the end of the show, when people are coming up to you saying, that was so funny, I haven’t laughed like that in so long, or I really needed that. It's gold.” For MacFarlane, comedy can be a tool to escape from the craziness of the world. “If it’s COVID, your job, whatever, we’re just here to laugh, forget about that,” he said. “You know, that whole cheesy line about laughter being the best medicine. I really do believe it's true.” You can stay tuned on upcoming shows on their website .",https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/kitchenertoday/images/arts/195299006_493377401965201_13947716168825012_n.jpg;w=630,kitchenertoday
"Lachine Rapids where Montreal firefighter died have a long, dangerous history",https://panow.com/2021/10/24/lachine-rapids-where-montreal-firefighter-died-have-a-long-dangerous-history/,,,,MONTREAL - The stretch of the St. Lawrence River where a Montreal firefighter died during a rescue last week has been known for centuries as one of th...,"MONTREAL — The stretch of the St. Lawrence River where a Montreal firefighter died during a rescue last week has been known for centuries as one of the city’s most treacherous. Today, the Lachine Rapids are mostly an attraction for surfers, sport kayakers and riverside picnickers, but the death of 58-year-old Pierre Lacroix is a reminder that Montreal owes its very existence to their dangerous nature. Lacroix was one of four firefighters who were on a boat that capsized last Sunday night while trying to help a couple in another boat in distress. While the others were all rescued, Lacroix died after becoming trapped under the boat. Louise Desrosiers, a spokeswoman for the Montreal fire department, said rescue boats typically avoid venturing into the fast-moving current of the rapids. “It’s a sector that’s dangerous, so boats will go upstream to save people or downstream to recuperate people who have passed through the rapids,” she said in a phone interview. Desrosiers says eight fire stations have nautical rescue units, all staffed by specially trained employees. Calls for help are initially categorized as either “engine trouble” or the more serious “maritime emergency,” which usually happens when someone is in the water or in immediate danger. While the boaters in the incident involving Lacroix had first reported an engine stall, Desrosiers said she couldn’t confirm how the call had been categorized. An investigation into his death remains ongoing. Michel Martin, a prevention officer with the Canadian Coast Guard Auxiliary, describes the rapids as “unforgiving” and “a trap.” Since he began with the service in 2014, he said he’s seen more and more boaters, paddle boarders and fishermen out on the water – some of them inexperienced or unaware when they first start getting caught in the current. He said the auxiliary coast boats, like the fire rescue, don’t venture into the rapids because the boats aren’t designed for the conditions he describes as rocky and unpredictable, with fast-moving water that varies from a third of a metre to three metres deep. “We’ll do everything to help people in distress, but not at the expense of the life of our members,” he said in a phone interview. Lacroix is far from the first person to lose his life in the dangerous waters of the rapids. For better or worse, the rushing waters have shaped the city’s existence from its earliest days, according to historian Denis Gravel. “Montreal wouldn’t be Montreal without the rapids,” said Gravel, who specializes in municipal history. While the island was long used as a meeting and fishing place for Indigenous people, it served as a roadblock for European explorers including Jacques Cartier and Samuel de Champlain, who stopped after learning their ships could not proceed further upriver. Until the Lachine Canal opened in 1825 to bypass the rapids, goods heading toward the Great Lakes had to be unloaded in the Montreal area or portaged — leading to the city developing as an area of trade and settlement. “From the beginning of European settlement, there are “many, many stories of shipwrecks and danger, of people who drowned or went fishing and didn’t pay attention,” Gravel said. One of the earliest reported incidents involved an associate of Champlain’s who headed to a nearby island along with two Indigenous men. Their boat, laden with birds, capsized on the way back, and two of the three drowned. While the rapids were nearly impassable heading west, boats would still try to run the rapids the other way. Some were rafts laden with goods and steered by specialist pilots who, despite their skill, sometimes lost their cargo to the current. Later, steamboats carried tourists looking for a thrill. In 1873 one such boat, the Louis Renaud, crashed in the rapids, reportedly avoiding tragedy thanks to the Mohawks from nearby Kahnawake who came to the passengers’ aid. There have been other incidents in more recent years. A fisherman died after losing his footing in 2010, and a surfer died after falling at a popular surfing locale dubbed the standing wave in 2013. This summer, a man disappeared after falling off a boat. The number of rescues in Montreal’s waters appears to be rising, although mishaps at the rapids have remained stable. The Montreal fire department has seen a 30 per cent increase in the overall number of nautical incidents since 2019 — something Desrosiers says could be attributable to the rising popularity of outdoor sports during the COVID-19 pandemic. Desrosiers says it’s important for boaters, especially less experienced ones, to remember the St. Lawrence’s strong currents make it challenging to navigate. She said it’s also crucial for boaters to familiarize themselves with their vessels and the places where they’re boating, to avoid drugs and alcohol and to wear a properly-fitted life-jacket.

Deal on Biden's $2T-plan edges closer,https://www.manilatimes.net/2021/10/25/news/world/deal-on-bidens-2t-plan-edges-closer/1819592,['News'],['Associated Press'],,"WASHINGTON, D:C:: A deal within reach, President Joe Biden and Congress' top Democrats edged close to sealing their giant domestic legislation, though the informal deadline appeared to slip as they worked to scale back the measure and determine how to pay for it.Negotiations were expected to continue into the weekend, all sides indicating just a few issues remained unsettled in the sweeping package of social services and climate change strategies.Biden met at the White House on Friday with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer joined by video call from New York, trying to shore up details. The leaders have been working with party moderates and progressives to shrink the once-$3.5-trillion, 10-year package to around $2 trillion in child care, health care and clean energy programs.Pelosi said a deal was ""very possible."" She told reporters back at the Capitol that more than 90 percent of the package was agreed to: The climate change components of the bill ""are resolved,"" but outstanding questions remained on health care provisions.Vice President Kamala Harris sounded even more certain. On a visit to New York City, she said tensions often rise over final details but ""I am confident, frankly — not only optimistic, but I am confident that we will reach a deal."" No agreement was announced by Friday's self-imposed deadline to at least agree on a basic outline. Biden wants a deal before he leaves next week for global summits in Europe.Pelosi hoped the House could start voting as soon as next week, but no schedule was set.Sticking points appear to include proposed corporate tax hikes to help finance the plan and an effort to lower prescription drug costs that has raised concerns from the pharmaceutical industry. Democrats are in search of a broad compromise between the party's progressives and moderates on the measure's price tag, revenue sources and basic components.At the White House, the president has ""rolled up his sleeves and is deep in the details of spreadsheets and numbers,"" press secretary Jen Psaki said.Biden was to spend the weekend at his home in Wilmington, Delaware.Psaki compared the work to starting Social Security and other major federal programs decades ago, then building on them in following years.""Progress here is a historic package that will put in place systems and programs that have never existed in our society before,"" she said, noting the effort to expand child care and provide free prekindergarten for all youngsters.Negotiations are proceeding as Biden more forcefully appeals to the American public, including in a televised town hall, for what he says are the middle-class values at the heart of his proposal.In a Senate that is evenly divided between the Democrats and firmly opposed Republicans, Biden can't afford to lose a single vote. He is navigating his own party's factions — progressives, who want major investments in social services and centrists, who prefer to see the overall price tag go down.""When you're president of the United States, you have 50 Democrats — every one is a president. Every single one. So you gotta work things out,"" he said during a CNN town hall on Thursday.Still, he expressed optimism about the process. ""It's all about compromise. Compromise has become a dirty word, but bipartisanship and compromise still has to be possible,"" he said.On one issue — the taxes to pay for the package — the White House idea seemed to be making headway with a new strategy of abandoning plans for reversing Trump-era tax cuts in favor of an approach that would involve imposing a 15-percent corporate minimum tax and also taxing the investment incomes of billionaires to help finance the deal.Biden has faced resistance from key holdouts, in particular Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, Democrat-Arizona, who has not been on board with her party's plan to undo former president Donald Trump's tax breaks for big corporations and individuals earning more than $400,000 a year.The president was unusually forthcoming Thursday night about the sticking points in the negotiations with Sinema and another Democrat, conservative Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia.While the president said Sinema opposed raising ""a single penny in taxes"" on the wealthy or corporations, a White House official later clarified that the president was referring to raising the top tax rates, not the range of tax proposals, ""which Sen[ator] Sinema supports."" If so, that could unlock a key piece of a deal. With a better understanding of the revenues available, Democrats can then develop a topline amount of spending for the package and adjust the duration and sums for various programs accordingly.Biden said Manchin doesn't want to ""rush"" the transition to clean energy so quickly it will result in major job losses in his coal-producing state.Even still, Biden acknowledged major reductions to his original vision.He signaled the final plan would no longer provide free community college, but said he hoped to increase Pell Grants to compensate for the loss of the policy.He also said that what had been envisioned as a federally paid, months-long family leave program would be just four weeks.Another work in progress — the idea of expanding Medicare to include dental, vision and hearing aid benefits for seniors, is a priority for Sen. Bernie Sanders, the independent of Vermont.Biden said he likes the idea, but with Manchin and Sinema objecting, the proposal is ""a reach."" Instead, Democrats, he said, are considering offering seniors an $800 voucher to access dental care as well as another program for hearing aids that Sinema may support. However, the vision care component, Biden said, has been harder to resolve and there is no consensus yet.Overall, Biden and his party are trying to shore up middle-class households, tackle climate change and have the most wealthy Americans and corporations pay what he calls their ""fair share"" for the nation.In the mix are at least $500 billion in clean energy tax credits and other efforts to battle climate change, $350 billion for child care subsidies and free prekindergarten, an extension of the $300-monthly child tax credit put in place during the Covid-19 crisis and money for health care provided through the Affordable Care Act.The newly proposed tax provisions, though, have rankled Democrats who have long campaigned on scrapping the Republican-backed tax cuts that many believe unduly reward the wealthy and cost the government untold sums in lost revenue at a time of gaping income inequality. Many are furious that perhaps a lone senator could stymie that goal.Under the changes being floated the 21-percent corporate rate would not change, nor would the top individual rate of 39.6 percent on those earning $400,000 or $450,000 for couples.However, the White House is reviving the idea of a corporate minimum tax rate that would hit even companies that say they had no taxable income — a frequent target of Biden, who complains they pay ""zero"" in taxes.The new tax on the wealthiest individuals would be modeled on legislation from Sen. Ron Wyden, Democrat-Oregon, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. He has proposed taxing stock gains of people with more than $1 billion in assets — fewer than 1,000 Americans.",,2021-10-24 16:03:00,,https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2021/10/24/22339.jpg,manilatimes

She further added that it will be a major step towards the path of recovery and normalcy for India and the region. Sheikh Hasina also told PM Modi that the Bangladesh government has been carrying out a mass vaccination programme with more than 60 million people being inoculated so far. Hasina reiterated that India has been an important source of Covid-19 vaccines for Bangladesh from the very beginning of the vaccination programme. The prime minister thanked the Government of India for resuming exports of the Covishield vaccine, hoping that the procurement will continue uninterrupted in the coming days.",,indiatoday

The prime minister described the European Commission’s withholding of the €36-billion grant for post-pandemic rebuilding as a “breach of the rule of law,” and said Poles would not “surrender.” In order to find a compromise, he added, the EU should reverse its recent decision to fine Warsaw daily until it implemented ECJ decisions regarding its judicial reform. “This would be the wisest thing they can do because then we are not talking to each other with a gun to our head.

The deadline for all health-care workers in the province to be fully vaccinated is Tuesday. Horgan says the majority of health-care workers are immunized and often perplexed about why others wouldn't follow the science behind vaccination and the advice of provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry. The vaccine mandate will apply to everyone who works in health-care settings, including students, doctors, contractors and volunteers. Those who don't have their first dose by the deadline can't work unless they have a recognized medical exemption. Workers who get their first shot before Nov. 15 can resume working seven days after the first dose, but they must wear personal protective equipment and take other precautions until they have their second dose, which must be no more than 35 days after the initial dose. Staff at long-term care homes and assisted living facilities needed to be fully vaccinated by Oct. 12. British Columbia is reporting 1,618 new cases of COVID-19, 20 deaths and five new health-care facility outbreaks over the last three days. It says in a news release that 84.4 per cent of eligible people aged 12 and up are now fully vaccinated. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Oct. 25, 2021.

River View School to go virtual for at least 10 days beginning Monday due to COVID cases,https://www.sootoday.com/local-news/river-view-school-to-go-virtual-for-at-least-10-days-beginning-monday-due-to-covid-cases-4546133,,['SooToday Staff'],,"‘Not a school closure, but a precautionary measure’ Algoma District School Board states",,2021-10-24 20:26:26,"Effective Monday, Oct. 25, all classes at River View Public School will move to virtual learning for at least 10 days. That from an email received from the Algoma District School Board (ADSB). The ADSB has been working closely with Algoma Public Health (APH) to support several contact tracing investigations after positive COVID-19 tests were linked to individuals connected to River View Public School. APH declared a facility-wide COVID-19 outbreak at River View Thursday. The ADSB says there are six confirmed cases of COVID-19 among individuals associated with River View Public School. “Given the current number of cases, the high absenteeism rate (opting for virtual) and the number of classes already pivoted to hybrid, effective Monday, October 25th, all classes at River View P.S. will move to virtual for at least ten days. Please note that this decision is precautionary and intended to support the best scenario of staffing and supervision, while reducing the potential for additional asymptomatic spread. ADSB will be communicating with families closer to the proposed return date, to confirm when their child’s class is able to revert back to in-person learning,” the ADSB wrote. “This is not a school closure,” the board emphasized. “The move to remote/virtual learning is a precautionary measure made by the school board, not one that was ordered by the Health Unit.” “We regret any inconvenience this may cause, however, we do feel this precautionary decision is in the best interest of student and staff safety,” the ADSB wrote.",https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/sootoday/images/stock-images/20200526-adsb-summer-stock-dt-03.jpg;w=630,sootoday

"COVID cases falling, but trouble signs arise as winter looms",https://www.burnabynow.com/coronavirus-covid-19-national-news/covid-cases-falling-but-trouble-signs-arise-as-winter-looms-4549180,,,,Tumbling COVID-19 case counts have some schools around the U.S.,,2021-10-25 19:32:26,"Tumbling COVID-19 case counts have some schools around the U.S. considering relaxing their mask rules, but deaths nationally have been ticking up over the past few weeks, some rural hospitals are showing signs of strain, and cold weather is setting in. The number of new cases nationally has been plummeting since the delta surge peaked in mid-September. The U.S. is averaging about 73,000 new cases per day, less than half of the nearly 173,000 recorded on Sept. 13. And the number of Americans in the hospital with COVID-19 has plummeted by about half to around 47,000 since early September. In Florida, Miami-Dade County's mask mandate could be loosened by the end of October if the encouraging numbers continue. A high school outside Boston became the first in Massachusetts to make masks optional after it hit a state vaccination threshold. With about 95% of eligible people at Hopkinton High inoculated, school leaders voted to allow vaccinated students and staff to go maskless for a three-week trial period starting Nov. 1. Still, there are some troubling indicators, including the onset of cold weather, which sends people indoors, where the virus can more easily spread. With required mask use reduced in much of the U.S., the University of Washington's influential COVID-19 forecasting model is predicting increasing infections and hospitalizations in November. Also, COVID-19 deaths per day have begun to creep back up again after a decline that started in late September. Deaths are running at about 1,700 per day, up from close to 1,500 two weeks ago. In sparsely populated Wyoming, which has one of the nation’s lowest vaccination rates , hospitals are coping with more patients than at any other point in the pandemic. “It’s like a war zone,” public health officer Dr. Mark Dowell told a county health board about the situation at Wyoming Medical Center, the Casper Star Tribune reported. “The ICU is overrun.” The vast majority of hospitalized patients in Wyoming haven't gotten the vaccine, the state's vaccination rate is only about 43%. Only West Virginia ranks lower. In rural Minnesota, a man waited two days for an intensive care bed and later died. Bob Cameron, 87, had gone to to his hometown hospital in Hallock with severe gastrointestinal bleeding and COVID-19. Officials searched for space in a larger center. The bleeding exhausted the hospital’s blood supply, and state troopers drove 130 miles (209 kilometers) with new units, but his condition worsened after surgery and he died Oct. 13, t he Minneapolis Star Tribune reported . “We can’t say for certain, of course, that if he got to an ICU bed sooner that he would have survived, but we just feel in our hearts that he would have,” said Cameron’s granddaughter, Janna Curry. During a three-week stretch this month, rural hospitals in Minnesota were caring for more COVID-19 patients than those in the state’s major urban center, Minneapolis-St. Paul. The strain on hospitals in Colorado forced a second county to reinstitute an indoor mask mandate last week, the Denver Post reported . Nearly 80% of COVID-19 patients in Colorado hospitals are unvaccinated.

There are some health rules still in place: everyone must be double vaccinated and everyone must be masked indoors.

Booster shots for health workers could be justified as ‘policy decision’,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/booster-shots-for-health-workers-could-be-justified-as-policy-decision-1.4709649?localLinksEnabled=false,,,,"The Government could keep the hospitals safer this winter by giving healthcare workers a booster Covid-19 vaccine but it is not required from a scientific basis, a leading virologist has said. Dr Cillian De Gascun, a member of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac), said vaccines had adequately protected health workers from illness but the Government could decide to boost immunity to avoid the hospital system coming under further pressure during the winter. He noted that health workers were mostly young and still had effective protection from the vaccine but he pointed to recent scientific evidence showing declining vaccine effectiveness after six months and that health workers had been vaccinated in the early part of the year. “The evidence isn’t there scientifically to justify boosting what is otherwise a fairly young healthy cohort – frontline healthcare workers,” said Dr De Gascun. “But, as a policy decision, if you know that vaccine effectiveness is falling off, I don’t think it would be unreasonable for the HSE or the Government or the Department [of Health] to decide that actually we can’t have a risk of the healthcare system coming under massive pressure.” Hospital outbreaks where patients were getting infected by staff or staff are being forced out of work could put significant pressure on the hospital system over winter. “You could make a justifiable policy-based decision that in order to maintain or protect the healthcare system over the course of the winter that it would be prudent to vaccinate frontline healthcare workers,” he said. The director of UCD’s National Virus Reference Laboratory, a member of the National Public Health Emergency Team, stressed that he was speaking in a personal capacity and not on behalf of Niac, which is still considering whether to extend boosters to health staff. The HSE has been providing third booster jabs to people aged over 80 in the community and individuals aged 65 and over in care homes and other long-term residential care facilities. It is also extending the booster programme to 800,000 people aged between 60 and 80 and people who have compromised immune systems. Niac is coming under pressure to extend the rollout to health workers as HSE chief executive Paul Reid warned that the number of health workers out sick could soon rise to 2,000. The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation has written to the State’s chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan and the chair of Niac calling on boosters to be given to frontline health workers. The representative group pointed to the increase in Covid-19 infections among healthcare workers with nurses and midwives the most infected, accounting for more than 26 per cent of all health worker infections. A total of 371 nurses and midwives have been infected in the past month. Meanwhile, the representative group for the private nursing home operators says providing booster vaccinations for nursing home staff was “beyond critical” and must be planned as soon as possible. “We are seeing high numbers again,” said Tadhg Daly, chief executive of Nursing Homes Ireland. “There are outbreaks in hospitals, outbreaks in nursing homes. Hopefully, the decision will be made as soon as possible, in the next 24 hours, and once the decision is made, we then need a programme.” There were 1,725 new cases of Covid-19 reported in the State on Sunday with 473 people in hospital with the virus, including 97 in intensive care units – an increase of 23 in a week. Dr De Gascun said that, as cases increasing across all ages, the focus was on trying to get younger people vaccinated to the same high levels as in older ages and to administer third doses to older people as quickly as possible given that they were at greatest risk of hospitalisation. “The force of infection in the community is so high that it is pushing into the vaccinated population as well,” he said.",,2021-10-25 03:00:00,"The Government could keep the hospitals safer this winter by giving healthcare workers a booster Covid-19 vaccine but it is not required from a scientific basis, a leading virologist has said.

Ngayon nakita natin we were able to defeat Delta (Now, we have seen that we were able to defeat Delta),"" Galvez had said.Vergeire believes Galvez made the statement in the context of earlier projections that the country may mirror the experiences of India and Indonesia, where a surge of Delta cases affected their overall response.""We were expecting talaga na magkakaroon ng sobrang taas na kaso, tayo ay ma-o-overwhelm, marami ang mamamatay, pero hindi po natin naabot 'yung projected number of cases at 'yung overwhelmed [na] health system (We were expecting high cases, that we may get overwhelmed and many will die, but we never reached the projected number),"" she said.She added that while the country' health system was challenged because of the Delta surge, prompt actions by the government led to a reduction of cases one and a half months after the variant was first detected.""Hindi po natin sinasabi na 'natalo' na natin ang Delta, ang Delta po, nandito pa sa atin... pero ang pinakamaganda, we were able to control and reduce the number of cases and naisaayos natin ang (We never said that we 'defeated' Delta, as Delta remained here in the country, but what is good is that we were able to control and reduce the number of cases and we have fixed our) health system capacity,"" Vergeire said.The Philippines has a low-risk classification of Covid-19 with a two-week growth rate of -48 percent and an average daily attack rate of nearly 5.9 cases per 100,000 population.The National Capital Region is under moderate risk with a -53-percent decrease in the two-week growth rate and ADAR of 8.56 cases per 100,000 population.On Monday, the country reported 4,405 new Covid-19 cases for a total of 2.761 million cases.",,2021-10-25 17:00:36,,https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2021/10/26/22598.jpg,manilatimes

KUCHING, Oct 26 ― A Parti Sarawak Bersatu (PSB) man has called upon the state government to provide all low-income households in rural Sarawak with free Covid-19 self-test kits.In pointing this out, PSB Mulu pro tem chairman Prof Son Radu believed that there were signs of a surge in new Covid-19 cases and deaths.“Deaths from Covid-19 have remained high, in the double digits range. Equally alarming is the number of brought-in-dead (BID) cases.“There are now field hospitals, which are typically associated with war zones, in Miri, Sibu and Kuching. The one in Kuching is sponsored by Mercy Malaysia.“Sarawak’s intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacity has hit the 80 per cent occupied level. The seldom-told part of this is the ICU beds are cramped in a very limited space.“Indeed, these are not signs that anybody should be comfortable with. My fear is that Sarawak might not be able to enter into the endemic stage at any time soon, as Malaysia is expected to enter Phase 4 (of the National Recovery Plan) by next month – the stage some are referring to as the endemic stage,” said Son, who is also PSB’s potential state election candidate for Mulu.He said it did not help when Minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Dato Sri Alexander Nanta Linggi had said recently that the state’s ruling coalition, Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS), wanted to hold the 12th state election ‘before the Covid-19 vaccines’ effectiveness waned’.“In view of these things and to ensure that Sarawakians, particularly the rural-based Sarawakians, are able to both actively and effectively practise ‘intelligent living’, I urge the Sarawak government to, on the most urgent basis, provide all those in the B40 (low-income) and the lower rung of the M40 (medium-income) households with Covid-19 self-test kits.“The number of kits provided should be enough for all members of each household to administer self-test every fortnightly, until two weeks after the 12th state election is held, at the very least,” said the PSB man.Son said the endemic stage, once officially declared, would be the stage where the government had acknowledged that ‘the Covid-19 is here to stay’.In the meantime, he also appealed to the GPS-led government to not hold the next state election before the lifting of the Emergency scheduled in February next year.“Use the remaining three months to manage this pandemic well so that the 12th state election could be safely held either in February or March next year,” he added. ― Borneo Post",2021-10-26 02:10:38,,,malaymail

"Parents more hesitant to vaccinate kids than themselves, researcher says",https://www.richmond-news.com/national-news/parents-more-hesitant-to-vaccinate-kids-than-themselves-researcher-says-4545466,,['Canadian Press'],,"OTTAWA — Jennifer Hubert jumped at the opportunity to get her COVID-19 vaccine, but she’s not looking forward to having to make the decision about whether to vaccinate her three-year-old son Jackson.",,2021-10-24 11:00:00,"OTTAWA — Jennifer Hubert jumped at the opportunity to get her COVID-19 vaccine, but she’s not looking forward to having to make the decision about whether to vaccinate her three-year-old son Jackson. She recognizes the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, but said she also understands her son is at a much lower risk for serious illness than older adults. “To me it's not a clear benefit,” she said. While many parents were overjoyed at the news that Health Canada is considering approval of the first COVID-19 vaccine for kids age five to 11 in Canada, parents like Hubert are feeling more trepidatious, and public health officials said they are going to have a much more nuanced conversation with parents about vaccination than they did with adults. While 82 per cent of eligible Canadians aged 12 and up are already fully vaccinated, a recent survey by Angus Reid shows only 51 per cent of parents plan to immediately vaccinate their kids when a pediatric dose becomes available. Of parents with children in the five to 11 year age range, 23 per cent said they would never give their kids a COVID-19 vaccine, 18 per cent said they would wait, and nine per cent said they weren’t sure, according to the survey of 5,011 Canadians between Sept. 29 and Oct. 3, which cannot be assigned a margin of error because online surveys are not considered random samples. “Most of the research that I've seen sort of indicates that parents are more hesitant to vaccinate their kids against COVID than themselves,” said Kate Allen, a post-doctoral fellow at the Center for Vaccine Preventable Diseases of the University of Toronto. There are several reasons parents might pause, she said. It’s true that children are at a much lower risk of serious outcomes associated with COVID-19, and there have been very rare incidents of mRNA vaccines like Pfizer or Moderna linked to cases of myocarditis, a swelling of the heart muscle. As of Oct. 1, Health Canada has documented 859 cases associated with the vaccines, which mainly seem to affect people under 40 years old, and people who’ve developed the complication have typically been fine. “I know it's rare, I know it's not deadly, but I also see the risk of severe symptoms from COVID as being rare and not deadly for Jackson,” Hubert said when asked about weighing up the risks and benefits of the vaccine. But public health experts stress that some children do suffer from rare but serious impacts from COVID-19, which can also cause myocarditis as well as the little-understood impacts of the condition known as long COVID. They say parents should consider the less tangible benefits of vaccination as well. “It's less of a conversation about a direct benefit to them, and more of a community benefit,” Allen said. The pandemic has taken a heavy toll on children, depriving them of school, time with their peers, extracurriculars — and their mental health has suffered as a result, said Dr. Vinita Dubey, associate medical officer of health with Toronto Public Health. “Not one child has been spared from this pandemic. I mean every single child has had to bear a sacrifice because of the pandemic in one way or the other,” Dubey said. So far Pfizer-BioNtech is the only manufacturer to request approval for its pediatric COVID-19 vaccine and Health Canada is still reviewing the data. The regulator has promised the review will be thorough, and the vaccine will only be approved for children if the benefits outweigh the potential risks. Policy-makers know they’re going to have to take parents' concerns seriously as well. On a recent tour of the Childrens’ Hospital of Eastern Ontario in Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with Dr. Anne Pham-Huy, a pediatric infectious diseases physician. “Vaccine confidence is going to be the most important part of it this time around,” Pham-Huy said, to which Trudeau agreed. Dubey has published research on improving parents’ vaccine confidence when it comes to long-established inoculations like mumps and rubella. While she offered several tips, they mainly come down to building trust. Her research focused on the role of family doctors, but she said during the pandemic anyone can be that trusted sounding board. “It could be a faith leader, it could be an important family member or friend, someone who you trust, to help guide you to the right sources to make that decision,” she said. With that in mind, several students from across North America launched a peer-to-peer education program called Students for Herd Immunity to allow kids to have those conversations among themselves. The public health experts agree, the debate around vaccines has become polarized and open conversations will be the key to addressing parents' concerns. “I think one thing to say to parents is you don't have to make your decision right away,” Dubey said. “I mean for those who are ready to make their decision, but it's fine but if you have questions, seek the answers.” Her only advice is to get those answers from a trusted source, and not social media.

The lesson for investors is clear: steer clear of this troubled company. Another bad quarter Three months ago, many airlines expected to be profitable during the third quarter, thanks to a strong rebound in summer leisure travel. However, despite the improving demand environment, American Airlines never expected to turn a profit in Q3, mainly due to its high cost structure and crippling interest costs. Management's initial guidance called for American to log an adjusted pre-tax margin between -3% and -7%, with revenue down 20% from the third quarter of 2019. Adding to the airline's woes, demand stalled out near the beginning of August as U.S. COVID-19 case numbers surged. In early September, American Airlines slashed its quarterly forecast, saying that it expected revenue to fall 24% to 28% from Q3 2019, leading to an adjusted pre-tax margin between -10% and -14%. Ultimately, American's third-quarter revenue totaled $9 billion, down 25% from two years ago. The company recorded an adjusted pre-tax loss of $833 million, putting its adjusted pre-tax margin at -9.3%: better than its most recent forecast but still considerably worse than its initial quarterly guidance. (American did earn a $169 million profit under generally accepted accounting principles , but that included a substantial benefit from the final batch of federal payroll support grants.) Image source: American Airlines. To put American's results in context, key rival Delta Air Lines ( NYSE:DAL ) reported a modest Q3 adjusted profit earlier this month. Meanwhile, United Airlines ( NASDAQ:UAL ) posted a smaller adjusted pre-tax loss of $473 million, which translated to a -6.1% adjusted pre-tax margin . The fourth quarter will be worse American Airlines' financial results will likely deteriorate further in the fourth quarter, which tends to be a seasonally weaker period for airlines. On Thursday, the company said that it expects revenue to fall 20% compared to Q4 2019 on 11% to 13% less capacity. Adding to the earnings pressure, nonfuel unit costs are on pace to rise 8% to 10% over that period and fuel prices could spike by roughly 20% compared to the $2.05 per gallon that American paid two years ago. Based on these projections, management expects American Airlines to report an awful -16% to -18% adjusted pre-tax margin this quarter. That implies a pre-tax loss of roughly $1.5 billion. Unless American beats these targets by a country mile, its Q4 financial results will lag those of Delta and United again. United Airlines' guidance implies an adjusted pre-tax loss of around $1 billion this quarter, and Delta Air Lines in turn will post a much smaller loss than United. Massive risk and little upside Analysts currently expect most U.S. airlines to earn substantial profits next year (assuming no additional pandemic-related setbacks). By contrast, the analyst consensus currently calls for American Airlines to earn a negligible profit in 2022. Image source: American Airlines. American Airlines' weak balance sheet makes its persistently weak profitability particularly dangerous. American ended last quarter with $38.3 billion of debt, plus around $15 billion of pension and lease liabilities. Moreover, the airline used over $1.7 billion of cash in its operations last quarter. Based on its weak Q4 earnings forecast, it will likely burn even more cash this quarter. To be fair, American ended last quarter with $14.5 billion of unrestricted cash and investments, giving it time to turn things around. However, the company has nearly $20 billion of debt maturing between now and the end of 2025. If American Airlines still isn't generating meaningful earnings and cash flow within a couple of years, it could struggle to repay or refinance all that debt. That creates substantial risk for investors. On the flip side, American Airlines' fully diluted market cap has rebounded beyond its January 2020 (i.e., pre-pandemic) level. Thus, investors aren't getting a discount for bearing this risk, making American Airlines stock extremely unattractive.",,fool

Millions of ‘filthy’ used medical gloves reportedly imported into US,https://nypost.com/2021/10/25/filthy-bloodstained-used-medical-gloves-imported-into-us/,,['Sam Raskin'],,"Millions of filthy, used medical gloves -- some even obviously bloodstained -- were imported into the US from Thailand amid a shortage of personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Millions of filthy, used medical gloves -- some even obviously bloodstained -- were imported into the US from Thailand amid a shortage of personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic.",2021-10-25 18:49:06,"Millions of filthy, used medical gloves — some even obviously bloodstained — were imported into the US from Thailand amid a shortage of personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a disturbing report. A months-long investigation by CNN found that the soiled, second-hand nitrile gloves were shipped to desperate US distributors after import regulations were suspended at the start of the pandemic to address surging demand. “There was just no other answer. There was no way to meet the demand,” industry expert Douglas Stein said told CNN. “But that opened the floodgates for all the nefarious behavior.” Stein described the medical-grade nitrile gloves as the “most dangerous commodity on Earth right now.” “There’s an enormous amount of bad product coming in. An endless stream of filthy, second-hand and substandard gloves coming into the US of which federal authorities, it seems, are only now beginning to understand the enormous scale,” he said. A criminal investigation surrounding the operation is now underway by authorities in Thailand and America. Miami businessman Tarek Kirschen was one of the US distributors who unwittingly ordered the unsanitary gloves. Kirschen told CNN he ordered about $2 million worth of gloves from Thai-based company Paddy the Room late last year. “We start getting phone calls from clients completely upset, and you know, yelling and screaming at us saying, ‘Hey, you screwed us,’” he told the outlet. “These were reused gloves. They were washed, recycled,” he said. “Some of them were dirty. Some of them had bloodstains. Some of them had markers on them with dates from two years ago … I couldn’t believe my eyes.” Kirschen said he tossed the gloves, refunded the money to his customers, and alerted the FDA in February 2021. He stressed none of the second-hand protective gloves he ordered were used in medical settings. However, the CNN investigation found that American distributors bought around 200 million gloves from Paddy the Room. It’s unclear what happened to those gloves after they entered the country. US Customs and Border Protection told CNN it had seized about 40 million counterfeit face masks and hundreds of thousands of other PPE items — but the agency says it does not count the specific amount of glove seizures. Meanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security began “Operation Stolen Promise” with the aim of stopping the flow of illicit PPE into the US. DHS Investigations Special Operations Agent Mike Rose told CNN the agency had made 2,000 seizures of supposed COVID-19-related treatments and PPE. “I think DHS has been a model around the world for how best to coordinate efforts among different agencies to really stop the import, the transactions and all the other surrounding criminal activity around COVID,” Rose insisted to the outlet.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Medicalgloves.jpg?quality=90&strip=all,nypost

Programs like the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS), the Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy (CERS) and the Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB) are set to be replaced with new measures in their place.

Story continues below advertisement “There’s no way we could have covered the rent, we would have went into a massive debt,” said Saiyan, who made use of the CRB for himself and other government programs for his business. Dance studios, much like gyms and exercise spaces, were widely considered “grey areas” in what provincial governments decided to shut down during their pandemic-induced lockdowns. While Ontario’s provincial government continues its gradual re-opening of the economy, including most recently an announcement of full capacity for gyms and restaurants set for this Monday, Saiyan said business is still just a fraction of what it was prior to the pandemic. 4:38 Pandemic rent and wage subsidies coming to an end Pandemic rent and wage subsidies coming to an end Saiyan says the business is now just operating on little more than 30 per cent of the revenue it was earning pre-COVID, and that every “penny” and more that they’ve saved up in previous years has already gone forward to cover bills like rent, electricity and wages. Story continues below advertisement “So it is scary, extremely scary, and we wholeheartedly depend on this to recover,” said Saiyan. “And I’m hoping that in January, February, things will get better and we start to go to some kind of normal.” In an announcement Thursday, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland said that new programs would be put in place to replace the pandemic measures. The new Tourism and Hospitality Recovery Program and Hardest Hit Business Recovery Program are set to come into effect Sunday, according to Freeland.

The CRB, which was formerly known as the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), will also be replaced by a more targeted program called the Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit (CWLB). While the new programs are said to be more targeted to those that need them the most, many are concerned that it won’t be enough to keep them and their businesses afloat. David Macdonald, a senior economist for the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, wrote that as many 1.5 million people could be directly impacted by the replacement of those programs — most of whom won’t have another source of income or support. Story continues below advertisement 2:18 Uncertainty as Ottawa ends wage and rent subsidies Uncertainty as Ottawa ends wage and rent subsidies Of that number, about 900,000 workers would lose support from the CRB’s eligibility and income cut, while over 640,000 workers could see their jobs in jeopardy over the CERS and CEWS cuts. “The real elephant in the room is CRB support for self-employed workers,” said Macdonald. “While several of the other programs have seen significant decline in take-up recently, the CRB has not.” Those interested in the CRB’s replacement, the CWLB, would only be eligible for it once a province or city imposes a COVID-19 lockdown, Macdonald wrote. “At this point, there doesn’t seem to be any place in Canada under lockdown and so there would be no one eligible for the CWLB at the time of writing.” Read more: Don’t stop federal COVID-19 benefits, businesses say as expiration nears Story continues below advertisement There are currently no provinces or cities in lockdown, but Freeland defended the new measures — adding that temporary local lockdowns were “still a possibility” in the months to come. “Our emergency support measures were always designed to be temporary to get us through the crisis,” she said. “We’re now in a new phase, one that is very different from the darkest days in our fight against COVID. We have recovered lost jobs.” Small business owners have previously called on the federal government to not stop COVID-19 benefits ahead of their expiration — calling it a lifeline for their livelihoods. Rina Camarra, the manager of Mastro’s Restaurant in Toronto, told Global News in September that her business was on the wage subsidy program over the months-long pandemic. 5:33 Looming expiry of pandemic financial supports leaves small businesses wary Looming expiry of pandemic financial supports leaves small businesses wary “It’s not an easy task for us to run a business nowadays,” said Camarra.

(OTCQB: CYDY) (""CytoDyn"" or the ""Company""), a late-stage biotechnology company developing leronlimab, a CCR5 antagonist with the potential for multiple therapeutic indications, announced today the treatment of the first patient in its pivotal Phase 3 trial (CD16) in Brazil for critically ill COVID-19 patients. An interim analysis will be conducted 28 days following the enrollment of 127 patients. On September 9, 2021, the Company announced the treatment of the first patient in its other pivotal Phase 3 trial in Brazil (CD17). An interim analysis for this trial will be conducted 28 days after 245 patients have been enrolled. This new pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial (CD16) will focus on hospitalized critically ill COVID-19 patients who require mechanical and invasive ventilation or Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). Leronlimab is administered via intravenous therapy (IV) in four doses or 700 mg per week. The trial is being conducted across 29 research centers (hospitals) with 316 patients. The table below summarizes results CytoDyn received from its CD12 clinical trial, and the related dosing compared to the dosing of CD-16 (critical COVID-19): Dose Injection Day CD12 - Survival Benefit vs Placebo CD12 - Subcutaneous (SQ) Dose CD16 - Intravenous (IV) Dose 1 st Day 7 +78 % SQ – 700 mg IV – 700 mg 2 nd Day 14 +82 % SQ – 700 mg IV – 700 mg 3 rd Day 21 +50 % None IV – 700 mg 4 th Day 28 +31 % None IV – 700 mg Nader Pourhassan, Ph.D., CytoDyn’s President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “The CytoDyn team, along with BIOMM and ARO, have worked diligently to initiate two pivotal Phase 3 trials in Brazil, and we are excited about the trials’ potential results. We are seeing strong optimism from all of the doctors and individuals involved in this project, especially since the primary endpoint for CD16 is similar to an endpoint in our past CD12 trial, which produced 166% better results in the leronlimab arm versus placebo. Importantly, this trial provides for two additional doses and delivery via IV (which allows leronlimab absorption to occur within 1-2 hours of being administered compared to 2-3 days when administered via SQ). We continue to be very impressed by the execution and professionalism of our partners in Brazil and, accordingly, anticipate a relatively rapid rate of enrollment if the patients are available, including the scheduled interim analyses for both Phase 3 trials. We are hopeful to be in a position to make leronlimab available for patients with severe or critical symptoms in the coming months.” About Leronlimab The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted CytoDyn Fast Track designation to explore two potential indications using leronlimab to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and metastatic cancer. The first indication is combination therapy with HAART for HIV-infected patients, and the second is for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC). Leronlimab is an investigational humanized IgG4 mAb that binds to CCR5, a cellular receptor important in HIV infection, tumor metastases, and other diseases, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Leronlimab has been studied in 16 clinical trials involving more than 1,200 people and met its primary endpoints in a pivotal Phase 3 trial (leronlimab combined with HIV standard care in patients with multi-drug resistance to current available classes of HIV drugs). Leronlimab, among various potential applications, is a viral-entry inhibitor in HIV/AIDS. It binds to CCR5, thus protecting healthy T cells from viral infection by blocking the predominant HIV (R5) subtype from entering those cells. Leronlimab does not work on other strains of HIV (for example X4), however, R5 is the most dominant strain of HIV. Five clinical trials have demonstrated leronlimab could significantly reduce or control HIV viral load in humans. The leronlimab antibody appears to be a powerful antiviral agent with fewer side effects and less frequent dosing requirements than currently used daily drug therapies. Cancer research has shown CCR5 may play a role in tumor invasion, metastases, and tumor microenvironment control (for example, through angiogenesis). Published studies have shown that blocking CCR5 can reduce tumor metastases in laboratory and animal models of aggressive breast and prostate cancer. Leronlimab reduced human breast cancer metastasis by more than 97% in a murine xenograft model. As a result, CytoDyn is conducting two clinical trials, one, a Phase 2 in mTNBC, which was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA in 2019, and a second, a Phase 2, basket trial which encompasses 22 different solid tumor cancers. The CCR5 receptor plays a central role in modulating immune cell trafficking to sites of inflammation. After completing two clinical trials with COVID-19 patients (a Phase 2 and a Phase 3), CytoDyn initiated a Phase 2 investigative trial for post-acute sequelae of SARS COV-2 (PASC), also known as COVID-19 Long-Haulers. This trial evaluated the effect of leronlimab on clinical symptoms and laboratory biomarkers to further understand the pathophysiology of PASC. It is currently estimated that between 10-30% of those infected with COVID-19 develop long-term sequelae. Common symptoms include fatigue, cognitive impairment, sleep disorders, and shortness of breath. CytoDyn plans to pursue clinical trials to evaluate leronlimab’s effect on immunological dysregulation in other post-viral syndromes, including myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). CytoDyn is also conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial for NASH to evaluate the effect of leronlimab on liver steatosis and fibrosis. Pre-clinical studies revealed a significant reduction in NAFLD and a reduction in liver fibrosis using leronlimab. There are currently no FDA approved treatments for NASH, which is a leading cause of liver transplant. About 30 to 40 percent of adults in the U.S. live with NAFLD, and 3 to 12 percent of adults in the U.S. live with NASH. There have been no strong safety signals identified in patients administered leronlimab in multiple disease spectrums, including patients with HIV, COVID-19, and oncology. About CytoDyn CytoDyn is a late-stage biotechnology company developing innovative treatments for multiple therapeutic indications using leronlimab, a novel humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the CCR5 receptor. CCR5 plays a critical role in the ability of HIV to enter and infect healthy T-cells and appears to be implicated in tumor metastasis and immune-mediated illnesses, such as NASH. CytoDyn successfully completed a Phase 3 pivotal trial using leronlimab combined with standard antiretroviral therapies in HIV-infected patients who were heavily treatment-experienced individuals with limited treatment options. CytoDyn is working diligently to resubmit its Biologics License Application (""BLA"") for this HIV combination therapy since receiving a Refusal to File in July 2020. In July 2021, CytoDyn announced that it had submitted a dose justification report to the FDA, an integral step in the resubmission process for its BLA, which it expects to complete during the first calendar quarter of 2022. CytoDyn also completed a Phase 2b/3 investigative trial with leronlimab used as a once-weekly monotherapy for HIV-infected patients. CytoDyn plans to initiate a registration-directed study of leronlimab monotherapy indication. If successful, it could support a label expansion approval. Clinical results to date from two trials have shown that leronlimab can maintain a suppressed viral load in a sub-population of R5 HIV patients who chose to switch from their daily pills regimen to once-a-week subcutaneous dose of leronlimab. Several patients on leronlimab’s Phase 2b extension arm have remained virally suppressed for almost 7 years and many patients in our Phase 2b/3 investigative trial are passing two and some four years of monotherapy with suppressed viral load. CytoDyn is also conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial with leronlimab in mTNBC, a Phase 2 basket trial in solid tumor cancers (22 different cancer indications), Phase 2 investigative trial for post-acute sequelae of SARS COV-2, also known as COVID-19 long haulers, and a Phase 2 clinical trial for NASH. CytoDyn has already completed a Phase 2 and Phase 3 trial for mild-to-moderate and severe-to-critical COVID-19 patients, respectively, for which CytoDyn did not meet its primary or secondary endpoints except for the secondary endpoint in the critically ill subpopulation.

"Covid cases falling, but trouble signs arise as winter looms in US",https://www.indiatoday.in/coronavirus-outbreak/story/covid-cases-falling-but-trouble-signs-arise-in-us-1869379-2021-10-26?utm_source=rss,,,,"Covid cases falling, but trouble signs arise as winter looms in US",,2021-10-26 03:41:48,"Tumbling Covid-19 case counts have some schools around the US considering relaxing their mask rules, but deaths nationally have been ticking up over the past few weeks, some rural hospitals are showing signs of strain, and cold weather is setting in. The number of new cases nationally has been plummeting since the delta surge peaked in mid-September. The US is averaging about 73,000 new cases per day, dramatically lower than the 173,000 recorded on September 13. And the number of Americans in the hospital with Covid-19 has plummeted by about half to around 47,000 since early September. In Florida, Miami-Dade County's mask mandate could be loosened by the end of October if the encouraging numbers continue, and nearby Broward County will discuss relaxing its requirement on Tuesday. The superintendent in metro Atlanta said he will consider waiving mask requirements at individual schools. A high school outside Boston became the first in Massachusetts to make masks optional after it hit a state vaccination threshold. With about 95% of eligible people at Hopkinton High inoculated, school leaders voted to allow vaccinated students and staff to go maskless for a three-week trial period starting November 1. Still, there are some troubling indicators, including the onset of cold weather, which sends people indoors, where the virus can more easily spread. With required mask use reduced in much of the US, the University of Washington's influential Covid-19 forecasting model is predicting increasing infections and hospitalizations in November. Also, Covid-19 deaths per day have begun to creep back up again after a decline that started in late September. Deaths are running at about 1,700 per day, up from close to 1,500 two weeks ago. The virus is still striking unvaccinated communities, many of them rural areas in states including North Dakota, Wyoming, Alaska and Minnesota. More than 67% of the nation's eligible population is fully vaccinated, and the Biden administration is getting closer to enacting a workplace vaccine mandate for every business in the country with more than 100 employees. In Alaska, which has ranked at or near the top in per-capita case rates over the last month, hospitals remain strained, but health care workers are not speaking out the way they had, said Jared Kosin, president and CEO of the Alaska State Hospital and Nursing Home Association. A recent debate over masks in Alaska's largest city, Anchorage, grew heated, and hospital and public health officials last month reported hostilities toward health care workers related to Covid-19. It's not yet clear, he said, if the state has peaked in terms of cases in this latest surge. ""It's not letting up and I think that's the hardest part with this. It's not like you can see hope on the horizon, you know we're going to see a rapid decline and get through it. it just seems to come and go and when it comes it hits really hard."" In sparsely populated Wyoming, which has one of the nation's lowest vaccination rates, hospitals are coping with more patients than at any other point in the pandemic. The vast majority of hospitalized patients in Wyoming haven't gotten the vaccine, the state's vaccination rate is only about 43%. Only West Virginia ranks lower. ""It's like a war zone,"" public health officer Dr. Mark Dowell told a county health board about the situation at Wyoming Medical Center, the Casper Star Tribune reported. ""The ICU is overrun."" In smaller hospitals in North Dakota, many people are getting long-delayed treatments for other ailments, but combined with Covid patients, facilities are pushed to the limit, said Dan Olson, executive director of a network that includes many of those facilities. ""You can talk in the morning and they have beds and by afternoon they might be at capacity,"" Olson said. In rural Minnesota, a man waited two days for an intensive care bed and later died. Bob Cameron, 87, had gone to his hometown hospital in Hallock with severe gastrointestinal bleeding and Covid-19. Officials searched for space in a larger centre. The bleeding exhausted the hospital's blood supply, and state troopers drove 130 miles (209 kilometres) with new units, but his condition worsened after surgery and he died October 13, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported. ""We can't say for certain, of course, that if he got to an ICU bed sooner than he would have survived, but we just feel in our hearts that he would have,"" said Cameron's granddaughter, Janna Curry. During a three-week stretch this month, rural hospitals in Minnesota were caring for more Covid-19 patients than those in the state's major urban centre, Minneapolis-St. Paul.",,indiatoday

It could also summarize the state of Big Oil and the traditional energy sector in this post-covid, new ESG-focused era. “Put simply, the Covid-19 pandemic has created the biggest shock to the global energy system since at least World War II,” David Turk , then-Deputy Director of the International Energy Agency (IEA) told the Senate Energy and Commerce Committee on June 16, 2020. Turk is now Deputy Secretary of Energy. It also forced the much-needed transformation, according to Deloitte’s head of the Energy, Resources and Industrials practice, Kathryn Pavlovsky. She told me on my Electric Ladies podcast recently that Covid provided a “dry-run” for Big Oil and the energy sector writ large for what we need to do to avert the irreversible, catastrophic potential impacts of climate change. “It's going to be that rate of decline that is needed to achieve some of the commitments that we're making across the globe…by the timeline of 2050,” adding that, “it's really interesting to see what it required in the last 18 months to actually hit that and what it means going forward.” GLASGOW, SCOTLAND - OCTOBER 13: Artists paint a mural on a a wall next to the Clydeside Expressway ...

As global leaders, including President Joe Biden, converge there in person for the first time in two years, the ESG era – for environment, social and governance – is now a C-level business, economic and geopolitical strategy, as well as an investment one.

Surround Yourself With Amazing Latina Women In past economic crises, talk of protecting the environment might have taken a back seat to getting the economy back on track. Not this time. “What is intriguing,” Pavlovsky said, “is that the dialogue around environmental, social, governance, and climate did not slow in the (energy) sector in part, because I think it was obvious the evidence of what actually can be realized when we have, our activities reduced, whether it's on the commercial level, whether it's on the personal level.” Here are six ways Pavlovsky said covid jolted Big Oil and the energy ecosystem into an ESG-focused “new normal”: Kathryn Pavlovsky, head of Deloitte's Energy, Resources & Industrials practice Deloitte · Changed demands for energy : When millions of people are continuing to work remotely, or coming to the office part-time, Pavlovsky asks, “Are you just displacing the consumption, or are you actually reducing it?” And, what does that mean, “recognizing that the cost models that (they) operated on the past, aren't going to carry forward into the future?” · Big Oil goes “net zero”: “ Many (energy) companies during the height of the pandemic were announcing their net zero goals,” Pavlovsky pointed out, “Certain of the super majors like BP and Shell actually hardened their goals and announced production cuts going forward over the next decade through automation and looking for opportunities to do this.” BP said it will be net zero by 2050 “or sooner,” seeking to “decarbonize and diversify into different forms of energy, such as renewables, biofuels ‎and hydrogen,” while also keeping oil and gas in their mix.

[+] a rally (Photo by Erik McGregor/LightRocket via Getty Images) LightRocket via Getty Images · Strong investor pressure: Climate-activist investors are making an impact . For example, Exxon-Mobil was forced by activist investors to swap out a couple of long-term board members for those more climate-focused. Since then, the company is reportedly considering announcing its own net zero goals. · Increased transparency demands : The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulatory bodies are developing new reporting rules, based on demands from investors amid confusion due to the current array of voluntary reporting systems. Pavlovsky insists that, among Big Oil and the energy sector players overall, “there is a welcoming and a reception to receiving the additional guidance, to drive the consistency in the reporting…to having a roadmap.” She said these rules would enable more accurate comparisons between companies and industries. · A transformed energy workplace : What does “return to work” look like now in the energy sector? Pavlovsky highlighted that these massive changes converge with “significant advancement in both information technology, as well as operational technologies,… (for example) the pandemic was certainly an accelerator for digital.” These both change the configuration of the energy sector workplace and could smooth the transition to this “new normal” that demands less energy, less fossil fuel and dramatically fewer emissions. “We did see that the industry accelerated its energy transition.” Woman in STEM Christina Morillo for pexels · New needs and new skills create a more diverse workforce : One of the most intriguing things Pavlovsky said in our interview is that the rapid shift to new information, digital and operational technologies expedited by Covid-19 opens job and career opportunities for more diverse populations. “If you look at the challenges ahead of the industry and ESG and,” she said, “and what has been forced through the pandemic, it actually opens up, I think the option to really drive more diversity, and attract more women to the workforce.” She added that, “the combination of the nature of the work and the reskilling, as well as the hybrid model and, and what they open up for women in terms of creating more flexibility.” Now for the hard part though. The pandemic forced the energy sector to address all this low-hanging fruit in their business models and operations to reduce emissions and pivot to the new demands. “We're now getting to a place in the journey where it's getting harder,” Pavlovsky says. But the energy sector can play a crucial role in ESG 2.0. “They also recognize they can be a really significant part of the solution…..(and) can contribute. Whether it's our technological solutions, whether it's the talent that we bring to the market, we actually have a real role in shaping this across industries and sectors globally.” Listen to Joan’s full interview with Kathryn Pavlovsky on Electric Ladies podcast here .",https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/0x0/filters%3Aformat%28jpg%29/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/6175a2ab94c2b393721d73f1/0x0.jpg,forbes

Packers’ Davante Adams could miss Cardinals showdown on COVID list,https://nypost.com/2021/10/25/packers-davante-adams-goes-on-covid-19-reserve/,,['Associated Press'],,The Packers likely will have to face the unbeaten Cardinals without 2020 All-Pro receiver Davante Adams and defensive coordinator Joe Barry.,The Packers likely will have to face the unbeaten Cardinals without 2020 All-Pro receiver Davante Adams and defensive coordinator Joe Barry.,2021-10-25 21:42:14,"GREEN BAY, Wis. — The Green Bay Packers likely will have to face the unbeaten Arizona Cardinals without 2020 All-Pro receiver Davante Adams and defensive coordinator Joe Barry. General manager Brian Gutekunst announced Monday afternoon that the team has placed Adams on the reserve/COVID-19 list. That announcement came just over an hour after coach Matt LaFleur confirmed that Barry had tested positive. LaFleur said that Barry is fully vaccinated and therefore possibly could join the Packers (6-1) for Thursday night’s game if he tested negative Tuesday and Wednesday. “But I’m not going to hold my breath on that,” LaFleur said. LaFleur spoke to reporters before the announcement regarding Adams, who is tied for second in the NFL in catches (73) and is third in yards receiving (744). He did say there were “potentially some other issues with staff.” The reserve/COVID-19 list is for players who either test positive or have close contact with someone who’s infected. LaFleur said the Packers are in advanced protocols and conducted all of Monday’s coaches meetings virtually. LaFleur said all team personnel have to wear masks while in the building, whether or not they’re vaccinated. The Packers are working through which assistant will be responsible for calling defensive plays Thursday if Barry’s unavailable. One candidate could be defensive backs coach Jerry Gray, who has been a defensive coordinator with the Buffalo Bills (2001-05) and Tennessee Titans (2011-13). “I think regardless of how we do it, it’ll be a collective effort with everybody involved and having an input,” LaFleur said. “But certainly you feel confident with a guy like Jerry, who’s called it before and has had a top-five defense in this league. So we definitely have people that we feel are capable of getting the job done.”",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/davante-adams-packers-covid-status.jpg?quality=90&strip=all,nypost

Read Full Article at RT.com","Republican-controlled states are increasingly trying to recruit law enforcement officers who lose their jobs because of Covid-19 jab mandates, and Florida may soon up the ante by offering displaced cops a $5,000 relocation bonus. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis told Fox News on Sunday that he hopes to sign legislation authorizing the hiring bonuses as part of an effort to fight “unconstitutional” vaccine orders and fill a need for more officers in his state. The Republican governor on Friday called a special legislative session to pass bills needed to protect residents from losing their jobs because of jab orders. Also on rt.com Chicago’s mayor & police union duel in court over Covid-19 vaccine mandate as gun violence continues to careen out of control “In Florida, not only are we going to want to protect the law enforcement and all the jobs, we’re actually actively working to recruit out-of-state law enforcement because we do have needs in our police and our sheriff’s departments,” DeSantis said in a Fox News interview, citing vaccine mandates in such states as Washington and New York.

And Mr Sunak is expected to hike the minimum wage from £8.91 — with some sources suggesting it could go up to as much as £9.45. That would give the two million or so on rock-bottom figure a £1,000 annual increase for a 35-hour week from next year. The potential five per cent rise comes just weeks after Boris Johnson said Brits deserved to be paid more. And it puts the national minimum wage well on target to hit £10 by the time of the next general election, scheduled for 2024. Currently, Brits aged 23 and over are entitled to be paid a minimum of £8.91 per hour, with a lower sum of £8.36 for 21 and 22-year-olds. Most read in The Sun CHEW ARE YER?

The PM told the Conservative Party conference in Manchester this month: “We are not going back to the same old broken model with low wages, low growth, low skills and low productivity.” And he urged businesses to put up wages. But senior Tories are very aware such a plea would need to be matched by the Government giving support. Shops and hauliers have already been forced to hike wages in an attempt to fill worker shortages. Sainsbury’s and Morrisons are both offering above minimum wage as the supermarkets look to hire thousands of Christmas temps. And aspiring lorry drivers have been offered £1,000 joining bonuses and higher wages as firms struggle with the HGV driver shortfall.

""Well-informed about drone usage, Modi wants drones to connect the remote areas of the country. Apart from delivery of medicines and others to people living in remote places, he also said drones could also deliver postal packages to them,"" Jayaprakash told IANS. ""I was astonished over how hands-on he was on drones. He was keen on knowing the industry's reaction to the recent policy initiatives. I said India will become the drone capital of the world soon. The Prime Minister also said the services offered by drones should be affordable,"" he added. Like e-commerce, fintech, online food delivery sectors, the revised policies will drive the Indian drone industry, he said. Jayaprakash, who had created quite a splash in the international swimming pools to win medals for India, also told Modi about Garuda Aerospace's drone activities in Varanasi, the Lok Sabha constituency from which the Prime Minister was elected. Jayaprakash met Modi on October 22 after clearing the Covid-19 test the previous day.

Ardern accused of ‘jab rape’ by ex-TV host,https://www.news.com.au/technology/environment/extv-host-accuses-jacinda-ardern-accused-of-jab-rape-blames-her-for-nz-earthquake/news-story/53e71a7b3f58143606cb23a093e2873a,,,,A former high-profile New Zealand television and radio presenter has taken aim at the government and Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern in a controversial and bizarre anti-vaccine rant.,,2021-10-24 23:29:00,"A former high-profile New Zealand television and radio presenter has taken aim at the government and Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern in a controversial and bizarre anti-vaccine rant. Former Breakfast, Good Morning and Radio NZ presenter Liz Gunn made the emotional claims, saying Friday’s earthquake that hit the central North Island was Mother Nature’s response to Ardern’s new vaccine mandates. In a video online, Gunn relayed a message saying the worst part of the newly-announced system — which maintains stricter restrictions for the unvaccinated — is its ability to “separate us” from one another. The former presenter then hit out at Ardern claiming mandatory vaccinations are “rape” and that Mother Earth is rising up against a “tyrannical” leader. “Our mother, our jewel, this beautiful country said enough! Enough!” Gunn said. “I need other mothers to stand and with them the men who love their strength and power.” She then accused the Government of poisoning New Zealand’s children and the nation. “Because it is the mothers who know what is going on. The poisoning of our children, the poisoning of our air, the poisoning of our waters. The poisoning of New Zealand with these terrible ideas,” she said. “These completely misguided lies Ardern is telling us. The poisoning with arrogant tyrannical leaders. All of this is it stops with this earthquake. That’s what our mother was explaining to us. We must listen to her. Even those who think Ardern is amazing. “Stop and think, what will this country be like in a generation or two generations if a leader like this is allowed to jab rape. Because it is rape to force something in someone’s body.” Her video was posted on Saturday. In it, she also said the introduction of vaccine passports was a way to divide the nation and segregate people with different vaccine statuses from one another. Who is Liz Gunn? Gunn had previously been with TVNZ between 1990 and 2003. She was part of the original TVNZ Breakfast team alongside Mike Hosking and Susan Wood in 1997. In 2001, Gunn took Alison Mau’s place as host, forming a team alongside Hosking. But she sparked headlines in December that year when she quit the program live on air. At the time, it was reported that Gunn and Hosking had not clicked as a presenting team but TVNZ bosses were left scrambling when Gunn told viewers she wouldn’t be back in 2002. During that time, Gunn also worked at Radio New Zealand, hosting a number of shows before finishing up in 2016. She now is an executive producer and presenter for a creative content agency. Antivaxxers be like: Jacinda was the reason for the earthquake pic.twitter.com/nKkSIw6qIp Her rant comes after Ardern announced on Friday that New Zealand would move to a traffic light system to manage Covid-19 when District Health Boards have 90 per cent of their eligible population vaccinated. When each DHB hit this target, the new framework would come into effect. The traffic light system makes use of vaccine certificates. Businesses will be able to continue to operate at each of the risk levels, and each setting can be used in a highly targeted and localised way, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said. However, she warned those who aren’t vaccinated they won’t be able to share in some of the freedoms other Kiwis enjoy. “Vaccinations are our armour,” Ardern said when announcing the target and new traffic light system. “They help keep us safe. If you want summer, get vaccinated. If you want a haircut, get vaccinated. If you want to go to a gym or a sports event, get vaccinated. If you’re not vaccinated, there will be everyday things that you will miss out on,” Ardern said. How New Zealand’s traffic light system will work Red is for when the virus is spreading in a way that threatens the most vulnerable and could overwhelm the health system. Education will be open but with public health measures, masks will be needed and there will be caps and physical distancing requirements. At the red level, someone without a vaccine certificate cannot dine at a restaurant, attend a gathering of more than 10 people or go to the gym. Auckland will move into red when each of its three DHBs hit the 90 per cent target. “You are so close. Right now you’re just 16,000 vaccines away from every DHB hitting 90 per cent for first doses.” The rest of the country will move to orange when every other DHB hits the 90 per cent target. Orange means no limits if vaccine certificates are used for hospitality, gatherings and events. Limits will apply if no vaccine certificates are used. Green will have limits if no vaccine certificates are used for hospitality, gatherings and events. “It is quite simple: if you are a business that chooses to use vaccine certificates, you will get to operate at every level,” Ardern said. Ardern said the Government gave a lot of consideration to how religious groups and marae could gather and that is why it was only fair they could use vaccine certificates to ensure they are able to continue getting together. Some countries have not included faith-based groups in their vaccine certificate systems. Those that chose not to use the vaccine-based system would face tougher gathering restrictions. Ardern said the new framework was about being able to live our lives as safely as possible. The alert level system could still be used if it was needed again, but a new playbook was needed in the context of vaccines – and that’s what the traffic light system is. “I have no doubt we will do what it takes once again, and move forward safely together.” She said the strategy is “to minimise and protect”. — New Zealand Herald After copping a beating last week, more unpredictable weather is on its way with wild storms to lash Queensland.

School libraries move into the digital age,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/school-libraries-move-into-the-digital-age-1.4702822?localLinksEnabled=false,,,,"Trinity Comprehensive School in Ballymun has a striking design. Formed from the amalgamation of three post-primaries during the first phase of the stalled Ballymun regeneration project, the corridors at Trinity all wrap around an innovative school library. At any time of the day, the library – staffed by a full-time professional librarian – is a hive of activity. All students have at least one class timetabled in the library every week. Chess boards have grown into chess clubs. Poetry, creative writing, accelerated reading and events all happen there: the most recent event was the launch of the new book from RTÉ’s outgoing Washington correspondent, Brian O’Donovan, Four Years in the Cauldron. The librarian is constantly engaged with the students to make sure they are accessing the books they want – whether fiction, non-fiction or graphic novels – and also works with teachers to promote cross-curricular links. “A school library is transformational,” says Frances Neary, principal of Trinity Comprehensive. “It has given our students the opportunity to express themselves, to find words for their emotions without being judged, and simply to read for enjoyment rather than because they have to. “It is a place of refuge, escape, creativity, imagination and learning. But the librarian is central: otherwise, it’s just a room full of books without anyone there to show the potential within these books, without anyone to encourage and engage the students.” In 2005, a three-year pilot project to provide libraries to 10 disadvantaged schools issued its report. This led to a commitment to expand school libraries to 50 support school programmes with the highest level of disadvantage by 2010, with further expansion to be considered thereafter. But the expansion went on hold during the recession and, more than a decade later, has never been realised. Meaningful impact “There are now 30 libraries in the programme, which leaves over 200 Deis/ Junior Cycle Support Programme (JCSP) schools that don’t have school library supports,” says Kathleen Moran, senior librarian with the JCSP Demonstration Library Project. “It was disappointing to see there was nothing for school libraries in the recent budget. We’ve been knocking on the door for so long but it has never been back on the table.” Budget 2022 saw the Department of Education commit €20 million as a once-off capital allocation to schools for the purchase of books, audio books and other equipment. But Moran and principals of schools say that these resources need a library and a librarian if they are to make a meaningful impact. Brian O’Donovan, RTÉ Washington correspondent, launching his book, Four Years in the Cauldron, with Frank Christian Ajoc and Thembi Nkosi at Trinity Comprehensive School in Ballymun. Photograph: Damien Eagers At St Paul’s CBS, North Brunswick Street, Dublin 7, school principal Patrick McCormack says that their library has improved student engagement and retention. “I believe that every secondary school should have a library,” he says. “A fully resourced library is not just books on a shelf, but is a librarian working with the teaching staff and students in the school. “We have interactive materials, games, educational software and recreational spaces. We lend chess sets, board games and, crucially, digital readers to students. Schools should not have to be begging for this: it should be a nailed-on, protected resource.” The closure of the library during Covid, and subsequent restrictions and limitations on access, has brought this home for McCormack. “A box of books is not the same as a librarian who is a friendly face for the students and a person they can get support from. Our librarian, Annie Brady, was chosen as Librarian of the Year for the whole of Ireland and the UK in 2015. She organises coffee morning for the parents, she links in with the local primary school so that when children come to our secondary, they’re already familiar with the library. Storytelling classes “She involves herself with the teachers, SNAs and students; she makes sure the student voice is heard; she supports professional development; she runs oral storytelling classes with professional seanchaís; she organises musicians and other speakers to come in.” Moran oversees and supports all 30 of these libraries, but she has limited resources. The JCSP library project works with organisations like Poetry Ireland, Children’s Books Ireland, public libraries and third-level libraries. One particularly interesting initiative involved a collaboration with the Museum of Literature Ireland (MoLI), UCD’s school of English and astrophysics researchers at the UCD school of physics involving creative writing workshops. Students did online Zoom tutorials to write a poem on the theme of home, which has been etched onto the side of EirSat, Ireland’s first satellite (developed by UCD’s C-Space, the first Irish centre dedicated to collaborative space research and industry). Having had four administrative support staff when the project started, Moran is essentially alone now. At the same time, the demand for their services increased dramatically during Covid. “Our libraries were emptied of devices during Covid: we loaned them so young people could stay engaged,” says Moran. Kathleen Moran: “It was disappointing to see there was nothing for school libraries in the recent budget. We’ve been knocking on the door for so long.” Photograph: Damien Eagers “We do whatever needs to be done. We help close the achievement gap. The formal education system does not suit everyone and school libraries can come at learning from a different way, a way that suits every learner. “I had hundreds of requests from non-Deis schools for access to our digital library service during Covid, as well as requests for access from over 100 Youthreach centres,” says Moran. “I have quotations from suppliers to expand our digital library access to all 750 second-level schools and we could set it up very quickly if the funding and administrative supports were provided. “The set-up cost would be minimal and the main cost would be the purchase of additional ebooks, e-audiobooks and digital magazines – all of which would then be available to students and staff in every school in the country.” No school library? Visit your local It’s a simple but radical idea in many ways: a dedicated building where people can get books, audiobooks, educational resources and use of computers – all for free. In 2019, Ireland abolished library fines, another quietly radical move that has made this national resource more accessible to all. “It was a barrier to accessing information,” says Stuart Hamilton, head of libraries development at the Local Government Management Association. “Someone might get a fine in the early part of their library use and it deters them from going back. So now we trust them, and because people have such a positive relationship with their library, there’s a feeling of mutual trust and a social responsibility.” There are over seven million library visits per year, and the number of active members is growing. Unstaffed hours The “open library” initiative has seen more libraries stay open for a number of unstaffed hours so that they can be used by more people, and RB Digital – available to any library user – is a massive digital resource of free magazines including National Geographic, Rolling Stone, the Economist, the New Yorker and more. Digital services have expanded to allow users to borrow audio books. The library’s Right to Read programme involves four different events for children throughout the year, all aimed at increasing literacy and developing a love of reading. “The buildings had to close during Covid, but we made it easier for people to join online,” says Hamilton. “We ran book clubs, coding events and children’s story time through Zoom, and discovered new audiences. We did home delivery services for some users and worked with Age Action to get older people online. We worked hard to maintain our connection with our users and are so glad to be opening up again.” See LibrariesIreland.ie for more information",,2021-10-25 23:00:00,"Trinity Comprehensive School in Ballymun has a striking design.

She organises coffee morning for the parents, she links in with the local primary school so that when children come to our secondary, they’re already familiar with the library. “She involves herself with the teachers, SNAs and students; she makes sure the student voice is heard; she supports professional development; she runs oral storytelling classes with professional seanchaís; she organises musicians and other speakers to come in.” Moran oversees and supports all 30 of these libraries, but she has limited resources. The JCSP library project works with organisations like Poetry Ireland, Children’s Books Ireland, public libraries and third-level libraries. One particularly interesting initiative involved a collaboration with the Museum of Literature Ireland (MoLI), UCD’s school of English and astrophysics researchers at the UCD school of physics involving creative writing workshops. Students did online Zoom tutorials to write a poem on the theme of home, which has been etched onto the side of EirSat, Ireland’s first satellite (developed by UCD’s C-Space, the first Irish centre dedicated to collaborative space research and industry). Having had four administrative support staff when the project started, Moran is essentially alone now. At the same time, the demand for their services increased dramatically during Covid. “Our libraries were emptied of devices during Covid: we loaned them so young people could stay engaged,” says Moran. “We do whatever needs to be done. We help close the achievement gap. The formal education system does not suit everyone and school libraries can come at learning from a different way, a way that suits every learner. “I had hundreds of requests from non-Deis schools for access to our digital library service during Covid, as well as requests for access from over 100 Youthreach centres,” says Moran. “I have quotations from suppliers to expand our digital library access to all 750 second-level schools and we could set it up very quickly if the funding and administrative supports were provided. “The set-up cost would be minimal and the main cost would be the purchase of additional ebooks, e-audiobooks and digital magazines – all of which would then be available to students and staff in every school in the country.” No school library? Visit your local It’s a simple but radical idea in many ways: a dedicated building where people can get books, audiobooks, educational resources and use of computers – all for free. In 2019, Ireland abolished library fines, another quietly radical move that has made this national resource more accessible to all. “It was a barrier to accessing information,” says Stuart Hamilton , head of libraries development at the Local Government Management Association . “Someone might get a fine in the early part of their library use and it deters them from going back. So now we trust them, and because people have such a positive relationship with their library, there’s a feeling of mutual trust and a social responsibility.” There are over seven million library visits per year, and the number of active members is growing. The “open library” initiative has seen more libraries stay open for a number of unstaffed hours so that they can be used by more people, and RB Digital – available to any library user – is a massive digital resource of free magazines including National Geographic, Rolling Stone, the Economist, the New Yorker and more. Digital services have expanded to allow users to borrow audio books. The library’s Right to Read programme involves four different events for children throughout the year, all aimed at increasing literacy and developing a love of reading. “The buildings had to close during Covid, but we made it easier for people to join online,” says Hamilton. “We ran book clubs, coding events and children’s story time through Zoom, and discovered new audiences. We did home delivery services for some users and worked with Age Action to get older people online. We worked hard to maintain our connection with our users and are so glad to be opening up again.” See LibrariesIreland.ie for more information",https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4702821.1634479793!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg,irishtimes

The Russian government's coronavirus task force tallied 37,930 new confirmed cases in 24 hours, the highest number since the start of the pandemic. The task force also reported 1,069 more COVID-19 deaths in the same period, slightly fewer than a record of 1,075 reached over the weekend. Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered Russians not to go to work between Oct. 30 and Nov. 7, when the country will observe an extended holiday. In some of Russia's 85 regions where the situation is particularly grave, Putin said the nonworking period could begin earlier and be extended beyond Nov. 7. During that time, most state organizations and private businesses, except for those operating key infrastructure and a few others, are to halt work. Officials in Moscow plan to order the off-work period to start Thursday. Gyms, most entertainment venues and most stores are to be closed for 11 days along with kindergartens and schools. Restaurants and cafes will only be open for takeout or delivery orders during that period. Food stores and pharmacies can stay open. Access to museums, theaters, concert halls and other venues will be limited to those holding digital codes on their smartphones to prove vaccination or past illness, a practice that will remain in place after Nov. 7. Russian authorities hope the idle time will help limit the spread of the virus by keeping people out of offices and off public transportation, where mask mandates have been loosely enforced. Overall, Russia has registered over 8.2 million confirmed virus cases and 231,669 deaths, by far the highest death toll in Europe and the fifth-highest in the world after the United States, Brazil, India and Mexico. The government has blamed the latest spike in infections and deaths on low vaccination rates and lax public attitudes toward taking precautions. Only about 45 million Russians — roughly a third of the country's nearly 146 million people — are fully vaccinated. Russia was the first country in the world to authorize a coronavirus vaccine, launching Sputnik V in August 2020, and has plentiful supplies. But uptake has been slow, blamed in part on conflicting signals from authorities. ___ Follow AP's pandemic coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic Vladimir Isachenkov, The Associated Press",,nsnews

Supporters of paid sick leave in B.C. advocate from Vancouver and Victoria,https://vancouver.citynews.ca/2021/10/24/vancouver-victoria-paid-sick-leave/,,['alylaube'],,People in Vancouver and Victoria who want B.C. to give workers 10 paid sick days took to the streets Monday to rally for action from the Horgan government.,"A so-called “COVID-safe Day of Action” is taking place Monday in Metro Vancouver and Victoria, with groups hoping to pressure the Horgan government to follow through with its plans to bring in mandatory paid sick leave for workers. Raj Khunkhun, VP with Community Savings Credit Union, says his organization is advocating for 10 paid sick days. “We’re lagging behind comparable countries like New Zealand and Australia. They already introduced 10 paid sick days. Germany actually has 30,” he said. “The federal government is poised to bring in 10 paid sick days for federally regulated workers, so we think B.C. should introduce 10 paid sick days as well.” Related Articles: B.C. seeks input on length of paid sick leave Some B.C. businesses still resistant to paid sick leave: CFIB Health-care workers demand Trudeau fast track paid sick-leave policy The Horgan government is expected to pass legislation before the end of the year to bring in paid sick leave, despite opposition from certain groups — including the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. But Khunkhun says having provincially-mandated paid sick days isn’t going to deter businesses. “We have always provided 12 paid sick days, but we provided a further 10 paid sick days during the pandemic, very early on, and also an additional six hours a week off just to get groceries because the line-ups were long,” said Khunkhun. They found there was no impact to their bottom line and had their most profitable year to-date. “We don’t want people to have to decide between getting paid fully and putting others at risk. We don’t think that should be a burden on the worker. They should also be able to take the time off, and that will also help our healthcare system, which is already really stressed right now,” added Khunkhun.",2021-10-25 00:59:19,,https://vancouver.citynews.ca/wp-content/blogs.dir/sites/9/2021/01/sneeze-1431371.jpg,citynews1130

Both companies reined in their total spending on bonus payments in the 2021 financial year, with NBN splashing $46.5 million on staff, down from $78 million in the 2020 financial year , while Australia Post rewarded employees to the tune of $79 million compared with $92 million last year . Australia Post rewarded employees to the tune of $79 million compared with $92 million last year. Credit: Ryan Stuart This amounts to $295.9 million across the two years of the pandemic, the companies’ annual reports show. Public fury prompted a government crackdown on generous executive bonuses, with the Australian Public Service Commission recently issuing updated guidance to Commonwealth entities on senior executive bonuses, saying not to pay them unless there were “exceptional circumstances or a contractual obligation”. But a spokesman for Communications Minister Paul Fletcher said the new guidance would only apply from this financial year onward, adding remuneration paid by government-owned businesses “is a matter for their respective boards”. “NBN Co and Australia Post operate in a competitive commercial environment and have to attract and retain staff with the necessary skills and expertise to manage these complex telecommunications and logistics businesses,” the spokesman said. Australia Post executives who were forced to forgo their bonuses in 2020 at the height of the pandemic’s economic crisis and amid complaints about delivery delays, had them reinstated this year. Rodney Boys, who acted as chief executive for 10 months following Christine Holgate’s controversial exit in November, earned an annual salary of $1.8 million, including a $730,438 bonus this year. In total, the postal service’s top eight executives will share in a total of $4.8 million in bonuses this year, with each also receiving a bump in base salary. For example, executive general manager Nicole Sheffield received a $100,000 pay rise this year, plus a $714,000 bonus, taking her total salary to more than $1.5 million. Labor communications spokeswoman Michelle Rowland was scathing of executive payouts. “During a period of parcel delays and broader economic distress, the Australia Post board has stuffed excessive cash bonuses into the pockets of executives,” Ms Rowland said. “This is nothing short of a slap in the face to the Australian taxpayer.” NBN Co CEO Stephen Rue had his bonus cut back by almost 40 per cent to $734,000 this year. The pay packet of NBN boss Stephen Rue, who was one of the highest-paid public executives in 2020 earning a $3.1 million salary, took a trim to $2.6 million this year as his bonus was cut back by almost 40 per cent to $734,000. NBN executives were paid bonuses in both 2020 and 2021, although most were slightly reduced this year. New Australia Post boss Paul Graham, who began in the top job last month, will be paid a base salary of $1.4 million, with the possibility to double this through bonuses. Both Mr Graham and Mr Rue will appear at a Senate estimates hearing on Tuesday. An Australia Post spokesman said over 2000 payments were to frontline workers “who have managed through extraordinary circumstances to deliver for our customers and our community”. “Remuneration is regularly benchmarked externally and must be positioned competitively to attract, motivate and retain highly skilled senior managers. It reflects their responsibilities, performance, qualifications and experience,” the spokesman said. A spokesman for NBN Co said the $46.5 million in bonuses represented 5 per cent of the company’s wages and salary costs, and was spread across 3500 employees. “It is the communities’ judgement of our performance in providing affordable access to a ubiquitous, resilient and fit-for-purpose network which informs, in part, the board’s approach to setting annual incentives. The COVID circumstances have tested NBN Co and left our customers reassured,” the spokesman said.",,smh

Part of said money was placed in a bank account, and part was spent on one single Pokemon card.

The court documents do not disclose the exact card purchased, but DO give the exact amount of cash spent on said card. As sleuthed by Polygon, a card auction with an ending bid matching the price quoted by court documents was, indeed, a Charizard. As shown on PWCC Marketplace , this Charizard was graded by Beckett as 9.5 gem mint, with grading code 0011532499. That’ll be handy if we ever want to discover the pathway of ownership for this card. Not that the card needed any more infamy, as several similar cards have sold quite recently for massive amounts of cash. This card had an end bid on December 28, 2020. That lines up with the suggested purchase date of “on or about January 8, 2021.” This, as well as the rest of the fraud outlined by court documents this week, were “all done in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1343.” The base crime here was that the Georgia man allegedly presented false information in an Economic Injury Disaster Loans document intended for small businesses experiencing financial disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic. False and fraudulent representations are alleged to have been made by Vinath Oudomsine (also known as Georgia man), to the United States Small Business Administration. Documents filed with case 3:21-cr-00013-DHB-BKE with the United States District Court, Southern District of Georgia, Dublin Division, can be found online via Law and Crime this week. If convicted of Wire Fraud, the defendant could face up to 20 years in prison, up to a $250k fine, and up to three years of supervised release.",,slashgear

Virtual lung cancer screening is just as effective as in-person screening,https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-10-virtual-lung-cancer-screening-effective.html,['Oncology & Cancer'],,,"A novel telemedicine lung cancer screening effort during the COVID-19 pandemic shows that virtual single-visit screenings are just as effective as single-visit screenings done in person at the hospital, according to a study presented at the American College of Surgeons (ACS) Virtual Clinical Congress 2021.",,2021-10-24 07:30:18,"A novel telemedicine lung cancer screening effort during the COVID-19 pandemic shows that virtual single-visit screenings are just as effective as single-visit screenings done in person at the hospital, according to a study presented at the American College of Surgeons (ACS) Virtual Clinical Congress 2021. The study of virtual lung cancer screenings (LCS) was performed at Temple University Hospital, Philadelphia, which has a large African American patient population. African Americans face disparities in care, especially for lung cancer. They are less likely to be screened and treated for lung cancer and more likely to die from it, compared with the general population , explained Jessica S. Magarinos, MD, a general surgery resident at Temple University Hospital and first author of the study. Although the authors hypothesized that LCS disparities would be exacerbated during COVID-19, this was not the case, she said. ""Our study shows that telemedicine screenings were able to reach the African American population in a safety net hospital,"" Dr. Magarinos reported. More people need to be screened for lung cancer More people die of lung cancer every year than from any other type of cancer. Although lung cancer can be successfully treated if caught early enough, only about 3-to-6 percent of the population eligible for LCS get screened, said Cherie P. Erkmen, MD, FACS, a thoracic surgeon at Temple University Hospital and the principal investigator for the retrospective study. ""Overall, we do a sorrowful job of getting people to undergo lung cancer screening,"" Dr. Erkmen said. ""We can reduce preventable lung cancer death by finding novel ways of getting people screened."" With the advent of COVID-19 pandemic, many patients—acting on advice from such scientific advisory groups such as the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST)—decided to defer getting screened for lung cancer. The authors at Temple University in Philadelphia decided to quickly pivot to offer telemedicine lung cancer screenings, which mitigates the risk of exposure to the COVID-19 virus. Earlier this year, the ACS was one of the major health care organizations that issued a call for patients to not miss cancer screenings due to COVID-19. Study details The researchers compared 673 patients who received single-visit lung cancer screening (LCS) patients before the COVID-19 pandemic with 440 patients who received Single Encounter Telemedicine Lung Cancer Screening (SET-LCS) since March of 2020, when the pandemic began to prompt shutdowns across the U.S. For the LCS population, the authors retrospectively analyzed prospectively collected data from February 2021 and earlier; for both groups, they looked at race, smoking history, educational status, Lung-RADS * , cancer diagnosis and stage, and adherence to follow-up using the Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test. Study findings The distribution of patient race before and after COVID-19 was not significantly different; in each case, the largest group of screened patients was African American (52 percent before, 37 percent after), Dr. Magarinos said. Smoking history was significantly different; 65 percent of those undergoing screening before COVID-19 were active smokers compared with 33 percent after COVID-19. The authors concluded there was no significant difference in the distribution of Lung-RADs results (single visit vs. telemedicine): The authors also concluded there was no significant difference in the frequency of procedures for cancer diagnoses. These multiple findings led the researchers to conclude that telemedicine screening was just as effective as in-person screenings. Although the telemedicine approach allowed many patients to get screened for lung cancer, overall the number of people who were screened for lung cancer during the pandemic declined by 75 percent, according to the authors. Dr. Erkmen hopes continued telemedicine lung cancer screenings after the pandemic will eliminate some barriers to getting screened and will result in more people getting screened. The authors believe that telemedicine screening is applicable to other types of cancers, including breast cancer or colorectal cancer screening, said Dr. Magarinos.

Ulster diplomat’s lessons from North Korea: ‘Keep talking’,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/asia-pacific/ulster-diplomat-s-lessons-from-north-korea-keep-talking-1.4710076?localLinksEnabled=false,,,,"Growing up in Co Tyrone during the Troubles, Colin Crooks was “fascinated” by the idea of the Border. “There was another country, another entity, not very far away, with this Border that we couldn’t really go across – or didn’t really go across,” he says. “Probably there’s something really deep-seated in me that made me fascinated when I went to South Korea by the idea that there was another Korea which you couldn’t really get to. “Of course, the Irish Border is very, very different from the Korean border, you have the DMZ [demilitarised zone], this heavily fortified almost completely impenetrable barrier across the peninsula, whereas in Ireland the Border’s practically became invisible. “I think there are lessons that we can take from the experience in Northern Ireland about reconciliation – there are still challenges, but nonetheless there are lessons.” Since December 2018, Crooks has been the British ambassador to North Korea. As the queen’s representative and London’s “man” in Pyongyang, he was also one of the last people from either Britain or Ireland to set foot in a country often billed as the world’s most secretive state. North Korea’s response to Covid-19 was to “completely seal” its borders; by May last year the decision was taken to close the embassy and Crooks and his staff were forced to leave, “driving on dirt roads to the Chinese border”. The last European diplomats left earlier this month. Odd mix The question everyone asks, says Crooks, is “what is North Korea like?” “It’s impossible to summarise. It’s an odd mix of the ordinary and the bizarre.” There is an almost complete absence of advertising, and people dress very conservatively. “You don’t see people really hanging around doing nothing, they’re always walking somewhere or doing something. And then there are the contrasts when you get out of the city and into the rest of the country.” Crooks first visited North Korea in 2008. When he returned as ambassador in 2018 he was struck by “how much more glitzy things appeared” in Pyongyang. “There’d clearly been quite a lot of investment in buildings, a little bit more commercial activity, newer vehicles and taxis going around.” However, in the countryside there had been little difference. “Things are much more basic, not much mechanisation, very few tractors, people are ploughing the fields by hand and getting around on bicycles or ox carts.” Covid-19 and the closure of North Korea’s borders has prompted particular concern. Before this, says Crooks, 40 per cent of people were food insecure, according to the UN. “I can’t believe that’s got any better and it may have got worse, we simply don’t know. We are concerned, and that’s one of the reasons we’d like to get an international presence back in to assess the needs and to see if any assistance is required.” Diplomatic career From Dungannon, Co Tyrone, Crooks credits his diplomatic career to a childhood fascination “with the thought that there were other places I hadn’t seen” – fuelled by maps and encyclopedias in his family home – and to his teachers at Royal School Dungannon who “encouraged ambition and encouraged us to widen our horizons”. He studied French and German at the University of Cambridge before joining the foreign office, where he tried “things that were a little bit more far flung” with postings in Washington, Jakarta and Seoul. Of his time in Pyongyang, he says:“They are nervous about the outside world and from time to time you would spot that someone might be filming you or there might be people keeping an eye on you, but I never really worried too much about it. “A big part of our mission is to work towards resolving the tensions and removing the threat of nuclear conflict and of conflict generally,” he says, emphasising the importance of keeping channels of communication open. There are also efforts to promote cultural links. “It’s tiny steps ... nevertheless I believe there are so few people trying to do this in North Korea that anything we do manage to do when conditions are right helps shine a light into a place that many people don’t understand.” With North Korea’s borders still closed, Crooks accepts it is unlikely he will be able to return before his posting runs out; he is due to take up the position of British ambassador to South Korea next year. One of the “exciting things” about his next posting is the vibrancy of South Korea’s popular culture. “Squid Game is just one example of the ‘Korean Wave’,” he says, which has seen “K-Pop stars like BTS gain worldwide stardom and films like Parasite have appealed to a global audience. “It’s another area where the contrast between North and South is very sharp.” Not unique Crooks is “very proud” to be from Northern Ireland, and acknowledges that it has influenced him as a diplomat. Equally, he believes that travelling the world and living in different countries has “probably changed my perception of Northern Ireland as well”. In other places he learned that his experience of growing up during the Troubles was “not unique – there are lots of countries, of regions where people struggle with history, where people struggle with very deep-seated issues with their neighbours”. “Every place is unique, and you can’t apply the same solution to every place, but one thing that I have become increasingly convinced of is the value of dialogue and of listening and of trying to understand the other person. “Diplomacy is about listening, it’s also about talking ... applying that to Northern Ireland, surely dialogue and both speaking and listening have to be something that has to be done. “You’re not necessarily going to persuade the other person – that’s one thing that is certainly true in North Korea – but nonetheless you have to keep talking.”",,2021-10-26 02:15:12,"Growing up in Co Tyrone during the Troubles, Colin Crooks was “fascinated” by the idea of the Border. “There was another country, another entity, not very far away, with this Border that we couldn’t really go across – or didn’t really go across,” he says. “Probably there’s something really deep-seated in me that made me fascinated when I went to South Korea by the idea that there was another Korea which you couldn’t really get to. “Of course, the Irish Border is very, very different from the Korean border, you have the DMZ [demilitarised zone], this heavily fortified almost completely impenetrable barrier across the peninsula, whereas in Ireland the Border’s practically became invisible. “I think there are lessons that we can take from the experience in Northern Ireland about reconciliation – there are still challenges, but nonetheless there are lessons.” Since December 2018, Crooks has been the British ambassador to North Korea.

China to start vaccinating children to age 3 as cases spread,https://www.nsnews.com/coronavirus-covid-19-national-news/china-to-start-vaccinating-children-to-age-3-as-cases-spread-4546629,,['Canadian Press'],,"TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Children as young as 3 will start receiving COVID-19 vaccines in China, where 76% of the population has been fully vaccinated and authorities are maintaining a zero-tolerance policy toward outbreaks.",,2021-10-25 14:35:56,"TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Children as young as 3 will start receiving COVID-19 vaccines in China, where 76% of the population has been fully vaccinated and authorities are maintaining a zero-tolerance policy toward outbreaks. China becomes one of the very few countries in the world to start vaccinating children that young against the virus. Cuba, for one, has begun a vaccine drive for children as young as 2. The U.S. and many European countries allow COVID-19 shots down to age 12, though the U.S. is moving quickly toward opening vaccinations to 5- to 11-year-olds. Local city and provincial level governments in at least five Chinese provinces issued notices in recent days announcing that children ages 3 to 11 will be required to get their vaccinations. The expansion of the vaccination campaign comes as parts of China take new clampdown measures to try to stamp out small outbreaks. Gansu, a northwestern province heavily dependent on tourism, closed all tourist sites Monday after finding new COVID-19 cases. Residents in parts of Inner Mongolia have been ordered to stay indoors because of an outbreak there. The National Health Commission reported that 35 new cases of local transmission had been detected over the past 24 hours, four of them in Gansu. An additional 19 cases were found in the Inner Mongolia region, with others scattered around the country. China has employed lockdowns, quarantines and compulsory testing for the virus throughout the pandemic and has largely stamped out cases of local infection while fully vaccinating 1.07 billion people out of a population of 1.4 billion. In particular, the government is concerned about the spread of the more contagious delta variant by travelers and about having a largely vaccinated public ahead of the Beijing Olympics in February. Overseas spectators already have been banned from the Winter Games, and participants will have to stay in a bubble separating them from people outside. China's most widely used vaccines, from Sinopharm and Sinovac, have shown efficacy in preventing severe disease and transmission of the virus, based on public data. But the protection they offer against the delta variant has not been answered definitively, although officials say they remain protective. Hubei, Fujian and Hainan provinces all issued provincial level notices alerting new vaccination requirements, while individual cities in Zhejiang province and Hunan province have also issued similar announcements. China in June had approved two vaccines — Sinopharm's from the Beijing Institute of Biological Products and Sinovac — for children ages 3 to 17, but it has only been vaccinating those 12 and older. In August, regulators approved another, Sinopharm's from the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products. After the vaccines received domestic approval for children in China, foreign governments began giving the shots to children in their own countries. Cambodia uses both Sinovac and Sinopharm’s shots in children 6 to 11. Regulators in Chile approved Sinovac for children as young as 6. In Argentina, regulators approved the Sinopharm vaccine for children as young as age 3. Many developing countries left out of the race to get shots from Western pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer and Moderna bought Chinese vaccines. China has shipped more than 1.2 billion doses as of September, according to its Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Even with widespread domestic and global use, not every parent is reassured about the vaccine, citing less publicly available data on the shots. Wang Lu, who lives in the southern city of Fuzhou in Fujian province, said she isn’t particularly rushing to get her 3-year-old son vaccinated. “I’m just not very clear on the vaccine’s safety profile, so I don’t really want to get him vaccinated, at the very least, I don’t want to be the first,” Wang said. Sinovac started an efficacy trial with 14,000 child participants across multiple countries in September. Its approval in China was based on smaller phase 1 and phase 2 trials. Sinopharm’s Beijing shot was also approved based on smaller phase 1 and phase 2 trials. These were published later in peer-reviewed journals. Other parents said they weren’t concerned, given that many other people had already gotten the shot. Wu Cong, a mom of a 7-year old, said her daughter’s school in Shanghai hadn’t yet notified them of any vaccinations. “I think this isn’t too different from the flu vaccine, there’s already been so many people vaccinated, so I don’t have too many worries,” said Wu. ___ Associated Press researcher Chen Si in Shanghai contributed to this report.

Latest Government weekly figures, announced yesterday, show the rate of infection in the Dorset Council area is higher than that of Bournemouth Christchurch Poole (BCP) - both areas are seeing a rapid increase. Dorset Council's case rate stands at 611.1 per 100 thousand people - up from 477.6 the previous week - while BCP's is 521.2, up from 376.6. Director of Public Health Dorset, Sam Crowe, is now calling for residents to wear masks in indoor public areas - as well as urging people to carry out tests and ensure they have had both vaccinations. Director of Public Health Dorset Sam Crowe is calling on members of the public to prevent the spread Mr Crowe also said local hospital admissions have started to climb despite '""holding fairly steady in the last week."" ""In our local system, which is already really stressed, we don't have much room for manoeuvre,"" he added. ""Any additional admissions due to Covid just put more pressure on the hospital system, which is really trying hard to catch up with all of those people who have had delays to their urgent treatment during the pandemic."" Latest figures from NHS England show that 52 people were admitted to hospitals across the county with Covid-19 in the last week.

Read more: Government paving the way to bring in tough ‘plan B’ Covid rules ""I'm asking you to act: airborne transmission is really crucial that's how the virus spreads, so think about those measures that can prevent that happening. If you're meeting indoors remember to keep doors and windows open, ventilation is really crucial. Wear a mask if you're mixing with other people you wouldn't normally mix with in enclosed indoor areas and remember the importance of distance as well. ""Finally protect, so remember lateral flow testing is really important for spotting early cases and asymptomatic cases of Covid. Also, if you haven't had your vaccination or you're not up to date with your second jab, please do look out for those opportunities to get fully vaccinated."" Mr Crowe also urged those who have been offered a booster jab to ""please take up that opportunity."" ""Over the next few weeks, I'm just asking you to do all you can to try to help us keep a lid on our cases,"" he added. ""None of us want to go back to that situation where we saw restrictions being brought in, we've got a small window now where if we act together, hopefully we can stave off the need to bring in more serious measures further down the line."" A spokesperson for Dorset County Hospital added: “While we expect the Covid-19 immunisation programme to have a beneficial effect on the rates of admission in comparison with early 2021, we are nonetheless conscious of additional pressure the current increases in cases will have on our hospital and staff as we head into winter. “We continue to have stringent infection control and social distancing measures in place at our hospital in line with national guidance to keep the environment safe for our staff, patients and visitors.”",https://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/resources/images/13137519/,dorsetecho

U.S. to outline Nov. 8 international travel reopening The Biden administration plans to unveil detailed rules on Monday requiring nearly all foreign air visitors to be vaccinated against COVID-19 starting Nov. 8, sources told Reuters. The White House first disclosed on Sept. 20 it would remove restrictions in early November for fully vaccinated air travelers from 33 countries. South Korea plots course to scrapping COVID curbs South Korea unveiled a three-phase strategy to get back to normal from the coronavirus with all limits on gatherings and distancing gone by February, after it achieved a goal of vaccinating 70% of its people at the weekend. The scheme begins next Monday and is due to run until Feb. 20, by when all distancing curbs will be scrapped except for mask-wearing mandates, a government health panel said.

China reported 35 new domestically transmitted cases on Sunday, official data showed on Monday. Beijing accounted for 14 of the 168 cases reported between Oct. 17-24. The infection numbers are tiny compared to many outbreaks elsewhere in the world, but authorities have adopted a zero tolerance strategy, aggressively tracking potential infections. EU regulator starts real-time review of Merck pill U.S. drugmaker Merck & Co Inc said the European Union’s drug regulator has initiated a real-time review of its experimental COVID-19 antiviral drug for adults. Under the procedure, also known as a “rolling review,” the European Medicines Agency would assess data as soon as it becomes available, instead of waiting for a formal application when all required information has been gathered. While vaccines are the main weapons against COVID-19, Merck’s experimental pill molnupiravir could be a game-changer after studies showed it could halve the chances of dying or being hospitalized for those most at risk of contracting severe illness.

Experts predict cases could fall by 85% before Christmas in other unpublished models, it’s understood. The dramatic decline in infections ‘will happen without’ the introduction of mandatory face masks, vaccine passports and working from home measures.

"Alberta legislature resumes: Government focuses on economy, Opposition on COVID-19",https://www.princegeorgecitizen.com/national-business/alberta-legislature-resumes-government-focuses-on-economy-opposition-on-covid-19-4546787,,['Canadian Press'],,EDMONTON — The first day of the Alberta legislature's fall sitting signalled the government's intention to focus on the economy and the Opposition determined to hold the United Conservatives to account for mismanaging COVID-19.,,2021-10-25 22:28:39,"EDMONTON — The first day of the Alberta legislature's fall sitting signalled the government's intention to focus on the economy and the Opposition determined to hold the United Conservatives to account for mismanaging COVID-19. NDP Leader Rachel Notley accused Premier Jason Kenney and his cabinet of negligently downplaying the fourth wave of COVID-19, then disappearing in the summer as cases soared, resulting in hundreds of deaths and pushing hospital capacity to the breaking point. “The premier went on vacation. He left Alberta without leadership,” Notley said in question period Monday as she pointed across the aisle at Kenney and his cabinet. “Where was your health minister? Your deputy premier? Your finance minister? A single solitary adult over there? Where were they?” Kenney responded that every jurisdiction has had COVID-19 hard times and the NDP’s criticism is not helpful to solving the crisis. “They (the NDP) have always craved an Australian-style hard and brutal lockdown, the consequences of which would require turning this province into a virtual police state,” said Kenney. The premier has said he didn’t react with renewed rules to address the soaring summer case numbers until Sept. 3, because he didn’t believe a COVID-19-weary population would follow them. The numbers have been dropping slowly in recent weeks, but there are still 182 people infected with the virus receiving intensive care. The health system has had to double its normal amount of ICU beds, forcing the cancellation of thousands of non-urgent surgeries, and call in the military to handle the surge. Kenney said there will be a review eventually of how his government handled the COVID-19 pandemic. He rejected the NDP’s call for an all-party committee with subpoena powers to get to the bottom of what happened over the summer. Now is not the time to pull medical staff away from their duties, he said. The legislature is to sit for five of the next six weeks through to the beginning of December. There's to be a one-week break around Remembrance Day. Government house leader Jason Nixon said there will be 18 to 20 bills focused on creating jobs and diversifying the economy. “I will be putting forward a very robust legislative agenda inside the legislature. And we will be going very quickly around the clock — morning, noon and night — to be able to fulfil that agenda for Albertans,” Nixon said. Kenney introduced the first bill Monday to streamline how professional requirements are processed for those from out of province. “Occupations are regulated inconsistently across Canada, creating a patchwork of credential recognition that holds back skilled and certified workers,” Kenney told a news conference. The bill would affect more than 100 regulated professions, including nurses, accountants, real estate agents, firefighters, paramedics, engineers, insurance adjusters and horse jockeys. Professional bodies would have to make a decision on an application within a month of receiving it and establish timely appeals for those rejected. They would also have to make available online a breakdown of what documents are required to apply and the fees involved. Kenney said the legislation, coupled with low taxes, high oil prices and COVID-19 receding, would help Alberta’s bottom line rebound. “We are moving, I believe, probably into a strong and sustained cycle of economic growth,” said Kenney. “(But) we are hearing about labour shortages, not just in Alberta, but across the economy in North America, (so) this is going to become an emerging challenge.” Infrastructure Minister Prasad Panda introduced legislation to codify how capital projects are given a green light and a 20-year strategy for capital planning.

I, for one, am NOT. Lewy touts Nagelsmann (Bundesliga.com) Bayern Munich star striker Robert Lewandowski admired the way that Julian Nagelsmann handled himself when first joining the club — and was astounded at how well the new coach understood his roster. “Not much has changed for me as a striker. Of course, you can’t do much new in terms of tactics in modern football, but a new coach, Julian, with his ideas and his path, we quickly understood what he wanted. When you play at the top level, you know what it means to play with a new line-up or system. It’s nothing new,” Lewandowski said. “Of course, it’s important that the coach says exactly what he wants from us or what he expects - and that is exactly what happened. He said straight away what he’s expecting, what direction we want to go in. We all understood that quickly, wanted to go along with it and just do our thing.” While Nagelsmann might be out for the time being with COVID-19, his presence has still been felt as he has been in constant communication with the players and staff.

Barca wants Olmo badly (Transfer Market Web) FC Barcelona reportedly wants RB Leipzig attacker Dani Olmo in a bad way, but might not have the finances to make a deal happen: The world of football has already echoed that Dani Olmo, Leipzig’s attacking midfielder, is one of the great objectives of FC Barcelona, who wants to take him in the winter market. However, the arrival of the Spanish could be complicated in the face of the winter market, since Leipzig considers him an essential player and would like to have him until the end of the season. Joan Laporta wants to get hold of him at all costs, as he has shown this summer with offers that have reached 75 million euros between fixed and variable. Despite this, let’s not forget that the current situation of the Barça club continues to be precarious and that leaves them in a complicated position. Apparently, RB Leipzig would be willing to consider offers for 60 million euros during the winter market and FC Barcelona is not the only one who has Dani Olmo in their sights, as there are several teams behind him. For what it is worth, it would be absurd if Olmo and Borussia Dortmund stud Erling Haaland both “sold” (Haaland has a release clause) for the same price next summer. Schalke to keep Terodde (Sport1) Schalke 04 feels good about it’s chances to keep Simon Terodde next season: Simon Terodde will most likely stay with the Royal Blues in the next season. Rouven Schröder is optimistic that he will be able to keep the record scorer of the 2nd Bundesliga in Gelsenkirchen in the coming year. “We have made arrangements that Simon will stay with us. That looks good, ”said the sports director of S04 on the future of the 33-year-old. Simon Terodde has long since achieved cult status, especially among fans of the 2nd Bundesliga. In Germany’s second-highest division, the striker scored 153 goals in 263 games for a total of seven clubs, including Union Berlin, VfB Stuttgart and Hamburger SV.

According to rumors coming from Spain, and reported by Fichajes.net, Real Betis would also have fallen on the player, who would like to sign Witsel on a free transfer in view of next season. Dembele to be Newcastle’s first big splash? (Sport1) Could Ousmane Dembele be ready to make the jump to England? If so, Newcastle United might be ready to hand him some stacks: It could be a great transfer: As reported by several English media, Newcastle United is dealing with the signing of Barcelona star Ousmane Dembélé. According to information from Spox and Goal, the attacker might not be averse to a change. The 24-year-old’s contract expires next summer, and talks about an extension have stalled, not least because of the disastrous financial situation at FC Barcelona. If the world champion and his club do not come to an agreement, the offensive player can negotiate freely with other clubs from January. A situation that the Magpies want to take advantage of, because Dembele could earn a lot of money there: around 15 million euros annual salary are in the room, about five million more than at FC Barcelona. Although there should also be an inaugural bonus of 15 million euros in the room, given the transfer free of charge, this should not be a serious problem for the second-bottom of the Premier League. For FC Barcelona, ​​on the other hand, the Dembélé personality could ultimately prove to be a million dollar grave: the Catalans invested a proud 135 million euros in the wing runabout in the summer of 2017. But in four years, the 2018 world champion only scored 30 goals in 118 games across all competitions and missed 96 games due to injury. ICYMI: Bavarian Podcast Works Postgame Show — Bayern 4, Hoffenheim 0 (Bavarian Football Works) Bayern Munich danced their way past Hoffenheim in a fantastic performance; the game was over by the end of the first half as Serge Gnabry and Robert Lewandowski had scored by that time to give Bayern a 2-0 lead. Gnabry has been having a very productive season to date, scoring at a high rate. Lewandowski’s was a screamer which came courtesy of Thomas Müller outmuscling Chris Richards off the ball and setting up the Polish striker.

Of course, you can’t do much new in terms of tactics in modern football, but a new coach, Julian, with his ideas and his path, we quickly understood what he wanted. When you play at the top level, you know what it means to play with a new line-up or system. It’s nothing new,” Lewandowski said. “Of course, it’s important that the coach says exactly what he wants from us or what he expects - and that is exactly what happened. He said straight away what he’s expecting, what direction we want to go in. We all understood that quickly, wanted to go along with it and just do our thing.” While Nagelsmann might be out for the time being with COVID-19, his presence has still been felt as he has been in constant communication with the players and staff.

LexaGene is in the process of completing the necessary work to have the FDA rule on authorizing the MiQLab™ for COVID-19 testing. The FDA is expected to classify the MiQLab as a class II medical device. As such, the process of preparing its point-of-care (POC) fully-automated PCR system, which is comprised of hardware, firmware, software, and chemistry, for evaluation by the FDA, is considerably more complex than if it were simply submitting only a COVID-19 PCR test chemistry for FDA authorization. Dr. Jack Regan, LexaGene’s CEO and Founder stated, “Successfully completing these studies is a big step for LexaGene, as these data could only be collected after we have sufficiently met a number of requirements for system/software verification, electrical safety testing, manufacturing process qualification, quality control, and the associated documentation. It is our belief that the quality of our data will meet FDA expectations. Our next step is to have a third party conduct a COVID-19 clinical evaluation using the MiQLab System at both a POC testing facility and a clinical laboratory, and then the analytical and clinical data will be compiled and submitted to the FDA for authorization.” The following analytical studies were completed using multiple MiQLab Systems: External Quality Control Validation Analytical Sensitivity: Limit of Detection (LoD) Analytical Specificity: Cross-Reactivity Endogenous Interference Substances Studies Carry-over/Cross-Contamination Study Sample Stability Dr. Regan continued, “This milestone should be viewed as having much broader implications than COVID-19 testing only. Our goal is to get our technology through the FDA so that we can leverage the system’s high-quality sample preparation followed by broad-multiplex PCR analysis, which is a combination of features that many currently authorized COVID-19 only testing devices do not have. These features make the MiQLab ideally suited for syndromic testing of complex diseases that can be caused by 10 or more pathogens, such as respiratory diseases (e.g., COVID-19, influenza A & B, RSV, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, etc.), gastro-intestinal diseases, urinary tract diseases, and skin and soft tissue diseases. Preparing our technology to be able to successfully collect the analytical COVID-19 data is arguably the hardest step in the EUA process. If we are successful in being authorized for COVID-19 testing, we will follow this work with studies to support 510(k) applications for complex diseases in human clinical medicine.” LexaGene’s MiQLab system is unique in that it is a flow-through PCR system. To LexaGene’s knowledge, the FDA has never received an application for a flow-through PCR system for use in human clinical diagnostics. It is possible the FDA will require additional studies prior to passing final judgement. Once the required studies are complete, there is no guarantee the FDA will deem the data to be satisfactory for authorization of the system for human clinical diagnostics. Prior to the FDA’s ruling, all data and communications with the FDA are deemed private. Until the FDA grants LexaGene’s system EUA for COVID-19 testing, all work using LexaGene instruments is classified as Research Use Only and cannot be used for human clinical diagnostics.

There are 123 cases in fully vaccinated cases. Vaccination data for COVID-19 patients in hospitals in Ontario are not available on Sundays because some hospitals don't report to the province on weekends.

It was one of the first nations to successfully issue lock-downs, pursue contact tracing, and develop a robust federal infrastructure dedicated towards fighting the spread of the disease. However, this year has been challenging for the country, especially as the infamous Delta variant became more prevalent. India is home to nearly 1.4 billion people. Amidst the immense population, bustling economy, and deeply rooted cultural paradigms that define the nation, there is also a relative respect for health, science, and self-betterment. That is, India has always been an epicenter for healthcare innovation and holistic medicine, in addition to being the modern day mecca for the world’s pharmaceutical needs . But India’s latest milestone is something for the history books: achieving 1 billion vaccinations in less than a year. This means that nearly 75% of the population has received at least one dose of the vaccine, providing incredible hope for the future of the country’s fight against the pandemic. For sake of comparison, in the USA, 66.6% of the population has currently received atleast one dose, and in Canada, 77% of the population has received atleast one dose.

(Photo by Dibyangshu SARKAR / AFP) (Photo by DIBYANGSHU SARKAR/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images But this is an especially monumental feat for India. One of the foremost problems that the nation continues to face is an incredibly large population— an issue which often creates challenges that other countries may take for granted, such as vaccine distribution.

This is why a feat such as achieving 1 billion vaccinations cannot be taken for granted in a place like India—it simply isn’t the same as achieving the same percentage in the USA, or Canada. There are a far different set of intricate nuances to consider. Understanding these nuances brings forth a renewed appreciation for the achievement. Overall, the milestone also perfectly encapsulates India’s dual interests. While cultural norms and deeply historic roots are pervasive throughout Indian culture, there is also a strong commitment towards innovation, science, and preservation of health. India is home to some of the most advanced healthcare innovation, research and development, and medical technologies in the world. It’s the world’s largest vaccine producer (even prior to Covid), and has forged incredible pathways into robotics, telemedicine, and preventative care. And perhaps most importantly with regards to modern healthcare, the government is committed to embracing cutting-edge digital health strategies . Overall, India is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to research and development on multiple fronts, but especially with regards to science and innovation. Time will tell what will happen in the coming months and years with regards to the Covid-19 Coronavirus pandemic. India, like every other country, is not immune to the constant ebbs-and-flows of the virus; just when case counts start to drop, new variants emerge or new outbreaks occur, sending entire countries back into surge protocols. However, with the information that the world has on hand currently, and based on the current knowledge-base and recommendations provided by public health officials, this milestone marks a promising effort by India in its fight against the virus.",https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/0x0/filters%3Aformat%28jpg%29/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/6175b4e21d27fa82b64d1796/0x0.jpg,forbes

Walensky said that the sub-lineage of the highly contagious Delta variant, known as AY.4.2, has been on their radar as it spreads throughout the United Kingdom. “We’re watching it very carefully. We have had a handful of cases here in the United States but it has not taken off as it has in the UK,” Walensky said on NBC’s Meet the Press. But Walensky stressed that it has still yet to be determined whether the new subvariant is more contagious or is resistant to vaccines, despite it being linked to a growing number of cases in the United Kingdom. “It has several mutations on the spike protein that we have not yet seen implicated in increased transmissibility or in a decreased ability of our vaccines or therapeutics to work,” she said. Walensky said she doesn’t anticipate the spread of the new subvariant resulting in a ban on travel from Europe. “We’re not anticipating that now. We are absolutely following the science very very carefully, but we’re not anticipating or looking into that right now,” she said.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/newspress-collage-19906121-1635087882099.png,nypost

Blak...,"NEW YORK (AP) — Andrew Mangiapane scored twice and the Calgary Flames beat the New York Rangers 5-1 on Monday night for their third straight win. Blake Coleman and Mikael Backlund each had a goal and an assist, and Christopher Tanev also scored for Calgary. Johnny Gaudreau got his seventh assist of the season and Jacob Markstrom stopped 28 shots. Dryden Hunt scored for the Rangers, who had won four straight — all on the road. Igor Shesterkin, making his fifth start, finished with 32 saves. Trailing 2-0 after 40 minutes, the Rangers got on the scoreboard early in the third period. Markstrom stopped the initial shot by Jacob Trouba, but Hunt corralled a rebound in front and put it past the goalie for his first of the season at 5:25. Coleman restored Calgary’s two-goal lead less than three minutes later as he backhanded the rebound of his own shot past Shesterkin for his second. Backlund made it 4-1 with 8 1/2 minutes left as he scored into the top left corner from the right circle for his first. Mangiapane got his second of the night, scoring on a rebound on the power play from the right side with just over five seconds remaining. It was his fifth of the season and 10th in his last nine games, dating to last season. Leading 1-0 after one period, the Flames doubled their lead early in the second. Mangiapane intercepted a pass by Patrik Nemeth from behind the Rangers net and beat Shesterkin from the right side at 2:09. Mika Zibanejad had a chance to get the Rangers on the scoreboard after a Flames turnover as he skated up the ice with Alexis Lafreniere, but was denied by Markstorm with about 6 1/2 minutes left in the middle period. Shesterkin made a nice glove stop on a slap shot by Tyler Pitlick about 40 seconds later. Markstrom stopped a wraparound try by Trouba with just more than two minutes to go, and then denied his backhand follow. Calgary outshot New York 15-7 in the first period. Shesterkin’s best save of the period came on an attempt by Sean Monahan in front with 3:15 remaining after a giveaway by the goalie. Tanev got the Flames on the scoreboard on a rush with 1:10 left in the opening period as he got a pass from Gaudreau and beat Shesterkin from the right circle on the glove side for his first of the season. Elias Lindholm got his first assist and seventh point on the play. The Rangers were down two players for much of the first. Rugged forward Ryan Reaves went to the dressing room early in the period after an apparent injury to his left leg, and defenseman Ryan Lindgren joined him by the midpoint after blocking a shot with his foot. Lindgren was back on the bench late in the period, and returned to the ice in the second. Reaves was also on the bench at the start of the second, but did not play again. SPECIAL TEAMS The Rangers went 0 for 2 on the power play and are 3 for 26 this season. … The Flames were 1 for 2 with the man advantage, improving to 3 for 14. LINEUPS Ryan Strome returned to the Rangers’ lineup after missing the four-game road trip due to COVID-19 protocols. He started on a line with Artemi Panarin and Barclay Goodrow. Morgan Barron was sent to Hartford of the AHL to make room for Strome. Injured forward Kappo Kakko is still out and coach Gerard Gallant said Kakko could return Friday.

LINEUPS Ryan Strome returned to the Rangers’ lineup after missing the four-game road trip due to COVID-19 protocols. He started on a line with Artemi Panarin and Barclay Goodrow. Morgan Barron was sent to Hartford of the AHL to make room for Strome. Injured forward Kappo Kakko is still out and coach Gerard Gallant said Kakko could return Friday. Julian Gauthier was also back in the lineup, and Greg McKegg was scratched. With the exception of Markstrom, the Flames used the same lineup as Saturday against Washington.

Pac-12 men’s basketball preview: Can league capitalize on record-setting NCAA Tournament performances?,https://www.deseret.com/2021/10/25/22732726/pac-12-basketball-preview-utah-utes-coach-craig-smith-commissioner-george-kliavkoff-jamie-zaninovich,,['Jay Drew'],,,"UCLA players celebrate after an Elite 8 game against Michigan at Lucas Oil Stadium, Wednesday, March 31, 2021, in Indianapolis. UCLA won 51-49. With all their key contributors returning this season, the Bruins are sure to be a tough out for the Utes and the other Pac-12 teams this season. | Darron Cummings, Associated Press New Runnin’ Utes coach Craig Smith enters a Pac-12 basketball race that is as deep and loaded as ever after impressive NCAA Tournament showing in 2021 SAN FRANCISCO — A razor-close overtime loss to undefeated Gonzaga in a Final Four game. Three teams in the Elite Eight. Four teams in the Sweet 16. Five teams in the Round of 32. A conference-record 13 total wins in the 2021 NCAA Tournament. Add it all up, and it begs the question: What will Pac-12 men’s basketball teams do for an encore in the 2022 Big Dance after the most successful overall showing in conference history last March? “We have great reasons for optimism in the Pac-12,” deputy commissioner and chief operating officer Jamie Zaninovich said at the league’s men’s basketball media day last week at conference headquarters in San Francisco. “The collective commitment to basketball throughout the conference is very important. Our shared objective is to optimize tournament bids and ultimately cut down the nets as national champions.” — Pac-12 commissioner George Kliavkoff The good news for the league is that many of the top players who helped turn the conference’s unexpected success into the story of March Madness last spring are back for more this year. Although only two Pac-12 teams made The Associated Press Top 25 preseason poll released Monday — UCLA is at No. 2 and Oregon is at No. 13 — the league is seemingly gaining more respect with each passing year. Arizona, USC and Colorado received votes, along with BYU, which will play two Pac-12 teams this year — Utah and Oregon. “We are excited about the momentum we have from last season, and confident in the talented student-athletes and great leadership from our coaches,” said new Pac-12 commissioner George Kliavkoff last week. “The collective commitment to basketball throughout the conference is very important. Our shared objective is to optimize tournament bids and ultimately cut down the nets as national champions.” That hasn’t been done since Lute Olson’s Arizona Wildcats won it all in 1997. Into that momentum, and improvement after some lackluster Big Dance showings from 2017-2019, steps new University of Utah coach Craig Smith. The only other new coach is Arizona’s Tommy Lloyd, the former top assistant under Mark Few at Gonzaga. “Certainly, being a part of this amazing conference — the Pac-12, the Conference of Champions, is what they say. Or at least somebody does. To be a part of that is awesome. It is something you want to be a part of, right?,” Smith said, flanked by returnees Branden Carlson and Riley Battin, when it was Utah’s turn to address the media on Oct. 13. “Bring on the competition.” Actually, the league has been trending up since 2020, when up to six teams were expected to get NCAA Tournament bids before the Big Dance was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But few saw the 2021 success coming. In retrospect, every team was probably under-seeded, from Final Four participant UCLA — which upset BYU in a first-round game — to surprise conference tournament champion Oregon State to USC, Colorado and Oregon (which was eliminated by another Pac-12 school, USC). “To finally see the Pac-12 in men’s basketball capture the attention of the basketball world, in March Madness, is truly remarkable and again, a testament to our student-athletes, coaches, administrators, everybody,” Zaninovich said. Some of the league’s NCAA Tournament failures in past years, or unimpressive showings in nonconference games, have been explained away by league officials as the conference having too many one-and-done players leaving early for the NBA. That didn’t happen this offseason, as preseason all-conference selections Johnny Juzang of UCLA, Warith Alatishe of Oregon State, Marcus Bagley of Arizona State and Isaiah Mobley of USC opted to return, “when they had pro opportunities in front of them, but chose to come back to school and invest in their collegiate experience,” Zaninovich said. As it were, the league produced three NBA lottery picks in 2021 — more than any other conference. Four all-freshman team players returned, and will be joined by 10 all-conference transfers, including MAC Player of the Year Marreon Jackson, the former Toledo star who is moving on to Arizona State. Zaninovich said four McDonald’s All-Americans will join the Pac-12 this year, and 12 players from ESPN’s Top 100 recruits list. Smith and Lloyd join a group of coaches who have more than 3,000 wins and 148 years of coaching experience. “The coaching in this league is obviously remarkable,” Zaninovich said. What else does the 2021-22 season hold for the Pac-12? Officials announced that the Pac-12 championship game at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas will tip off in prime time on the East Coast and will be televised by Fox. Also, the Pac-12 will host an NCAA Regional at the Chase Center in San Francisco — the first time in 80 years that San Francisco will host an NCAA Tournament game, the last one having been played at nearby Treasure Island. This will be the second season in which Pac-12 schools will play 20 conference games each. Before that, there will be some huge opportunities for Pac-12 teams to get big national wins. Stanford, Oregon and Arizona State will all get a shot at defending national champion Baylor; Washington and UCLA will play preseason AP No. 1 Gonzaga. Also, Oregon will play in the Maui Invitational and ASU will play in the Battle 4 Atlantis with opportunities to run across top-ranked teams in later rounds. Pac-12 teams will meet power-conference teams at least 20 times, including Utah’s Nov. 20 game against the ACC’s Boston College at the Sunshine Slam in Daytona Beach, Florida. The Runnin’ Utes will also face the SEC’s Missouri on Dec. 18 in Columbia, Missouri, the Big 12’s TCU on Dec. 8 in Fort Worth, Texas, and will host Big 12-bound BYU on Nov. 27 at the Huntsman Center in games that will either add to, or detract from, the league’s improved reputation as a national player. Zaninovich said the league has worked hard to help schools with their nonconference scheduling to figure out what makes the most sense for them. The goal is to have Pac-12 teams win at least 75% of their nonconference games. “We looked at tons of data of the NCAA Tournament, historically, and in most every case, if a conference wins 75% of its nonconference games, at least 50% of their teams advance to the NCAA Tournament,” Zaninovich said. Here’s a closer look at each team’s prospects in 2021-22, in order of how they were selected to finish in the preseason media poll: 1. UCLA Darron Cummings, Associated Press UCLA guard Tyger Campbell, right, celebrates with teammate guard Jaime Jaquez Jr. (4) after an Elite 8 game against Michigan in the NCAA men’s college basketball tournament at Lucas Oil Stadium, in Indianapolis on Wednesday, March 31, 2021. UCLA won 51-49. UCLA is an overwhelming favorite to win the Pac-12 after reaching the Final Four last season. All five starters and every other contributor to the Bruins’ Final Four run returned for coach Mick Cronin, making UCLA an easy pick to win the league. Starters such as Juzang, Tyger Campbell, Jules Bernard, Cody Riley and Jaime Jaquez Jr. will be joined by key newcomers Peyton Watson, Will McClendon and Rutgers transfer Myles Johnson to give the Bruins arguably the best team in the country. “Conference success in our sport is important because of NCAA Tournament bids,” Cronin said at media day. “We are all playing to go to the NCAA Tournament, and getting quality seeds. So conference power, success, all of it, is huge. … I think we proved last year that Pac-12 basketball is powerful.” Juzang and Jaquez said there’s a heightened sense of excitement in Westwood these days, thanks to that tournament run. “We are just as excited as them,” Juzang said. Cronin said the Bruins have “the greatest tradition” in the history of college basketball and feel more pressure to live up to that standard than to repeat last year’s run. 2. Oregon Jeff Roberson, Associated Press Oregon guard Will Richardson drives to the basket ahead of Southern California guard Drew Peterson during Sweet 16 game in the NCAA men’s college basketball tournament at Bankers Life Fieldhouse, Sunday, March 28, 2021, in Indianapolis. Richardson will be back for the Ducks in 2021-22, and is considered one of the better point guards in the league. The Ducks lost quality players Chris Duarte, LJ Figueroa and Eugene Omoruyi, but did well in the transfer portal market, landing Syracuse’s Quincy Guerrier, Oklahoma’s De’Vion Harmon and Jacob Young of Rutgers. They will join one of the Pac-12’s better returning point guards, Will Richardson, to give coach Dana Altman another league championship contender. Former American Fork star Isaac Johnson, a 7-footer, will join the program after having served a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints the past two years. Altman was asked at media day how much longer he will stay in coaching. “I don’t have anything else,” he said. “I am 63. I would like to go on as long as Oregon will have me. … I don’t know what I would do if I didn’t go to the gym every day.” 3. USC (AP Photo/Paul Sancya, Associated Press USC forward Evan Mobley (4) and USC forward Isaiah Mobley (3) watch from the bench during game against Kansas in the second round of the NCAA Tournament at Hinkle Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, Monday, March 22, 2021. While Evan has moved on to the NBA (the No. 3 overall pick in the 2021 NBA draft) Isaiah returns to the Trojans this season. A lot of experts say the Trojans will sorely miss Evan Mobley, the No. 3 pick in July’s NBA draft. They will. But they will also miss reliable guard Tahj Eaddy, the Santa Clara transfer who helped USC eliminate Utah 91-85 in double overtime in the Pac-12 quarterfinals last spring. Coach Andy Enfield does get back Mobley’s brother, Isaiah, and point guard Ethan Anderson and wings Isaiah White and Drew Peterson. Forwards Max Agbonkpolo and Chavez Goodwin also return, which is why USC should make the Big Dance again. “We have a lot of versatilely, but our guards have to be good for us if we hope to get back,” Enfield said.”… The excitement around our program is at an all-time high since I have been here the last eight seasons.” Memphis transfer Boogie Ellis brings his 10.2 scoring average to the team. The coach said the Pac-12’s showing in the tournament “gave our conference a tremendous boost. We were rooting for everyone else as if it were our own program.” T4. Arizona Jeff Chiu, Associated Press Arizona coach Tommy Lloyd waves while speaking during Pac-12 media day Wednesday, Oct. 13, 2021, in San Francisco. Lloyd and Utah’s Craig Smith are the two newcomer coaches to the league this season. Sure, the Wildcats have the winning tradition to fall back on, but this pick from media members who cover the Pac-12 seems high (the Deseret News picked Arizona ninth on its ballot). As mentioned previously, new coach Lloyd saw a lot of winning in more than 20 years at Gonzaga, but Ws don’t figure to come as easily in Tucson for awhile. “I might have to recalibrate what a good winning percentage feels like,” Lloyd said. “I am really looking forward to that journey where every game is going to be a battle.” Lloyd said at Gonzaga if they lost a West Coast Conference game, “it felt like you lost a seed line” for the NCAA Tournament. Bennedict Mathurin, Azuolas Tubelis and Kerr Kriisa stuck around after Sean Miller was fired, and Utah transfer Pelle Larsson should be able to step in and contribute immediately. “We have a great young nucleus to work with,” Lloyd said. T4. Oregon State Amanda Loman, Associated Press Oregon State’s Warith Alatishe shoots over Utah’s Riley Battin during game in Corvallis, Ore., Thursday, Feb. 18, 2021. Much to Oregon State coach Wayne Tinkle’s delight, Alatishe will be back for the Beavers. Before that magical three-weekend stretch in March when they won the Pac-12 Tournament and advanced to the Elite Eight, the Beavers were an average team, perhaps even less than that. Can they recapture that momentum? Coach Wayne Tinkle was able to keep most of his best players — most notably Alatishe, supreme shooter Jarod Lucas and backcourt mate Gianni Hunt. Replacing floor leader Ethan Thompson will be difficult. “This conference is going to be as deep as it has ever been,” Tinkle said, hinting that even though the Beavers have improved, the rest of the league has as well, and duplicating that run will be difficult. 6. Colorado Michael Conroy, Associated Press Colorado forward Evan Battey celebrates during a timeout against Georgetown in NCAA first-round game at Hinkle Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, Saturday, March 20, 2021. Battey will be back for the Buffs in 2021-22. Point guard McKinley Wright IV was a fixture in Boulder the past four years, and will be extremely hard to replace. But coach Tad Boyle said he likes this group, especially if a highly rated incoming freshman class contributes. The Buffs’ best returners are big man Evan Battey, forward Jabari Walker and guard Eli Parquet, who helped CU go 14-6 in league play and earn a No., 5 seed in the NCAA Tournament. Colorado reached the Round of 32 and was the only Pac-12 entrant that didn’t win two or more contests in March Madness. “We are in great shape leadership-wise, but we gotta grow up quickly,” Boyle said. 7. Arizona State Rick Scuteri, Associated Press Arizona State coach Bobby Hurley talks to Marcus Bagley during game against Arizona, Thursday, Jan. 21, 2021, in Tempe, Ariz. Convincing Bagley to return was a big win for the ASU coach. Coach Bobby Hurley scored two major wins in the offseason, getting talented forward Bagley to stick around for at least another year and luring MAC Player of the Year Marreon Jackson of Toledo to Tempe. Jackson, who averaged 18.1 points, 6.1 rebounds and 5.9 assists for the Rockets last year, will team with Ohio State transfer Luther Muhammad and Boston College transfer Jay Heath and returnees Bagley, Kimani Lawrence and Enoch Boakye to give Hurley plenty of talent with which to work. After ASU went 11-14 last year, 7-10 in the Pac-12, Hurley said watching fellow conference mates succeed in the tournament was invigorating. “I was so happy for the league, and for those colleagues, those coaches,” he said. Bagley, a 6-foot-8 sophomore, said his decision to return was “based on knowing how much better I could be.” 8. Washington State Pete Caster, Associated Press Washington State head coach Kyle Smith reacts after a foul was called during game against Stanford, Saturday, Feb. 20, 2021, in Pullman, Wash. Slowly but surely, Smith is bringing respectability to the Cougars program. The Cougars are a popular pick among some to make the NCAA Tournament for the first time in awhile, because coach Kyle Smith is slowly building something in Pullman. Wazzu returns its main rotation — led by Efe Abogidi, Dishon Jackson and Noah Williams — and should be bolstered by South Alabama transfer Michael Flowers (21.0 ppg.) and UC San Diego transfer Tyrell Roberts (19.2 ppg.), who joined Abogidi and Smith at media day. “He’s a bucket,” Smith said of the 5-11 Roberts. Having gone 7-12 in league play last year, the Cougars will hang their hat on defense once again, Smith said. “I think our talent is there,” he said. “Experience is still lacking, we are still quite youthful.” 9. Stanford David Zalubowski, Associated Press Stanford forward Jaiden Delaire, left, drives during game against Colorado Saturday, Jan. 16, 2021, in Boulder, Colo. Delaire will be among the Cardinal players trying to keep Stanford coach Jerod Haase on the sidelines this season. While Utah coach Larry Krystkowiak was clearly on the hot seat last year, and ended up losing his job, the Pac-12 coach who wears that description this year is Stanford’s Jerod Haase, along with Washington’s Mike Hopkins, perhaps. The Cardinal lost a lot, most notably Oscar da Silva, Zaire Williams and Daejon Davis, and will do well to make the tournament for the first time since 2014. Senior Jaiden Delaire, junior Spencer Jones and five-star recruit Harrison Ingram will attempt to help Haase keep his job. “Our goal is to simple — it is to be awesome,” Haase said. That might be what it takes to keep the sixth-year coach in Palo Alto for another year. 10. Utah Jeff Chiu, Associated Press Utah coach Craig Smith, left, speaks next to Riley Battin, middle, and Branden Carlson during Pac-12 media day Wednesday, Oct. 13, 2021, in San Francisco. While expectations for the Utes are not high in Smith’s first year at the helm, the players said at media day that the Utes will surprise some people in 2021-22. For the record, the Deseret News picked the Utes to finish seventh. The mass exodus since Krystkowiak was fired on March 16 has been well-documented, but Smith was able to keep Carlson and Battin in the fold (after Battin briefly entered the transfer portal) and those two said at media day that the Runnin’ Utes will surprise some people in 2021-22. “I will say this: We have gotten a lot better in a short amount of time, and I can’t wait to see where this team goes,” Smith said at media day. The feeling here is that UNLV grad transfer David Jenkins Jr. will give the Utes a nice scoring lift, and Utah State transfers Marco Anthony and Rollie Worster will add some defensive toughness that was lacking last year. “There is a lot of depth in our backcourt,” Smith said. “The words that describe our backcourt are selfless and skilled. They can shoot it, they can pass it, they can dribble it, and for the most part we are pretty tough defensively with a good feel for the game.” 11. Washington Ted S. Warren, Associated Press California guard Jarred Hyder (3) is defended by Washington forward Nate Roberts (1) as guards Jamal Bey (5) and Marcus Tsohonis (0) watch during game Saturday, Feb. 20, 2021, in Seattle. The Huskies went 15-3 in Pac-12 play in 2018-19, but have been a disaster since then, going 9-29 in league play since. The aforementioned Hopkins seemingly needs a big turnaround to keep his job. Starters Jamal Bey and Nate Roberts return, but most of the other expected contributors are transfers — guys such as Terrell Brown Jr. (Arizona), Daejon Davis (Stanford) and Emmitt Mathews Jr. (West Virginia). “We took advantage of the transfer portal,” Hopkins said. 12. California Jeff Chiu, Associated Press California forward Andre Kelly shoots against Oregon during game in Berkeley, Calif., Saturday, Feb. 27, 2021. Kelly is the Bears’ leading returning scorer. Coach Mark Fox’s best player last year, former Wasatch Academy star Matt Bradley, has transferred to San Diego State. He will be missed. Andre Kelly (10.3 ppg.) and Grant Anticevich (8.9 ppg.) are back, and are joined by Charlotte transfer Jordan Shepherd. The Bears will play at UNLV on Nov. 13 in what should be a barometer game; they will also play Florida in the Rocket Mortgage Fort Myers Tip-Off and either Ohio State or Seton Hall in the second round. “We have a nonconference schedule that is going to help us play in the best conference in America,” Fox said.",2021-10-25 16:15:22,"SAN FRANCISCO — A razor-close overtime loss to undefeated Gonzaga in a Final Four game. Three teams in the Elite Eight. Four teams in the Sweet 16. Five teams in the Round of 32. A conference-record 13 total wins in the 2021 NCAA Tournament. Add it all up, and it begs the question: What will Pac-12 men’s basketball teams do for an encore in the 2022 Big Dance after the most successful overall showing in conference history last March? “We have great reasons for optimism in the Pac-12,” deputy commissioner and chief operating officer Jamie Zaninovich said at the league’s men’s basketball media day last week at conference headquarters in San Francisco. “The collective commitment to basketball throughout the conference is very important.

Arizona Arizona coach Tommy Lloyd waves while speaking during Pac-12 media day Wednesday, Oct. 13, 2021, in San Francisco. Lloyd and Utah’s Craig Smith are the two newcomer coaches to the league this season. Jeff Chiu, Associated Press Sure, the Wildcats have the winning tradition to fall back on, but this pick from media members who cover the Pac-12 seems high (the Deseret News picked Arizona ninth on its ballot). As mentioned previously, new coach Lloyd saw a lot of winning in more than 20 years at Gonzaga, but Ws don’t figure to come as easily in Tucson for awhile. “I might have to recalibrate what a good winning percentage feels like,” Lloyd said. “I am really looking forward to that journey where every game is going to be a battle.” Lloyd said at Gonzaga if they lost a West Coast Conference game, “it felt like you lost a seed line” for the NCAA Tournament. Bennedict Mathurin, Azuolas Tubelis and Kerr Kriisa stuck around after Sean Miller was fired, and Utah transfer Pelle Larsson should be able to step in and contribute immediately. “We have a great young nucleus to work with,” Lloyd said. T4. Oregon State Oregon State’s Warith Alatishe shoots over Utah’s Riley Battin during game in Corvallis, Ore., Thursday, Feb. 18, 2021. Much to Oregon State coach Wayne Tinkle’s delight, Alatishe will be back for the Beavers. Amanda Loman, Associated Press Before that magical three-weekend stretch in March when they won the Pac-12 Tournament and advanced to the Elite Eight, the Beavers were an average team, perhaps even less than that. Can they recapture that momentum? Coach Wayne Tinkle was able to keep most of his best players — most notably Alatishe, supreme shooter Jarod Lucas and backcourt mate Gianni Hunt. Replacing floor leader Ethan Thompson will be difficult. “This conference is going to be as deep as it has ever been,” Tinkle said, hinting that even though the Beavers have improved, the rest of the league has as well, and duplicating that run will be difficult. 6. Colorado Colorado forward Evan Battey celebrates during a timeout against Georgetown in NCAA first-round game at Hinkle Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, Saturday, March 20, 2021. Battey will be back for the Buffs in 2021-22. Michael Conroy, Associated Press Point guard McKinley Wright IV was a fixture in Boulder the past four years, and will be extremely hard to replace. But coach Tad Boyle said he likes this group, especially if a highly rated incoming freshman class contributes. The Buffs’ best returners are big man Evan Battey, forward Jabari Walker and guard Eli Parquet, who helped CU go 14-6 in league play and earn a No., 5 seed in the NCAA Tournament. Colorado reached the Round of 32 and was the only Pac-12 entrant that didn’t win two or more contests in March Madness. “We are in great shape leadership-wise, but we gotta grow up quickly,” Boyle said. 7. Arizona State Arizona State coach Bobby Hurley talks to Marcus Bagley during game against Arizona, Thursday, Jan. 21, 2021, in Tempe, Ariz. Convincing Bagley to return was a big win for the ASU coach. Rick Scuteri, Associated Press Coach Bobby Hurley scored two major wins in the offseason, getting talented forward Bagley to stick around for at least another year and luring MAC Player of the Year Marreon Jackson of Toledo to Tempe. Jackson, who averaged 18.1 points, 6.1 rebounds and 5.9 assists for the Rockets last year, will team with Ohio State transfer Luther Muhammad and Boston College transfer Jay Heath and returnees Bagley, Kimani Lawrence and Enoch Boakye to give Hurley plenty of talent with which to work. After ASU went 11-14 last year, 7-10 in the Pac-12, Hurley said watching fellow conference mates succeed in the tournament was invigorating. “I was so happy for the league, and for those colleagues, those coaches,” he said. Bagley, a 6-foot-8 sophomore, said his decision to return was “based on knowing how much better I could be.” 8. Washington State Washington State head coach Kyle Smith reacts after a foul was called during game against Stanford, Saturday, Feb. 20, 2021, in Pullman, Wash. Slowly but surely, Smith is bringing respectability to the Cougars program. Pete Caster, Associated Press The Cougars are a popular pick among some to make the NCAA Tournament for the first time in awhile, because coach Kyle Smith is slowly building something in Pullman. Wazzu returns its main rotation — led by Efe Abogidi, Dishon Jackson and Noah Williams — and should be bolstered by South Alabama transfer Michael Flowers (21.0 ppg.) and UC San Diego transfer Tyrell Roberts (19.2 ppg.), who joined Abogidi and Smith at media day. “He’s a bucket,” Smith said of the 5-11 Roberts. Having gone 7-12 in league play last year, the Cougars will hang their hat on defense once again, Smith said. “I think our talent is there,” he said. “Experience is still lacking, we are still quite youthful.” 9. Stanford Stanford forward Jaiden Delaire, left, drives during game against Colorado Saturday, Jan. 16, 2021, in Boulder, Colo. Delaire will be among the Cardinal players trying to keep Stanford coach Jerod Haase on the sidelines this season. David Zalubowski, Associated Press While Utah coach Larry Krystkowiak was clearly on the hot seat last year, and ended up losing his job, the Pac-12 coach who wears that description this year is Stanford’s Jerod Haase, along with Washington’s Mike Hopkins, perhaps. The Cardinal lost a lot, most notably Oscar da Silva, Zaire Williams and Daejon Davis, and will do well to make the tournament for the first time since 2014. Senior Jaiden Delaire, junior Spencer Jones and five-star recruit Harrison Ingram will attempt to help Haase keep his job. “Our goal is to simple — it is to be awesome,” Haase said. That might be what it takes to keep the sixth-year coach in Palo Alto for another year. 10. Utah Utah coach Craig Smith, left, speaks next to Riley Battin, middle, and Branden Carlson during Pac-12 media day Wednesday, Oct. 13, 2021, in San Francisco. While expectations for the Utes are not high in Smith’s first year at the helm, the players said at media day that the Utes will surprise some people in 2021-22. Jeff Chiu, Associated Press For the record, the Deseret News picked the Utes to finish seventh. The mass exodus since Krystkowiak was fired on March 16 has been well-documented, but Smith was able to keep Carlson and Battin in the fold (after Battin briefly entered the transfer portal) and those two said at media day that the Runnin’ Utes will surprise some people in 2021-22. “I will say this: We have gotten a lot better in a short amount of time, and I can’t wait to see where this team goes,” Smith said at media day. The feeling here is that UNLV grad transfer David Jenkins Jr. will give the Utes a nice scoring lift, and Utah State transfers Marco Anthony and Rollie Worster will add some defensive toughness that was lacking last year. “There is a lot of depth in our backcourt,” Smith said. “The words that describe our backcourt are selfless and skilled. They can shoot it, they can pass it, they can dribble it, and for the most part we are pretty tough defensively with a good feel for the game.” 11. Washington California guard Jarred Hyder (3) is defended by Washington forward Nate Roberts (1) as guards Jamal Bey (5) and Marcus Tsohonis (0) watch during game Saturday, Feb. 20, 2021, in Seattle. Ted S. Warren, Associated Press The Huskies went 15-3 in Pac-12 play in 2018-19, but have been a disaster since then, going 9-29 in league play since. The aforementioned Hopkins seemingly needs a big turnaround to keep his job. Starters Jamal Bey and Nate Roberts return, but most of the other expected contributors are transfers — guys such as Terrell Brown Jr. (Arizona), Daejon Davis (Stanford) and Emmitt Mathews Jr. (West Virginia). “We took advantage of the transfer portal,” Hopkins said. 12. California California forward Andre Kelly shoots against Oregon during game in Berkeley, Calif., Saturday, Feb. 27, 2021. Kelly is the Bears’ leading returning scorer. Jeff Chiu, Associated Press Coach Mark Fox’s best player last year, former Wasatch Academy star Matt Bradley, has transferred to San Diego State. He will be missed. Andre Kelly (10.3 ppg.) and Grant Anticevich (8.9 ppg.) are back, and are joined by Charlotte transfer Jordan Shepherd. The Bears will play at UNLV on Nov. 13 in what should be a barometer game; they will also play Florida in the Rocket Mortgage Fort Myers Tip-Off and either Ohio State or Seton Hall in the second round. “We have a nonconference schedule that is going to help us play in the best conference in America,” Fox said.

(AP Photo/Anupam Nath) | ASSOCIATED PRESS The mortality caused by a deadly pathogen is partly a reflection of the social and political order it attacks Never in our lifetimes, it seems, has there been greater uncertainty about the future — and greater ignorance of the past. At the beginning of 2020, very few people grasped the significance of the news coming out of Wuhan about a new coronavirus. When I first spoke and wrote publicly about the rising probability of a global pandemic, in the week ending Jan. 26, 2020, I was regarded as eccentric (certainly by the majority of the delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos, who seemed oblivious to the danger). The conventional wisdom at that time, from Fox News to The Washington Post, was that the coronavirus posed a lesser threat to Americans than the usual winter wave of influenza. On Feb. 2, I wrote, “We are now dealing with an epidemic in the world’s most populous country, which has a significant chance of becoming a global pandemic. ... The challenge is ... to resist that strange fatalism that leads most of us not to cancel our travel plans and not to wear uncomfortable masks, even when a dangerous virus is spreading exponentially.” Looking back, I read those sentences as a veiled confession. I was traveling manically in January and February, as I had done for most of the previous 20 years. In January, I flew from London to Dallas, from Dallas to San Francisco, and from there to Hong Kong (Jan. 8), Taipei (Jan. 10), Singapore (Jan. 13), Zurich (Jan. 19), back to San Francisco (Jan. 24), and then to Fort Lauderdale (Jan. 27). I wore a mask once or twice but found it intolerable after an hour and took it off. In the course of February, I flew almost as frequently, though not so far: to New York, Sun Valley, Bozeman, Washington and Lyford Cay in the Bahamas. You may wonder what kind of life that was. I used to joke that the lecture circuit had turned me into an “international man of history.” I realized only later that I might have been one of the “superspreaders” whose hyperactive travel schedules were spreading the virus from Asia to the rest of the world. My weekly newspaper column in the first half of 2020 became a kind of plague diary, though I never mentioned the fact that I was ill for most of February, with a painful cough I could not shake off. (To get through lectures, I relied heavily on the alternative medicine that some call Scotch.) “Worry about grandparents,” I wrote on Feb. 29; “the mortality rate for people in their eighties is above 14%, whereas it’s close to zero for those under 40.” I omitted the less comforting data on asthmatic men in their mid-50s. I also left out the fact that I went to see a doctor twice only to be told that — as more or less everywhere in the United States at that time — there were no tests available for COVID-19. All I knew was that it was serious, and not only for me and my family. As I wrote on March 1: “Those who blithely say, ‘This is no worse than the flu’ ... are missing the point. ... Uncertainty surrounds it because it is so difficult to detect in its early stages, when many carriers are both infectious and asymptomatic. We don’t know for sure how many people have it, so we don’t exactly know its reproduction number and its mortality rate. There’s no vaccine and there’s no cure.” In another article, published in The Wall Street Journal on March 8, I wrote, “If the U.S. turns out to have proportionately as many cases as South Korea, it will soon have some 46,000 cases and more than 300 deaths — or 1,200 deaths if the U.S. mortality rate is as high as Italy’s.” At that point, total confirmed cases in the U.S. stood at just 541; deaths at 22. We passed 46,000 cases on March 24 and 1,200 deaths on March 25, just over two weeks later. On March 15, I noted, “John F. Kennedy airport was thronged yesterday with people doing what, since time immemorial, they have done in times of plague: fleeing the big city (and spreading the virus). ... We are entering the panic phase of the pandemic.” That was the same day I myself flew, with my wife and my two youngest children, from California to Montana. We stayed there for a year. I wrote and thought about little else in the first half of 2020. Why this intense preoccupation? The answer is that, although my core competency is financial history, I have been keenly interested in the role of disease in history ever since studying the Hamburg cholera epidemic of 1892 as a graduate student more than 30 years ago. Richard Evans’ meticulously detailed study of that episode introduced me to the idea that the mortality caused by a deadly pathogen is partly a reflection of the social and political order it attacks. It was the class structure as much as the bacterium Vibrio cholerae that killed people in Hamburg, Germany, Evans argued, because the entrenched power of the city’s property owners had been an insuperable obstacle to improving the city’s antiquated water and sewage systems. The mortality rate for the poor was 13 times higher than for the rich. Researching “The Pity of War” a few years later, I was struck by statistics that suggested the German army had collapsed in 1918 partly because of a surge of illness, possibly resulting from the Spanish influenza pandemic. “The War of the World” (Penguin, 2006) delved more deeply into the history of the 1918-19 pandemic, showing how the First World War ended with twin pandemics — not only influenza but also the ideological contagion of Bolshevism. The work I did on empires in the 2000s also involved excursions into the history of contagious disease. No account of European settlement in the New World could have omitted the role that disease played in “thinning the Indians, to make room for the English,” as John Archdale, the governor of Carolina in the 1690s, callously remarked. (The title of the second chapter of my book “Empire” was “White Plague.”) I was also very struck by the terrible toll of tropical disease on British soldiers stationed far from home: A man’s chances of surviving a tour of duty in Sierra Leone were pitifully low — 1 in 2. “The Great Degeneration” (Penguin, 2014) explicitly warned of our growing vulnerability to “the ... random mutation of viruses like influenza,” while “The Square and the Tower” (Penguin, 2017) was essentially a history of the world based on the insight that “network structures are as important as viruses in determining the speed and extent of a contagion.” The COVID-19 pandemic is far from over. The death toll worldwide approaches five million, which is certainly an underestimate, as the statistics from a number of large countries (notably Iran and Russia) cannot be trusted. And the cumulative body count continues to rise globally — to say nothing of the number of people whose health has been permanently damaged, which no one has yet estimated. It seems increasingly likely that Lord Martin Rees, Britain’s astronomer royal, has won his bet with the Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker that “bioterror or bioerror will lead to one million casualties in a single event within a six month period starting no later than Dec 31 2020.” Some epidemiologists have argued that, without drastic social distancing and economic lockdowns, the ultimate death toll could have been between 30 million and 40 million. Because of government restrictions and changes in public behavior, it will surely not be as high. ASSOCIATED PRESS Cemetery workers lower the coffin of a COVID-19 victim into his grave at the Vila Formosa cemetery in Sao Paulo, Brazil, late Wednesday, March 31, 2021. Because of the increased number of deaths in the city, the burial service in some public cemeteries has been extended to the hours of the night. (AP Photo/Nelson Antoine) Yet precisely these “nonpharmaceutical interventions” have inflicted a shock on the world economy far greater than that caused by the 2008-09 financial crisis — potentially as great as the shock of the Great Depression, but compressed into months, not years. Governments had to take drastic fiscal measures to stave off a collapse of the markets. You see, disasters and their impact are rarely entirely exogenous events, with the exception of a massive meteor strike, which hasn’t happened in 66 million years, or an alien invasion, which hasn’t happened at all. Even a catastrophic earthquake is only as catastrophic as the extent of urbanization along the fault line — or the shoreline, if it triggers a tsunami. A pandemic is made up of a new pathogen and the social networks that it attacks. We cannot understand the scale of the contagion by studying only the virus itself, because the virus will infect only as many people as social networks allow it to. At the same time, a catastrophe lays bare the societies and states that it strikes. It is a moment of truth, of revelation, exposing some as fragile, others as resilient, and others as “antifragile” — able not just to withstand disaster but to be strengthened by it. We still find ourselves in the middle of this pandemic, about which it’s hard to gain the perspective that hindsight affords. But looking at past pandemics and disasters not only helps provide perspective on the current one, but also allow us to understand and prepare for the inevitability of the next one. So cometh now My Lady Influenza, like a star Inebriously wan, and in her train Fever, the haggard soul’s white nenuphur, And lily-fingered Death, and grisly Pain And Constipation who makes all things vain, Pneumonyer, Cancer, and Nasal Catarrh. Rupert Brooke’s “To My Lady Influenza” (1906) was a facetious undergraduate work. Yet “Lady Influenza” was never to be trifled with. The first well-described influenza outbreaks were in 16th-century Europe, but the earliest was probably in 1173. There had been significant influenza pandemics in the 18th and 19th centuries, but the 20th century was to be hit much harder. A more populous world was also a more urban world and a more mobile world — a world in which low air quality in industrial towns may have made people more susceptible to respiratory illnesses. A year after Brooke wrote “To My Lady Influenza,” his eldest brother, Dick, died of pneumonia at the age of 26. Brooke himself would live only a year longer, dying of an infected mosquito bite that led to sepsis, off the Greek island of Skyros. A predictable “gray rhino,” in the sense that danger of a general European war was well known, but also a surprising “black swan,” in the sense that contemporaries seemed bewildered by its outbreak, the First World War was a true dragon-king event in terms of its vast historical consequences. As disastrous as the war was, its proximate impact in terms of lives lost was exceeded by that of the influenza pandemic that broke out in its final year. Where exactly the new strain of H1N1 first appeared is uncertain, but it is usually said to have been Fort Riley, Kansas, the site of Camp Funston, one of the network of Army camps where hundreds of thousands of young American men were being trained to fight in Europe as the American Expeditionary Forces. There is, however, evidence that the pandemic originated in the British Army in 1917, though the condition was initially identified as “purulent bronchitis with bronchopneumonia.” Here was the key to influenza’s 20th-century success. Never had armies been mobilized on such a scale before — more than 70 million men in uniform. Never had so many young men been taken from their homes and workplaces, crowded into primitive accommodations, and sent over long distances in ships and trains. The idea that the virus originated in pigs has been refuted (an avian origin seems more likely); if anything, the direction of infection was from men to pigs. The first American cases were recorded at Camp Funston on March 4. A week later, a member of Fort Riley’s catering staff entered the infirmary, followed in the coming days by a stream of infected soldiers. By the end of the month, more than a thousand cases had been recorded and 48 men had died of influenza. As if to mock the efforts of men to kill one another, the virus spread rapidly across the United States and then crossed to Europe on the jam-packed American troopships. It is possible that the pandemic explains the near doubling of the proportion of German soldiers reporting sick in the summer of 1918, which was a crucial factor in the imperial army’s subsequent collapse. Certainly, we have reports of German prisoners of war with the flu from July. By that time it had reached India, Australia and New Zealand. A few months later, a second and deadlier wave struck all but simultaneously in Brest, France; Freetown, Sierra Leone; and Boston. The virus made a new landfall in the United States at Boston’s Commonwealth Pier on Aug. 27, 1918, when three cases of influenza appeared on the sick list. Eight cases emerged the next day, and 58 the next, 15 of whom were so ill they were transferred to the U.S. Naval Hospital in Chelsea. On Sept. 8, influenza arrived at the Army’s Camp Devens. Within 10 days, thousands of feverish patients overwhelmed the camp’s hospitals; within weeks, the morgue was full of blue-tinged, asphyxiated corpses. Combatant countries sought to suppress the news of the pandemic as potentially harmful to wartime morale; this hardly helped to keep the public informed. The disease came to be known as the Spanish flu because only the largely uncensored press of neutral Spain reported on it with any accuracy. Between 40 million and 50 million people died as a result of the pandemic, the majority of them suffocated by a lethal accumulation of blood and other fluid in the lungs. The absolute numbers were highest in India (18.5 million deaths) and China (between 4 million and 9.5 million), but death rates varied widely from place to place. Close to half (44.5%) of the population of Cameroon was wiped out; in Western Samoa, nearly a quarter (23.6%). The worst mortality rates in Europe were in Hungary and Spain (each around 1.2%), with Italy not far behind. By contrast, North America got off lightly: between 0.53% and 0.65% for the United States, 0.61% for Canada. As these figures imply, the Spanish flu was indifferent as to a country’s combatant status. While its initial spread may have been related to wartime accommodation and transportation, that soon ceased to be true. In the United States, the deaths of as many as 675,000 people were attributed to the Spanish flu, of which 550,000 were excess deaths (above what would have been expected in that period under normal circumstances). Equivalent mortality in 2020 would have been between 1.8 million and 2.2 million Americans. The Spanish flu killed an order of magnitude more Americans than died in combat in the war (53,402). Ironically, unlike most flu epidemics, but like the war that preceded and spread it, the influenza of 1918 disproportionately killed young adults. Out of 272,500 male influenza deaths in the United States, nearly 49% were aged 20 to 39, whereas only 18% were under five and 13% were over 50. The very young and very old were also (as usual) vulnerable, so that all countries for which age-specific death rates are available recorded a roughly W-shaped age distribution of mortality. Death was not caused by the influenza virus itself so much as by the body’s immunological reaction to the virus. Perversely, this meant that individuals with the strongest immune systems were more likely to die than those with weaker immune systems. A good illustration of the impact of the pandemic on young adults, as well as a vivid description of the hallucinogenic miseries of the illness itself, can be found in Katherine Anne Porter’s short story “Pale Horse, Pale Rider” (1937), about a wartime romance cut cruelly short by the virus. In Sept. 2021, COVID-19’s American death toll overtook that of the 1918 flu. And yet, in Aug. 2020, it appeared that, with a regime of mass testing, contact tracing, social distancing and targeted quarantining, a country could contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2, as the virus relied heavily on superspreaders for its transmission and disproportionately sickened or killed people past retirement age. Only in the spring of 2021 did it join the elite of pandemics — the 20 or so in recorded history that killed upward of 0.05% of humanity. Only a handful of those nations that fought World War II have lost more people per day to COVID-19 than they have lost to the Axis powers. The United States is one of those countries. This illustrates something profound — that all disasters are at some level man-made political disasters, even if they originate with new pathogens. Politics explained why World War II killed 25 times as many Germans as Americans. Politics also helps to explain why COVID-19 has thus far killed more than eight times as many Americans as Germans. ASSOCIATED PRESS The fiancee of a person who died of COVID-19 breaks down during cremation in Gauhati, India, Tuesday, April 27, 2021. Coronavirus cases in India are surging faster than anywhere else in the world. (AP Photo/Anupam Nath) This plague began as a gray rhino, predicted by many. It struck as a black swan, somehow completely unforeseen. Could it become a world-changing “dragon king”? As we have seen, disasters of any kind become truly epoch-making events only if their economic, social and political ramifications amount to more than the excess mortality they cause. Could this medium-size disaster nevertheless alter our lives permanently and profoundly? Let me now hazard three guesses. First, COVID-19 will be to social life what AIDS was to sexual life: It will change our behavior, though by no means enough to avert a significant number of premature deaths. I myself welcome a new age of social distancing, but then I am a natural misanthrope who hates crowds and will not greatly miss hugs and handshakes. Most people, however, will be unable to resist the temptations of post-lockdown gregariousness. There will be unsafe socializing just as there still is unsafe sex, even after more than three decades and 30 million deaths from HIV. Second, and for that reason, most big cities are not “over.” Do we all now head from Gotham or the Great Wen to the villages, there to cultivate our vegetable gardens in splendid, rustic isolation? Do nearly half of us continue to work from home, as we did during the pandemic — more than three times more than before? Probably not. It takes a lot to kill a city. True, just over a century after Thomas Mann wrote “Death in Venice” (1912), Venice is pretty much dead. But it was not cholera that killed it — it was the shifting pattern of international trade. Likewise, COVID-19 will not kill London or New York; it will just make them cheaper, grungier and younger. Some billionaires will not return. Some firms and many families will move to the suburbs or even farther afield. Tax revenues will drop. Crime rates will jump. As Gerald Ford supposedly did in 1975, when the city asked for a federal bailout, another president may tell New York to “drop dead.” San Francisco will lose talent to Austin. But inertia is a powerful thing. Americans these days relocate less than they used to. Only a third of jobs can really be done at home; everyone else will still need to work in offices, shops and factories. Workplaces will just be different — more spacious and campus-like, as they already are in Silicon Valley. Commuting will no longer involve being packed like sardines on a subway. No more unwelcome intimacies on elevators. Masks over most faces. No more tut-tutting at the hijab and the niqab. Perforce, we are all modest now. What of the pandemic’s impact on the generational imbalances that had grown so intolerable in many societies by 2020? Was COVID-19 sent by Freya, the goddess of youth, to emancipate millennials and Generation Z from bearing the fiscal burden of an excessive number of elderly people? It is tempting to marvel at this ageist virus. No previous pandemic was so discriminating against the elderly and in favor of the young. But in truth, the impact of COVID-19 in terms of excess mortality will probably not be great enough to balance the intergenerational accounts. In the short run, the majority of old people will remain retired; relatively few will die prematurely — hardly any in the most elderly of countries, Japan. The young, meanwhile, will be the ones struggling to find jobs (other than with Amazon) and struggling almost as much to have fun. An economy without crowds is not a “new normal.” It may be more like the new anomie, to borrow Émile Durkheim’s term for the sense of disconnectedness he associated with modernity. For most young people, the word “fun” is almost synonymous with “crowd.” The era of distancing will be a time of depression in the psychological as well as the economic sense. The gloom has been especially deep for Generation Z, whose university social lives — half the point of college, if not more — were wrecked. They spent yet more time on electronic devices — perhaps an hour a day more than before the pandemic. It did not make them happier. History tells us to expect the great punctuation marks of disaster in no predictable order. The four horsemen of the Book of Revelation — Conquest, War, Famine and the pale rider Death — gallop out at seemingly random intervals to remind us that no amount of technological innovation can make mankind invulnerable. Indeed, some innovations — like those fleets of jet airplanes that transported so many infected people from Wuhan to the rest of the world in Jan. 2020 — give the horsemen the opportunity to ride in their slipstream. Yet somehow the riders’ arrival always takes us by surprise. For a moment, we contemplate the scenario of total extinction. We shelter in place, watching “Contagion” or reading Atwood. Perhaps the black swan becomes a dragon king and turns life upside down. But very rarely.

At the beginning of 2020, very few people grasped the significance of the news coming out of Wuhan about a new coronavirus. When I first spoke and wrote publicly about the rising probability of a global pandemic, in the week ending Jan. 26, 2020, I was regarded as eccentric (certainly by the majority of the delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos, who seemed oblivious to the danger). The conventional wisdom at that time, from Fox News to The Washington Post, was that the coronavirus posed a lesser threat to Americans than the usual winter wave of influenza. On Feb. 2, I wrote, “We are now dealing with an epidemic in the world’s most populous country, which has a significant chance of becoming a global pandemic. ... The challenge is ... to resist that strange fatalism that leads most of us not to cancel our travel plans and not to wear uncomfortable masks, even when a dangerous virus is spreading exponentially.” Looking back, I read those sentences as a veiled confession. Related Is there hope for the family after the pandemic? Or will the battle of the sexes rage on? The river is round I was traveling manically in January and February, as I had done for most of the previous 20 years. In January, I flew from London to Dallas, from Dallas to San Francisco, and from there to Hong Kong (Jan. 8), Taipei (Jan. 10), Singapore (Jan. 13), Zurich (Jan. 19), back to San Francisco (Jan. 24), and then to Fort Lauderdale (Jan. 27). I wore a mask once or twice but found it intolerable after an hour and took it off. In the course of February, I flew almost as frequently, though not so far: to New York, Sun Valley, Bozeman, Washington and Lyford Cay in the Bahamas. You may wonder what kind of life that was. I used to joke that the lecture circuit had turned me into an “international man of history.” I realized only later that I might have been one of the “superspreaders” whose hyperactive travel schedules were spreading the virus from Asia to the rest of the world. My weekly newspaper column in the first half of 2020 became a kind of plague diary, though I never mentioned the fact that I was ill for most of February, with a painful cough I could not shake off. (To get through lectures, I relied heavily on the alternative medicine that some call Scotch.) “Worry about grandparents,” I wrote on Feb. 29; “the mortality rate for people in their eighties is above 14%, whereas it’s close to zero for those under 40.” I omitted the less comforting data on asthmatic men in their mid-50s. I also left out the fact that I went to see a doctor twice only to be told that — as more or less everywhere in the United States at that time — there were no tests available for COVID-19. All I knew was that it was serious, and not only for me and my family. As I wrote on March 1: “Those who blithely say, ‘This is no worse than the flu’ ... are missing the point. ... Uncertainty surrounds it because it is so difficult to detect in its early stages, when many carriers are both infectious and asymptomatic. We don’t know for sure how many people have it, so we don’t exactly know its reproduction number and its mortality rate. There’s no vaccine and there’s no cure.” In another article, published in The Wall Street Journal on March 8, I wrote, “If the U.S. turns out to have proportionately as many cases as South Korea, it will soon have some 46,000 cases and more than 300 deaths — or 1,200 deaths if the U.S. mortality rate is as high as Italy’s.” At that point, total confirmed cases in the U.S. stood at just 541; deaths at 22. We passed 46,000 cases on March 24 and 1,200 deaths on March 25, just over two weeks later. On March 15, I noted, “John F. Kennedy airport was thronged yesterday with people doing what, since time immemorial, they have done in times of plague: fleeing the big city (and spreading the virus). ... We are entering the panic phase of the pandemic.” That was the same day I myself flew, with my wife and my two youngest children, from California to Montana. We stayed there for a year. I wrote and thought about little else in the first half of 2020. Why this intense preoccupation? The answer is that, although my core competency is financial history, I have been keenly interested in the role of disease in history ever since studying the Hamburg cholera epidemic of 1892 as a graduate student more than 30 years ago. Richard Evans’ meticulously detailed study of that episode introduced me to the idea that the mortality caused by a deadly pathogen is partly a reflection of the social and political order it attacks. It was the class structure as much as the bacterium Vibrio cholerae that killed people in Hamburg, Germany, Evans argued, because the entrenched power of the city’s property owners had been an insuperable obstacle to improving the city’s antiquated water and sewage systems. The mortality rate for the poor was 13 times higher than for the rich. Researching “The Pity of War” a few years later, I was struck by statistics that suggested the German army had collapsed in 1918 partly because of a surge of illness, possibly resulting from the Spanish influenza pandemic. “The War of the World” (Penguin, 2006) delved more deeply into the history of the 1918-19 pandemic, showing how the First World War ended with twin pandemics — not only influenza but also the ideological contagion of Bolshevism. The work I did on empires in the 2000s also involved excursions into the history of contagious disease. No account of European settlement in the New World could have omitted the role that disease played in “thinning the Indians , to make room for the English , ” as John Archdale, the governor of Carolina in the 1690s, callously remarked. (The title of the second chapter of my book “Empire” was “White Plague.”) I was also very struck by the terrible toll of tropical disease on British soldiers stationed far from home: A man’s chances of surviving a tour of duty in Sierra Leone were pitifully low — 1 in 2. “ The Great Degeneration” (Penguin, 2014) explicitly warned of our growing vulnerability to “the ... random mutation of viruses like influenza,” while “The Square and the Tower” (Penguin, 2017) was essentially a history of the world based on the insight that “network structures are as important as viruses in determining the speed and extent of a contagion.” The COVID-19 pandemic is far from over. The death toll worldwide approaches five million, which is certainly an underestimate, as the statistics from a number of large countries (notably Iran and Russia) cannot be trusted. And the cumulative body count continues to rise globally — to say nothing of the number of people whose health has been permanently damaged, which no one has yet estimated. It seems increasingly likely that Lord Martin Rees, Britain’s astronomer royal, has won his bet with the Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker that “bioterror or bioerror will lead to one million casualties in a single event within a six month period starting no later than Dec 31 2020.” Some epidemiologists have argued that, without drastic social distancing and economic lockdowns, the ultimate death toll could have been between 30 million and 40 million. Because of government restrictions and changes in public behavior, it will surely not be as high. Cemetery workers lower the coffin of a COVID-19 victim into his grave at the Vila Formosa cemetery in Sao Paulo, Brazil, late Wednesday, March 31, 2021. Because of the increased number of deaths in the city, the burial service in some public cemeteries has been extended to the hours of the night. (AP Photo/Nelson Antoine) ASSOCIATED PRESS Yet precisely these “nonpharmaceutical interventions” have inflicted a shock on the world economy far greater than that caused by the 2008-09 financial crisis — potentially as great as the shock of the Great Depression, but compressed into months, not years. Governments had to take drastic fiscal measures to stave off a collapse of the markets. You see, disasters and their impact are rarely entirely exogenous events, with the exception of a massive meteor strike, which hasn’t happened in 66 million years, or an alien invasion, which hasn’t happened at all. Even a catastrophic earthquake is only as catastrophic as the extent of urbanization along the fault line — or the shoreline, if it triggers a tsunami. A pandemic is made up of a new pathogen and the social networks that it attacks. We cannot understand the scale of the contagion by studying only the virus itself, because the virus will infect only as many people as social networks allow it to. At the same time, a catastrophe lays bare the societies and states that it strikes. It is a moment of truth, of revelation, exposing some as fragile, others as resilient, and others as “antifragile” — able not just to withstand disaster but to be strengthened by it. We still find ourselves in the middle of this pandemic, about which it’s hard to gain the perspective that hindsight affords. But looking at past pandemics and disasters not only helps provide perspective on the current one, but also allow us to understand and prepare for the inevitability of the next one. So cometh now My Lady Influenza, like a star Inebriously wan, and in her train Fever, the haggard soul’s white nenuphur, And lily-fingered Death, and grisly Pain And Constipation who makes all things vain, Pneumonyer, Cancer, and Nasal Catarrh. Rupert Brooke’s “To My Lady Influenza” (1906) was a facetious undergraduate work. Yet “Lady Influenza” was never to be trifled with. The first well-described influenza outbreaks were in 16th-century Europe, but the earliest was probably in 1173. There had been significant influenza pandemics in the 18th and 19th centuries, but the 20th century was to be hit much harder. A more populous world was also a more urban world and a more mobile world — a world in which low air quality in industrial towns may have made people more susceptible to respiratory illnesses. A year after Brooke wrote “To My Lady Influenza,” his eldest brother, Dick, died of pneumonia at the age of 26. Brooke himself would live only a year longer, dying of an infected mosquito bite that led to sepsis, off the Greek island of Skyros. A predictable “gray rhino,” in the sense that danger of a general European war was well known, but also a surprising “black swan,” in the sense that contemporaries seemed bewildered by its outbreak, the First World War was a true dragon-king event in terms of its vast historical consequences. As disastrous as the war was, its proximate impact in terms of lives lost was exceeded by that of the influenza pandemic that broke out in its final year. Where exactly the new strain of H1N1 first appeared is uncertain, but it is usually said to have been Fort Riley, Kansas, the site of Camp Funston, one of the network of Army camps where hundreds of thousands of young American men were being trained to fight in Europe as the American Expeditionary Forces. There is, however, evidence that the pandemic originated in the British Army in 1917, though the condition was initially identified as “purulent bronchitis with bronchopneumonia.” Here was the key to influenza’s 20th-century success. Never had armies been mobilized on such a scale before — more than 70 million men in uniform. Never had so many young men been taken from their homes and workplaces, crowded into primitive accommodations, and sent over long distances in ships and trains. The idea that the virus originated in pigs has been refuted (an avian origin seems more likely); if anything, the direction of infection was from men to pigs. The first American cases were recorded at Camp Funston on March 4. A week later, a member of Fort Riley’s catering staff entered the infirmary, followed in the coming days by a stream of infected soldiers. By the end of the month, more than a thousand cases had been recorded and 48 men had died of influenza. As if to mock the efforts of men to kill one another, the virus spread rapidly across the United States and then crossed to Europe on the jam-packed American troopships. It is possible that the pandemic explains the near doubling of the proportion of German soldiers reporting sick in the summer of 1918, which was a crucial factor in the imperial army’s subsequent collapse. Certainly, we have reports of German prisoners of war with the flu from July. By that time it had reached India, Australia and New Zealand. A few months later, a second and deadlier wave struck all but simultaneously in Brest, France; Freetown, Sierra Leone; and Boston. The virus made a new landfall in the United States at Boston’s Commonwealth Pier on Aug. 27, 1918, when three cases of influenza appeared on the sick list. Eight cases emerged the next day, and 58 the next, 15 of whom were so ill they were transferred to the U.S. Naval Hospital in Chelsea. On Sept. 8, influenza arrived at the Army’s Camp Devens. Within 10 days, thousands of feverish patients overwhelmed the camp’s hospitals; within weeks, the morgue was full of blue-tinged, asphyxiated corpses. Combatant countries sought to suppress the news of the pandemic as potentially harmful to wartime morale; this hardly helped to keep the public informed. The disease came to be known as the Spanish flu because only the largely uncensored press of neutral Spain reported on it with any accuracy. Between 40 million and 50 million people died as a result of the pandemic, the majority of them suffocated by a lethal accumulation of blood and other fluid in the lungs. The absolute numbers were highest in India (18.5 million deaths) and China (between 4 million and 9.5 million), but death rates varied widely from place to place. Close to half (44.5%) of the population of Cameroon was wiped out; in Western Samoa, nearly a quarter (23.6%). The worst mortality rates in Europe were in Hungary and Spain (each around 1.2%), with Italy not far behind. By contrast, North America got off lightly: between 0.53% and 0.65% for the United States, 0.61% for Canada. As these figures imply, the Spanish flu was indifferent as to a country’s combatant status. While its initial spread may have been related to wartime accommodation and transportation, that soon ceased to be true. In the United States, the deaths of as many as 675,000 people were attributed to the Spanish flu, of which 550,000 were excess deaths (above what would have been expected in that period under normal circumstances). Equivalent mortality in 2020 would have been between 1.8 million and 2.2 million Americans. The Spanish flu killed an order of magnitude more Americans than died in combat in the war (53,402). Ironically, unlike most flu epidemics, but like the war that preceded and spread it, the influenza of 1918 disproportionately killed young adults. Out of 272,500 male influenza deaths in the United States, nearly 49% were aged 20 to 39, whereas only 18% were under five and 13% were over 50. The very young and very old were also (as usual) vulnerable, so that all countries for which age-specific death rates are available recorded a roughly W-shaped age distribution of mortality. Death was not caused by the influenza virus itself so much as by the body’s immunological reaction to the virus. Perversely, this meant that individuals with the strongest immune systems were more likely to die than those with weaker immune systems. A good illustration of the impact of the pandemic on young adults, as well as a vivid description of the hallucinogenic miseries of the illness itself, can be found in Katherine Anne Porter’s short story “Pale Horse, Pale Rider” (1937), about a wartime romance cut cruelly short by the virus. In Sept. 2021, COVID-19’s American death toll overtook that of the 1918 flu. And yet, in Aug. 2020, it appeared that, with a regime of mass testing, contact tracing, social distancing and targeted quarantining, a country could contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2, as the virus relied heavily on superspreaders for its transmission and disproportionately sickened or killed people past retirement age. Only in the spring of 2021 did it join the elite of pandemics — the 20 or so in recorded history that killed upward of 0.05% of humanity. Only a handful of those nations that fought World War II have lost more people per day to COVID-19 than they have lost to the Axis powers. The United States is one of those countries. This illustrates something profound — that all disasters are at some level man-made political disasters, even if they originate with new pathogens. Politics explained why World War II killed 25 times as many Germans as Americans. Politics also helps to explain why COVID-19 has thus far killed more than eight times as many Americans as Germans.

(AP Photo/Anupam Nath) ASSOCIATED PRESS This plague began as a gray rhino, predicted by many. It struck as a black swan, somehow completely unforeseen. Could it become a world-changing “dragon king”? As we have seen, disasters of any kind become truly epoch-making events only if their economic, social and political ramifications amount to more than the excess mortality they cause. Could this medium-size disaster nevertheless alter our lives permanently and profoundly? Let me now hazard three guesses. First, COVID-19 will be to social life what AIDS was to sexual life: It will change our behavior, though by no means enough to avert a significant number of premature deaths. I myself welcome a new age of social distancing, but then I am a natural misanthrope who hates crowds and will not greatly miss hugs and handshakes. Most people, however, will be unable to resist the temptations of post-lockdown gregariousness. There will be unsafe socializing just as there still is unsafe sex, even after more than three decades and 30 million deaths from HIV. Second, and for that reason, most big cities are not “over.” Do we all now head from Gotham or the Great Wen to the villages, there to cultivate our vegetable gardens in splendid, rustic isolation? Do nearly half of us continue to work from home, as we did during the pandemic — more than three times more than before? Probably not. It takes a lot to kill a city. True, just over a century after Thomas Mann wrote “Death in Venice” (1912), Venice is pretty much dead. But it was not cholera that killed it — it was the shifting pattern of international trade. Likewise, COVID-19 will not kill London or New York; it will just make them cheaper, grungier and younger. Some billionaires will not return. Some firms and many families will move to the suburbs or even farther afield. Tax revenues will drop. Crime rates will jump. As Gerald Ford supposedly did in 1975, when the city asked for a federal bailout, another president may tell New York to “drop dead.” San Francisco will lose talent to Austin. But inertia is a powerful thing. Americans these days relocate less than they used to. Only a third of jobs can really be done at home; everyone else will still need to work in offices, shops and factories. Workplaces will just be different — more spacious and campus-like, as they already are in Silicon Valley. Commuting will no longer involve being packed like sardines on a subway. No more unwelcome intimacies on elevators. Masks over most faces. No more tut-tutting at the hijab and the niqab. Perforce, we are all modest now. What of the pandemic’s impact on the generational imbalances that had grown so intolerable in many societies by 2020? Was COVID-19 sent by Freya, the goddess of youth, to emancipate millennials and Generation Z from bearing the fiscal burden of an excessive number of elderly people? It is tempting to marvel at this ageist virus. No previous pandemic was so discriminating against the elderly and in favor of the young. But in truth, the impact of COVID-19 in terms of excess mortality will probably not be great enough to balance the intergenerational accounts. In the short run, the majority of old people will remain retired; relatively few will die prematurely — hardly any in the most elderly of countries, Japan. The young, meanwhile, will be the ones struggling to find jobs (other than with Amazon) and struggling almost as much to have fun. An economy without crowds is not a “new normal.” It may be more like the new anomie, to borrow Émile Durkheim’s term for the sense of disconnectedness he associated with modernity. For most young people, the word “fun” is almost synonymous with “crowd.” The era of distancing will be a time of depression in the psychological as well as the economic sense. The gloom has been especially deep for Generation Z, whose university social lives — half the point of college, if not more — were wrecked. They spent yet more time on electronic devices — perhaps an hour a day more than before the pandemic. It did not make them happier. History tells us to expect the great punctuation marks of disaster in no predictable order. The four horsemen of the Book of Revelation — Conquest, War, Famine and the pale rider Death — gallop out at seemingly random intervals to remind us that no amount of technological innovation can make mankind invulnerable. Indeed, some innovations — like those fleets of jet airplanes that transported so many infected people from Wuhan to the rest of the world in Jan. 2020 — give the horsemen the opportunity to ride in their slipstream. Yet somehow the riders’ arrival always takes us by surprise. For a moment, we contemplate the scenario of total extinction. We shelter in place, watching “Contagion” or reading Atwood. Perhaps the black swan becomes a dragon king and turns life upside down. But very rarely. Mostly, for the lucky many, life after the disaster goes on, changed in a few ways but on the whole remarkably, reassuringly, boringly the same. With astonishing speed, we put our brush with mortality behind us and blithely carry on, forgetful of those who were not so lucky, regardless of the next disaster that lies in wait.

Athletes have been told to “minimise physical interaction”, wear a mask, avoid spaces that are enclosed or crowded and maintain a two-metre distance from others during their stay in the country. Vaccination for all Games-related individuals is key – those who are not fully vaccinated would be required to serve a mandatory 21-day period of “hard” hotel quarantine upon arrival. A closed-loop system will be in operation and athletes can only travel in “dedicated vehicles between permitted destinations”. No contact with the general public or anyone outside of the closed loop will be permitted.

Australian Jews emerge from lockdown and severe restrictions on Jewish life,https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/australian-jews-emerge-from-lockdown-and-severe-restrictions-on-jewish-life-683082,,,,"During COVID-19, Australia has become know for some of the most severe lockdowns in the world.",,2021-10-25 18:54:31,"During the COVID-19 pandemic era, has become known for some of the most severe lockdowns in the world, designed to keep the disease out of the country and prevent the local spread of contagion. Last week, Melbourne, in the state of Victoria, exited a 78-day lockdown, and cumulatively was subject to more than 260 days of confinement since the pandemic first hit. Meanwhile, Sydney ended a whopping 107-day lockdown two weeks ago and has in total endured 159 days of such restrictions. This means Australian Jews have experienced longer lockdowns than the overwhelming majority of their brethren around the world. For Jewish communities in cities such as Melbourne and Sydney, the largest Jewish centers, the lockdowns have been keenly felt, with what was hitherto normal religious and communal life grinding to a halt for long periods, as happened to numerous other Jewish communities around the globe. Melbourne, Australia (credit: PIXABAY) How did these lockdowns affect religious and communal life, and what will be their impact into the future? Rabbi Dr. Ben Elton, the chief minister of The Great Synagogue in Sydney, said the community suffered significantly as a result of the prolonged periods of movement restrictions. Weddings were postponed, funerals were restricted to just 10 mourners, and many bar and bat mitzvah ceremonies were forced online instead of happening with the young boy’s or girl’s friends and family. In-person prayer services were obviously canceled during the week and on Shabbat. And High Holy Day services, the pinnacle of the Jewish calendar, were a complete write-off two years running. Elton noted that this past Rosh Hashanah, the Australian Board of Deputies, a communal leadership organization, negotiated with the government to allow shofar-blowing in public parks, and 50 minutes of outdoor prayer over Yom Kippur. “Thousands of people came to those events from across the city. It was the first real communal moment since June, and people had a huge morale boost because of it,” said the rabbi. Earlier this month, Sydney and the state of New South Wales in which it is located, came out of lockdown, first in a restricted manner and then in accordance with vaccination targets with fewer and fewer restrictions. Elton said that on that first Shabbat after the lockdown ended, with restrictions already easing, his synagogue was already nearly back up to pre-coronavirus levels of attendance, such was the desire of congregants to resume normal religious life. And he noted that the flocking of congregants back to synagogue this time around is markedly different from what happened after previous lockdowns when he said people returned much more slowly, likely due to the fact that vaccines had not been rolled out at the time. Indeed, it took a full year to get back to pre-COVID levels for Shabbat services, before new lockdowns were imposed. He said several synagogues initially struggled to get a minyan, a quorum of 10 men, for weekday services and notes that one synagogue in downtown Sydney had to make its morning service later in order to ensure it had enough participants. The rabbi said he expects that many lectures, classes and other events which moved online during the worst of the pandemic will remain there, but that he does not believe there will be a long-term impact on communal religious life given the requirements of Jewish law for Orthodox practice. “Jewish life depends on being in the same place at the same time, at least in Orthodoxy,” he pointed out. Rabbi Yonatan Sadoff heads Melbourne’s only Conservative synagogue, Kehilat Nitzan, and said that things in his community have changed a little bit more. He said that in the face of the pandemic and the interminable lockdowns, his community was faced with a dilemma as to how to proceed in terms of prayer services over Shabbat and holidays. Eventually, the synagogue made “a difficult decision” and began to live-stream its services to give his congregants the ability to reconnect with religious and communal life as best as possible. Jewish law largely prohibits the use of electronic devices over Shabbat, something which many Conservative or Masorti congregations also abide by. “We decided this was an emergency period for the Jewish people, and that we wanted to do this in the most halachically permissible way possible,” said Sadoff, noting that the live-streamed services were broadcast via security cameras and that congregants were given instructions as to how to log on before Shabbat so as to minimize infractions of Jewish law. Sadoff said that these live-streamed services got good traction with members of his community, and even attracted people who were members of Orthodox synagogues but more flexible in their attitude toward Shabbat observance. “Most of the Australian Jewish community is Orthodox or belongs to Orthodox synagogues, but they didn’t have anything for the Shabbat and the holidays,” he said. “So we felt we were providing something for the larger community, and we opened it up for free to others.” The rabbi said the lockdowns generated “high levels of stress, anxiety and psychological strain,” due to the prolonged isolation they caused, something which the synagogue tried to alleviate through an array of online programs. Daily prayer services moved online in a limited format and, Sadoff notes, have remained there even after the lockdown was lifted, with his synagogue joining with the Conservative congregation in Sydney for weekday services via video conferencing. Sadoff said that after the previous lockdown, attendance on Shabbat mornings reached up to three quarters of previous levels before new restrictions were introduced, but said people were now excited to return to in-person services. Still, he believes that the effects of the pandemic on in-person synagogue attendance might be long-lasting, but that this would not necessarily be a negative phenomenon. “When something is stopped in a fundamental way because of a certain situation, something about that gets broken, but it also allows for new things to happen,” said the rabbi. “People are going to question synagogue and Jewish spirituality, and make new decisions, and maybe this will cause a shift to something more meaningful, meaning that people won’t accept things they have faked for a long time if prayer isn’t stirring at all and is just about what we’ve always done and what we’re supposed to do. “People might think it has to move them in some deeper way, how it makes them a better person, function better, and be a contribution and blessing to the world.” Not far away from Sadoff’s synagogue in Melbourne is South Caulfield Hebrew Congregation headed by Rabbi Daniel Rabin, although he is soon to move on to a new posting at a larger community in the city. Like Rabbis Elton and Sadoff, Rabin too noted the strain the lockdowns put on communal Jewish life, and his efforts to keep the community together in some format through online programming, as well as online pastoral care through phone calls, emails, and social media. He said his synagogue even experienced a growth in membership as previously unaffiliated people became interested in the array of programming available, and its ease of access. But he also noted the fatigue that congregants experienced with online spiritual life. Rabin said that after the High Holy Days of 2020, he got dozens of messages from people in his community thanking him for the various initiatives he and the synagogue took to help people through the period. After the recent holiday period, the novelty of that had worn off and people seemed more fed up with the situation than previously. Having had doubts and “genuine concern” about how many people would return for in-person services, Rabin said his experience over last Shabbat, the first after lockdown, proved him wrong. His synagogue quickly filled its quota of 50 congregants and hopes to fill this coming Shabbat’s 150 person allowance as well. Rabin says that there might be some who are slower to come back due to safety concerns about living with as opposed to trying to keep it out, but that ultimately he sees religious life returning to normal. “It was very special,” he said of last Shabbat, the first communal Shabbat since the lockdown ended. “I could genuinely see the joy and feeling of relief that people were back together and praying as a community. “People did suffer from having their religious services taken away. There is a real desire for human connection, and for many people that is synagogue and synagogue community.”",,jpost

Neighboring South Africa earlier this week said it would not approve Sputnik V due to concerns it could increase the risk of human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) infection among men. The Namibian health ministry said in a statement that following South Africa's decision it was suspending, with immediate effect, use of the shots until the formula is listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization. ""The reason for discontinuation of the administration of the vaccine is being done out of an abundance of caution that men who received Sputnik V may be at higher risk of contracting HIV when exposed to it,"" said the ministry.",,2021-10-24 16:00:00,,,manilatimes

Student who collapsed on night out ‘terrified’ club spiker will attack again,https://metro.co.uk/2021/10/25/student-who-collapsed-in-club-terrified-that-spiker-may-attack-again-15483303/,"['UK', 'crime', 'Nottingham', 'Priti Patel', 'Theresa May']",['Josh Layton'],,"Sarah Buckle, 19, passed out and began vomiting and choking after being poisoned on a night out in Nottingham.","Sarah Buckle has written to the Home Secretary, Priti Patel, calling for government action to make nightclubs safer for women (Picture: Sarah Buckle/ITV/Getty) The victim of a suspected needle spiking attack is calling on the government to enact measures to protect women on nights out. Sarah Buckle is ‘terrified’ at the thought that the culprit is still on the loose, six weeks after she was hosptalised on a night out. The 19-year-old has approached her constituency MP, Theresa May, and the Home Secretary, Priti Patel, calling for clubs to be made to introduce safety and security precautions to protect guests from injections with needles and substances slipped into drinks. The University of Nottingham student said she collapsed and began choking after falling ill on the night out and is ‘really scared’ that whoever was responsible has not been caught by police. After arriving in the club, which she does want to name, at around 11pm her last memory is meeting some friends at the bar before she was discharged from hospital around 10 hours later. Sarah spoke after an outcry over needles being used to spike women with powerful so-called date rape drugs at nightclubs across the UK. ‘It all came out of nowhere,’ she said. ‘My friends said I stopped talking and I tried typing something on my phone but it wasn’t making sense. I wasn’t able to speak or stand up, so security said to me to leave. ‘My friends got in a taxi with me and at this point I started really violently throwing up. Apparently I started screaming as well and I was going unconscious. I was in and out of this horrible state. In the taxi they called an ambulance to meet us at the house. ‘When the ambulance arrived I was unconscious and choking.’ Sarah’s left hand was throbbing and a mark resembling a pin-prick on the back suggests a needle was used, but she also believes there is a chance her drink could have spiked. ‘However it happened it doesn’t change the fact that women are in danger,’ she said. ‘It’s really important that nightclubs take responsibility to ensure these attacks are less likely to happen and they need to introduce protocols such as mandatory searches, providing bottle stoppers and lid covers and having no CCTV blind spots. ‘Staff also need to be informed what to look out for after and be more sympathetic to the fact that not everyone has had too much to drink. ‘The government needs to make sure it is easier for hospitals and police to communicate, collect and share evidence. I don’t think we’ll ever eradicate these attacks, but we can make them less likely.’ Sarah Buckle says she has suffered anxiety since she was the victim of a spiking incident in a Nottingham club (Picture: Sarah Buckle) In her letter to the MPs, the management student says that in the past few days she has been approached by ‘hundreds of young women who have experienced similar incidents to me, or have recommendations about measures which can be implemented to help prevent further attacks’. The suggestions also include making it mandatory for clubs to scan IDs on entry and exit, recording who was in a venue at a certain time. Although there has been a national outcry and police forces have made a number of arrests, the second year’s case is still being investigated. She told Metro.co.uk that because her tests weren’t taken at an optimal time when the incident occurred on September 28 or in the early hours of the following day, it’s unlikely they will show anything once they have been examined in a laboratory. Sarah Buckle woke up in hospital after a night out with no memory of how she got there and a throbbing pain in her left hand (Picture: ITV) A night out with friends turned into an ordeal for Sarah Buckle after she was administered an incapacitating substance (Picture: Sarah Buckle) ‘I’m terrified at the fact that whoever did this is still out there,’ she said. ‘I’m really, really scared. That’s another reason why I’m demanding that the government does more to protect women. ‘I understand it is hard to make arrests and secure convictions so it’s important to make sure that those responsible have little chance to carry out these attacks again. ‘I’ve suffered extreme anxiousness that this could happen again to me or my friends. It makes you question everyone. Sarah Buckle found a mark resembling a pin-prick on her hand but believes there is also a chance she could have had her drink spiked (Picture: Sarah Buckle) ‘It was at a freshers’ night and while you think of middle age men harassing young women, it could have been someone I go to university with. ‘Who knows? It’s a really scary thought.’ Sarah joined calls from students and other women demanding the government and nightclub industry does more to tackle the problem.

Jayaprakash, who had created quite a splash in the international swimming pools to win medals for India, also told Modi about Garuda Aerospace's drone activities in Varanasi, the Lok Sabha constituency from which the Prime Minister was elected. Jayaprakash met Modi on October 22 after clearing the COVID-19 test the previous day. ""I shared a brief on Garuda's ongoing projects in NHAI, NTPC, Survey of India, SAIL & Drone Delivery of medicines, vegetables in Varanasi Smart City and ISRO to which the Prime Minister had insisted that Urban Air Mobility in geographically isolated areas and food delivery using drones are areas we need to work on to benefit the citizens,"" said Jayaprakash. Garuda Aerospace was incidentally in the news recently for getting SpaceX Founder and Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk to notice their New Solar Panel Cleaning Surya Drone and subsequently raised $1 million in Pre-Series A Funding from a UK-based fund. According to Jayaprakash, Garuda Aerospace has about 300 drones and about 500 pilots and has a valuation of about Rs.400 crore. The company that offers drone-based services like spraying of pesticides/disinfectants, industrial mapping and others has an order book position of about Rs 23 crore. ""We plan to expand our manufacturing capacity with the fresh funds. Presently, we can make about 25 drones per day. Apart from offering drone-based services, we also sell drones. Farmers in South India, Haryana and Punjab are buying our agriculture drones,"" Jayaprakash said.

Although these topics have their relevance over the short term, they shouldn't detract from a company's long-term growth trajectory. With that, we asked some of Fool.com contributors which growth stocks were great buys now. They reached into their goody bags and pulled out three treats. Here's what makes Fisker ( NYSE:FSR ) , United Parcel Service ( NYSE:UPS ) , and Emerson Electric ( NYSE:EMR ) all great buys now. Image source: Getty Images. An EV stock to park in your portfolio Scott Levine (Fisker ): Revving up to present its third-quarter earnings report on Nov. 3, Fisker is an electric vehicle company that is a fairly new option for investors, having made its market debut almost exactly one year ago. Those who follow the EV industry closely will surely recognize the company's name; however, it's also likely that many investors are unfamiliar with the EV start-up considering the flurry of EV companies that have gone public through special purpose acquisition company deals recently. Add to this the fact that Fisker doesn't have any vehicles on the road yet, and it's probable that Fisker is not on many growth investors' radars. But it certainly should be. Between the company's disruptive approach to financing and the stock trading at around $14 -- 55% below its 52-week high -- it certainly warrants consideration . One of the biggest challenges facing EV makers is the hesitancy that prospective customers have regarding charging their vehicles. Helping to allay these concerns, Fisker offers customers who find that they're not as charged up about going electric as they thought they'd be the option to return leased vehicles at any time without penalty. Management's willingness to implement an innovative approach to vehicle leasing suggests that it's not only cognizant of a potential roadblock to its success, but that it's not willing to yield to convention. As of early August, Fisker has 17,500 reservations for its Ocean SUV, indicating that there's already interest in the company's offering. By 2025, management is targeting annual sales of 200,000 to 250,000 -- a year in which it expects to expand its product offerings to four vehicles and which it expects to recognize a sizable improvement in its financials. While the company expects to generate free cash flow of negative $300 million in 2022, it forecasts free cash flow of $1.9 billion in 2025. That's the type of growth that can electrify investors' excitement. UPS has long-term upside but may face near-term setbacks Daniel Foelber (United Parcel Service): America's largest package delivery company, UPS, reports Q3 earnings on Tuesday. In addition to watching the usual suspects like the top and bottom line, margins, and other financial figures, investors will likely have their eyes peeled and their ears perked to gain insight into management's thoughts on supply chain constraints and the labor shortage. Investors following the package delivery space know that FedEx and UPS report earnings about six weeks apart instead of at the same time. This staggered schedule is convenient because it provides more frequent insight into industrywide headwinds and tailwinds. FedEx's most recent earnings report illustrated the sheer magnitude that the tight labor market and challenging supply chain are having on its margins. Its quarter wasn't pretty, and FedEx stock fell hard , dragging down UPS with it. To combat inflation, FedEx is raising prices next year. Investors should listen to UPS management's commentary on these topics to see how it expects to navigate market challenges, and the extent that it, too, will raise prices (if at all). In addition to these short-term talking points, growth investors will likely monitor UPS' e-commerce growth , rebound in business-to-business sales, and international performance. UPS is a value stock that has been transforming into a growth stock over the last few years because it's leaned into previously untapped markets. Its investments to grow its e-commerce offering have made it a preferred shipping and logistics partner for small and medium-sized businesses. Investors should gird their loins if UPS expects a sizable impact to its short-term performance due to macroeconomic factors. But as long as the big picture remains intact, UPS is one of the best industrial stocks on the market today . Emerson Electric is about to enter a growth phase Lee Samaha (Emerson Electric): It's been a long time coming, but energy-related spending is making a comeback. That's great news for companies with substantive process automation businesses like Emerson Electric. In total, oil and gas make up around 19% of Emerson's sales with chemicals and refining contributing another 11% and 6%. Process automation is the processing of raw materials into an initial product. As a result, spending in the industry tends to be lumpy and contingent on customers feeling confident in the long-term outlook for their end markets. As such, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a stalling of investment within the processing industry. However, oil services companies like Halliburton are talking about an extended upcycle in oil and gas spending. Meanwhile, Emerson's process automation rival Honeywell International noted that its refining catalyst and absorbents orders surged by 30% in the second quarter. That's important because it suggests refining investment is coming back, and as Honeywell's management noted , that usually flows through into increased spending in process automation down the line. Everything points to a cyclical recovery in Emerson's process automation. Meanwhile, the company's commercial and residential solutions segment's (climate technology, energy efficiency, refrigeration) orders were up a whopping 43% in the trailing three months to June, so future revenue growth is assured. And finally, the recent deal to take a 55% stake in industrial software company Aspen Technology adds another string to the bow of Emerson's software expansion strategy. All told, Emerson looks well set for growth in the coming years.",,fool
"‘Just like history has layers, so does supernatural activity’ – pandemic trauma sparks surge in paranormal contact",https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/just-like-history-has-layers-so-does-supernatural-activity-pandemic-trauma-sparks-surge-in-paranormal-contact-40980814.html,['Irish News'],,,Ghost hunters have noted a significant increase in paranormal activity at some of Ireland’s most haunted sites since the Covid-19 pandemic erupted.,,2021-10-25 01:30:00,"Ghost hunters have noted a significant increase in paranormal activity at some of Ireland’s most haunted sites since the Covid-19 pandemic erupted. A ccording to two of the country’s leading paranormal investigation groups, Ireland ranks among the highest in the world for paranormal activity. Some of Ireland’s spookiest sites include Kilmainhan Gaol in Dublin, Loftus Hall in Wexford, Ross Castle in Meath and Spike Island in Cork, as well as Charleville and Leap Castles in Offaly. Paranormal investigators consider that, on a per capita basis, Offaly ranks as the most haunted county in Ireland. Irish Paranormal Investigations (IPI) official Ann Massey said reports of increased activity had included a surging number of contacts from the public about unexplained occurrences in people’s homes, not just known haunted houses and castles. Read More ‘Hospitals are at full tilt’: Urgent demand to give health workers the booster jab It is believed the traumatic impact on society of the world’s worst pandemic since the 1918 Spanish Flu has somehow heightened contacts between the living and spirit worlds. Ms Massey said such ‘step-over’ activity between the human and spirit worlds was common in times of societal trauma such as wars and pandemics. “From our perspective as a group we have been getting a lot more contact from people – especially in their private houses,” she said. “It is twofold – more people are more aware of what is going on around them now and noticing these step-overs from the spirit realm.

Enter email address This field is required Sign Up “They would normally be too busy to notice these things. “The other thing is in respect of the touristy places where we investigate – Malahide or Spike – because people aren’t constantly in there, the spirits or whatever they are have been given a chance to recharge, if you like. “They re-energise and then react (more strongly) when suddenly people do come back and into these places.” Ms Massey said they investigated strange occurrences which could not be explained away by environmental factors or heating, electrical, plumbing and animal activity. The IPI team includes Ms Massey, Dominic McElroy, Liam Canty and up to three others. Their investigations range from measuring physical, electrical and temperature changes through to examining the history and even archaeology of an area. Most haunted houses have exploited their paranormal legends with successful commercial offerings ranging from ghost tours to Halloween parties. Leap Castle even offers a special evening meal dubbed ‘Dining with the Dead’. However, the most feared site in Ireland is the Hellfire Club located at Montpelier Hill in Dublin. Built as a hunting lodge, legend has it the structure disturbed an ancient burial site – and has been troubled by angry spirits ever since. But its dark reputation dates from the mid-18th century when it was rumoured to have been used by the Hellfire Club, a group of dissolute nobles, for parties. Such was the behaviour of the group that it was even rumoured the building hosted ‘black masses’ – and that at each dinner a chair was deliberately left empty in case Satan decided to attend. Ms Massey said paranormal activity noted at the Hellfire Club had even extended to the estate grounds and woods. She said such was Ireland’s rich folklore history that almost every part of the country had stories of hauntings and supernatural activity. “Just like history has layers, so does supernatural activity,” she said. Ms Massey said her favourite investigation sites in Ireland were Dundrum, Tipperary and Cork’s Spike Island. “Prisons are places where there can be a lot of paranormal activity,” she said. Co-founder of Paranormal Supernatural Investigations Ireland (PSI), Richard Morrison (42), said Ireland was noted on an international scale for its residual energy and paranormal activity. “I think Ireland is up there in the top two at least, even as paranormal researchers we’re amazed. “We find that 95pc of the evidence that we capture is after the investigation from our appointment that’s gathered the evidence. “It’s very rarely something will happen visually, it’s our equipment that’s capturing all this. Ireland has a lot of history and the energy here is very active for paranormal researching. “We believe the whole land itself has got a lot of residual energy,” he said. Mr Morrison said the group preferred not to be referred to as ‘ghost hunters’; he said they researched locations that they believed had residual energy. “We research an area, analyse our evidence and see if we can back up any of the claims that the place is spiritually haunted,” he said. Mr Morrison has had personal experiences with paranormal activity since he was a young child. “My great-grandfather passed away during an operation. I always remember I asked, ‘Would you ever visit me, Granddad, if you died?’ and his exact words were, ‘Of course I’d come and visit you’. “He went in for a routine operation and he sadly passed away. A few nights after his death I woke up and for some reason my head was drawn to my bedside table, I remember seeing this luminous green outline of a person and I got the feeling that I knew that was my grandfather. “I was only six. Children are very open, they have their third eye and they’re very spiritually connected. “They can see things that maybe adults can’t see and as we get older, we tend to close that spiritual side of us. The second night that same incident happened again. “Then, when I was 15 I saw the same figure was standing at the bottom of my bed. I ran into my parents’ bedroom and told them. “My parents always told me it was a dream.” He went on: “It is nice to share the evidence that we’ve been gathering with people. Some people will always be sceptical and that’s the way human nature is. The way we work we just put the evidence out there and we let people decide for themselves.” Mr Morrison said the Galway-based group recently captured a photo of a ghostly figure in the window of Moore Hall in Co Mayo. “The image is as clear as day,” he said. “There’s no inside stairs or floors, it’s a complete shell of a house. “We love to go investigate these places because we research the history of the location.” Read More ‘Hospitals are at full tilt’: Urgent demand to give health workers the booster jab",https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/23eb4/40980812.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/atural%20Galway%2019543.jpg,independent
Researchers confirm how to decontaminate and reuse masks during COVID-19 pandemic,https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-10-decontaminate-reuse-masks-covid-pandemic.html,"['Diseases', 'Conditions', 'Syndromes']",,,"An international study involving University of Alberta researchers has revealed two effective ways to sterilize disposable masks, potentially allowing them to be reused by health-care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in areas with limited resources.",,2021-10-25 19:33:38,"An international study involving University of Alberta researchers has revealed two effective ways to sterilize disposable masks, potentially allowing them to be reused by health-care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in areas with limited resources. The study, led out of the University of Colorado and involving an international consortium of researchers, offers health authorities clear steps they can use to safely and cost-effectively sterilize personal protective equipment (PPE). ""There are lots of parts of the world that don't have the resources that we do,"" said David Evans, a member of the U of A's Li Ka Shing Institute of Virology, who was involved in the study. ""So if we can come up with a strategy that would help safely reuse those materials, that would be great for everyone."" The research teams tested two sterilization methods: Heat, and a combination of methylene blue —a compound commonly used in blood banks to kill pathogens—and bright light . The researchers were split into two groups—a virology group and a mask group. The virology group tested methods of cleaning six types of masks that had been contaminated with the SARS-CoV-2 virus or a surrogate virus. The masks ranged from a common homemade cotton mask to the N95 mask typically used by hospital health-care workers. Scientists in the mask group then tested the sterilized masks to ensure they retained their protective qualities. According to Evans, both methods of sterilization worked similarly well. ""Heat is a pretty good way of inactivating these viruses ,"" he said. ""We found that after 15 minutes at 65 degrees Celsius in humid air, the virus was all gone. At 75 degrees Celsius, we saw the same effect. However, the method is complicated by the effects of humidity, as less killing is seen in dry air."" In some cases heat could damage the elastic of the mask straps, so Evans believes there may be a slight advantage to using methylene blue with light. ""What we've discovered is that a significant amount of the inactivation takes place without needing to add a lot of light, but it does sort of finish the job for you,"" he noted. An unforeseen advantage seems to be that masks treated with methylene blue are reported to smell ""fresh""—a small but important consideration for health-care workers. Evans stressed that exacting laboratory practices are essential to the effectiveness of the methods. ""It's easy enough to say, 'Oh, we'll just treat the mask and carry on.' Well, how do you know that you haven't ruined the properties of the mask? This study is intended to give clear guidance for health authorities that could be put into practice with confidence,"" he said. ""From the perspective of a health-care provider, being really sure that their protective equipment has been decontaminated is important. Any kind of treatment that gives you some additional sterilization of a mask would be of value to the people who have to wear them all the time."" The study,""Addressing personal protective equipment (PPE) decontamination: Methylene blue and light inactivates severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on N95 respirators and medical masks with maintenance of integrity and fit,"" was published in the journal Infection Control & Hospital Epidemiology .

But at least there should not be too many three-cornered contests as it will be detrimental to all parties.""Therefore we must have consensus, InsyaAllah there will be a way out,"" he told reporters after officiating the PAS Selangor Building in Section 13 here last night.Tuan Ibrahim said the three parties needed to focus on winning the state assembly seats which had not yet been won by PAS, Umno or Bersatu in Melaka.Meanwhile, Tuan Ibrahim said PAS intended to contest five seats in Melaka, but it had yet to be finalised.""PAS intends to contest five seats in Melaka and I mentioned to Umno deputy president Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan that we will not take Umno seats.""We have 28 seats in Melaka where Umno has 13 or 14 seats.

Caught for Catching ‘Em All: Feds Say Georgia Man Spent Covid Aid on Pokémon Cards,https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/pokemon-cards-covid-aid-georgia-man-wire-fraud-charge-1247643/,"['Culture', 'Culture News', 'covid-19', 'Pokemon']",['Jon Blistein'],,"Vinath Oudomsine accused of wire fraud for lying on aid application, spending over $50,000 on trading cards",,2021-10-25 19:45:17,"A Georgia man is facing a wire fraud charge for using Covid-19 relief money to allegedly purchase over $55,000 worth of Pokémon cards. Prosecutors in the Southern District of Georgia accused Vinath Oudomsine of lying on an application for an Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL), one of a handful of small relief programs overseen by the Small Business Administration during the pandemic. The money was supposed to be used to cover various business and operating expenses, and prosecutors claim that not only did Oudomsine lie on his application, but the money he did receive primarily went towards trading cards anyway. Lawyers for Oudomsine declined to comment. A representative for prosecutors overseeing the case also declined to comment. According to court documents obtained by Rolling Stone , prosecutors allege that Oudomsine filed his SBA loan application on July 14, 2020 for a business he claimed had been around since 2018. Oudomsine claimed on the application that he had 10 employees and 12-month gross revenues of $235,000. About a month later, in Aug. 2020, Oudomsine’s EIDL application earned him an $85,000 deposit from the Small Business Administration. At the top of 2021, prosecutors claim, Oudomsine used that money to drop a whopping $57,789 on Pokémon cards — about 68% of the total sum he received. Alas, there was nothing in the court documents to answer such lingering and pressing questions like, was Oudomsine buying troves of packs, or individual cards? If the latter, which ones did he get? Fingers crossed all the juicy details will come out in discovery. (And yes, if you’re wondering, it is very easy to spend over $50,000 on even just one Pokémon card.) Oudomsine is scheduled to appear in court this Thursday, Oct. 28. The wire fraud charge carries a max sentence of up to 20 years in federal prison and $250,000 in fines.",,rollingstone

KUCHING, Oct 26 ― Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture Datuk Seri Abdul Karim Rahman Hamzah calls for no open campaign and no open rally to facilitate the next Sarawak election.“No open campaigning or no open rally does not mean that democracy is curtailed,” the Parti Pesaka Bumiputera Bersatu (PBB) vice president said.Abdul Karim pointed out that there are other ways and means candidates in election can promote themselves, especially in this digital era.“We have seen what had happened in Sabah after they held their snap state election (in September 2020),” said the Asajaya assemblyman.“In view of Sarawak having to undergo a state election soon, it is advisable for the Election Commission (or SPR) to find ways to make sure that the ‘mistakes’ made during last Sabah state election are not repeated,” he added.Abdul Karim was reacting to the latest comment by Minister of Health Khairy Jamaluddin that no election-related social gatherings or activities are allowed to facilitate the coming Melaka snap state election in order to reduce Covid-19 infection among people there.Khairy said the order is to take effect yesterday (October 25) until November 27, 2021.When contacted yesterday, Parti Rakyat Sarawak (PRS) secretary-general Dato Janang Bungsu said he agreed with Khairy.“Agree that it should be within the stipulated standard operating procedures (SOPs). After all, we are yet to come out from Covid-19 problem. Stringent SOPs must be observed to minimise physical contact,” added Janang.Progressive Democratic Party (PDP) vice president Datu Dr Penguang Manggil however said it would still be premature now to talk about SOPs for Sarawak election which is being stalled as the state is under the Emergency Order (EO) until its expiry on February 1, 2022.“The SOPs mentioned therein are for Melaka, during this given time and circumstances. It may be relevant to be imposed in Melaka but may or may not be necessary for Sarawak,” said the Assistant Minister of Housing and Local Government.“It is also too premature to talk about the SOPs as we have to know when the Emergency is to be lifted and the State Legislative Assembly (DUN) is to be dissolved.“I am pretty confident that the Ministry of Health (MoH), State Health Department, the SPR and the Sarawak Disaster Management Committee will be duly consulted and SOP formulated, taking all factors and any emerging issues before the decision to call for the PRN12 (12th Sarawak election) is made,” said Penguang, who is also Marudi assemblyman.Khairy had said in a media statement on October 24: “Based on the monitoring by the Ministry of Health, among the contributors to the increase in cases and Covid-19 clusters in the country were related to the activities of gatherings or social gatherings that did not comply with the standard operating procedures (SOPs).”The MoH expected that similar activities will take place leading up to the Melaka state election on November 20, he said.“As the risk of Covid-19 infection is still high, especially with the spread of the Delta variant in the community, and the increasing number of new Covid-19 cases which have been reported, such activities will further increase the risk of Covid-19 infection within the community,” he said.Last Monday, the SPR set November 8 as the nomination date for the Melaka state election while the voting date is November 20.Khairy explained that this ban is in line with the list of unauthorised activities (negative list) in the latest SOPs for states under Phase 4 of the National Recovery Plan (PPN).Talks are rife in Sarawak that nomination day and polling day for the state election are slated for Nov 13 and Nov 27 respectively if the Yang di-Pertuan Agong wishes to repeal the EO earlier than its expiry date. ― Borneo Post",2021-10-25 23:28:05,,,malaymail

Kingsbury tested positive for COVID-19 on Oct. 15 and missed the Cardinals' 37-14 victory last week over the Cleveland Browns. Kingsbury took three tests that day and a fourth early on Oct. 16 to confirm the diagnosis, a source told ESPN. The third-year coach was asymptomatic throughout, the source said. To return, Kingsbury needed two negative tests 24 hours apart. His first one was Saturday morning and his second was early Sunday. After his first negative test Saturday, there was a strong belief that Kingsbury would be back on the sideline as Arizona looks to improve to 7-0. Even though Kingsbury, who is vaccinated, was relegated to his home for eight days while he waited to test negative, he was still doing ""everything"" he would normally do as the head coach, said defensive coordinator Vance Joseph, who took over some of Kingsbury's head-coaching duties such as meeting with the media. ""Obviously, the offensive game plan, and he's obviously built that this week,"" Joseph said. ""There's been a bunch of virtual meetings with offensive staff and the entire staff, obviously. So nothing's changed as far as who is building the game plan right now, and it's Kliff.""",https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2021/0908/r906330_1296x729_16-9.jpg,espn

In a statement on Monday, Merck said the EU drug regulator had started an expedited licensing process for molnupiravir. If given the green light, it would be the first treatment for COVID-19 that does not need to be administered through needles or intravenous infusions. Earlier this month, Merck asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to OK molnupiravir, and a decision is expected within weeks. The company reported this month that the pill cut hospitalizations and deaths by half among patients with early symptoms of COVID-19. The results were so strong that independent medical experts monitoring the trial recommended stopping it early. An antiviral pill that people could take at home to reduce their symptoms and speed recovery could prove groundbreaking, easing the crushing caseload on hospitals and helping to curb outbreaks in poorer countries with weak health care systems. It would also bolster a two-pronged approach to the pandemic: treatment, by way of medication, and prevention, primarily through vaccinations. The Associated Press",,richmond-news

The survey was released on Monday and included 680 parents of children five to 11. On Tuesday, FDA senior officials are meant to hold a discussion on whether to approve the vaccine for this age cohort. Specifically, the survey showed that 48% of parents are sure or think they will get their kids the jab, 23% will definitely not vaccinate their children and 29% are still undecided. ""Right now, when morbidity is not high, it is important to get children as early as possible to prevent or reduce the next wave,” said Meuhedet Chief Nursing Officer Mali Kusha. Among those who said they will not vaccinate their children, 37% said it is due to concerns that the vaccine could have negative health impacts on their kid in the long run. Some 18% said they feel they are lacking evidence on the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine. Also, 11% said they simply don’t want their child vaccinated, while 7% said they assume their child will catch the virus and then be naturally protected. Kusha said that more than one-third of parents said they would consult with their pediatrician about vaccination and another 23% said they are waiting to read articles on the subject. “We have no doubt that extensive information is required here both in the media and through pediatricians who have direct and continuous contact with families,” Kusha said. The Meuhedet survey is one of a few surveys conducted in recent weeks ahead of the pending decision by the FDA. A WOMAN RECEIVES her third anti-COVID vaccination at a Clalit Health Fund center in Jerusalem. (credit: MARC ISRAEL SELLEM/THE JERUSALEM POST) A survey completed at the beginning of this month by Bar-Ilan University found that the majority (57%) of Jewish Israeli parents of children five to11 will get their children vaccinated if the FDA approves the vaccine. The survey was carried out by Dr. Liora Shmueli of the school’s Program for Public Health and Health Systems Management and included a representative sample of 894 of the country’s Jewish parents. Some 27% of parents said they would vaccinate their kids within less than one month of the jab being available, and 27% said they would vaccinate within one to three months. The rest said that they would wait four months to more than a year, or that they would not vaccinate their children at all. Briefing documents released over the weekend by FDA scientists indicated they are likely to approve the vaccine for this age cohort. In the documents, it said that the scientists believe the likely benefits of giving the Pfizer vaccine to young children outweigh the risks. If the FDA votes favorably, the Centers for Disease Control will meet on November 2-3 to make its recommendations on how the shots should be administered. Israel is expected to follow and approve the shots a few weeks later.",,jpost
How this Oklahoma ranch is using nuclear families to upend the foster care system,https://www.deseret.com/2021/10/24/22661072/how-this-oklahoma-ranch-is-using-nuclear-families-to-upend-the-foster-care-system-peppers-ranch,,['Naomi Schaefer Riley'],,,"Photo Illustration by Alex Cochran, Deseret News Most often sibling groups are either separated or tend to languish in foster care. Peppers Ranch is changing that Desie’s eyes grow wide as she looks over the menu at Cattlemen’s Steakhouse, a popular destination with tourists, local families and even cowboys in the Stockyards area outside of Oklahoma City. The 8-year-old Desie does not get to go out for dinner often — the nine other children in her family make that logistically and financially challenging — but that does not stop this soon-to-be third grader from sharing her adventurous tastes. “I’m going to start with the shrimp cocktail,” she announces to the half of our group of 14 sitting at one table. Desie came to stay with Ashlee and Matt Terry when she was 8 days old. It was part of a “Home for the Holidays” emergency placement. Desie came to the Terrys right after Thanksgiving in 2012 while child welfare services figured out what to do with her; she never left. Desie was actually the fourth child placed with the Terrys. Their first placements were in 2011 — sisters Evie and Piper — and then their biological sister Bella a few months later. In 2014, with four daughters, three bedrooms and only one shower, they decided they did not have the space for more. Ashlee recalls: “I said that when God provided more bathrooms, we would reopen our home.” God seemed to answer their prayer when they were offered a spot at Peppers Ranch, a community in Guthrie, about 30 minutes from Oklahoma City. The ranch harnesses an old-fashioned understanding of family, neighborhood and community to solve the problems of a new generation of displaced children. Opened in 2002, with the donation of 160 acres of land, Peppers Ranch was originally a residential facility for abused and neglected boys. The donor, Hal French, a local oil and gas entrepreneur, had grown up near a boys home and often played with the children there, and wanted to create a similar opportunity for more kids. After a few years, things seemed to be going OK for the boys who came to Peppers Ranch. But their sisters were just being dropped off at a local shelter. The girls had no equivalent and, more importantly, the siblings were losing their connection to one another. Which got French and the other folks at Peppers Ranch to thinking. According to research from Casey Family Programs, “approximately two-thirds of children in foster care have a sibling in care, and yet — despite the benefits of joint sibling placements — it is estimated that more than 70% of children with siblings are separated from one or more of their siblings while in care.” Benefits of placing siblings together include lower incidence of behavioral problems and a higher chance they will both like and adapt to their foster homes and have better academic performance. But finding foster or adoptive families that have the capacity to take in sibling groups is hard. Even if parents have an extra bed in their home or are willing to take in two siblings, what are the chances they have the space (let alone the time and energy) to take in three or four? The result is that sibling groups are either separated or tend to languish in foster care for longer. And so Peppers Ranch tried something different. In 2009, after extensive studies, the leadership decided to move to a family model, offering couples who were already licensed to do foster care in Oklahoma the opportunity to move to Peppers Ranch. There they could live in one of the newly built houses, paying only a couple of hundred dollars in rent and receiving a small stipend in addition to what the state offered for foster care, if they were willing to open their home to at least five foster children. Today, there are 16 homes on the property (with plans to build a few more over the next few years), all more than 3,000 square feet. The typical home has four bedrooms, a large living area and an industrial-size kitchen and pantry. The more recent homes even have hookups for two washers and dryers as well as larger garages in which families can park their super-size vans. The entire community has an annual budget of about $1.5 million, all from private donations. In addition to money, locals also donate furniture, clothing and other necessities. Hundreds of volunteers help maintain the grounds and run programs for the kids. Spark Creative One of the homes Peppers Ranch provides to its foster families. Set amid farmlands at the end of a dirt road which is prone to flooding, the community may seem inconvenient to some, but for the families at Peppers Ranch, it offers everything they need. The landscape feels a little sparse — not enough time has passed for many trees to mature on the land. Each family has a backyard, equipped with all the trampolines and play structures you would find in a typical suburban neighborhood. There is also a community basketball court and soccer field, a playground and pool complex, a pond where the kids can fish, and a barn with 17 horses. The horses, many of which are older and have been donated in their retirement, are used for equestrian therapy. They are gentle and the kids enjoy helping to care for them. Indeed, one of the Peppers Ranch mothers told me how excited her 6-year-old adoptive son was when he was given his very own pooper scooper for the horses. “They need my help,” he would tell his mother before running over to the barn. Each family also has to help with chores around the community — including feeding the horses over a weekend when the trainer is not around. The logistics of being a foster parent, especially with multiple children in the home, can be overwhelming. Multiple therapy appointments a week, in addition to arranging visitation with biological parents, meetings with social workers and court dates can make even the most organized person’s head spin. But Peppers Ranch brings at least some of those services to the community. There is a learning center where children can receive after-school tutoring. The ranch also offers art therapy, dance therapy, a swim team and a variety of other extracurricular activities. Parents pay a small fee for these out of the stipends they receive. The community requires at least one parent to work full time. But the subsidized housing at Peppers Ranch means one parent can stay home full time — and most of the time they do. With so many kids, especially ones who have behavioral and emotional challenges, it is hard to outsource child care. But the state stipends do not allow a typical middle-class foster family to give up one income. In families with older kids, mothers sometimes have part-time jobs they can do from home during school hours. Mostly it’s the mothers at home but in at least one case it’s the father who cares for the children while the mother works as a hospital nurse. Whoever stays home, the arrangement is a relief for parents. Dustin Burpo, a family pastor at a nearby church and a parent at Peppers Ranch, tells me that he and his wife recently looked at their budget. “We’ve got a house to stay in, a nice house that has plenty of space for our large capacity living” — the Burpos have eight children — “It truly gives you that peace of mind. It’s a weight off my shoulders, knowing that I’ve got a place for my kids.” But it’s not just the homes. It’s the community. Most of the families give their kids freedom to roam. Matt Terry says that’s one of the things he likes about Peppers Ranch, that it feels like a more old-fashioned neighborhood. It’s certainly true that it’s small enough for everyone to know everyone else. Shelly Blankenship, who has been at Peppers Ranch since 2011 and fostered around 80 children here, compares it to when she grew up across the street from her grandmother and down the street from her aunt. “You couldn’t get away with anything.” When she sees kids misbehaving at Peppers Ranch, she will say, “I don’t think you need to be doing that.” They will ask if she is going to tell their mother. Her response? “Do I need to tell her? If you’re going to quit and act right, then I don’t have to tell her anything. We’ve already taken care of it.” Even if they lived in such a neighborhood today, though, parents of foster children and children adopted out of foster care often have a much more difficult calculation about giving their children freedom. Should you let a kid wander around a neighborhood knowing that they have been traumatized by other adults? Are there psychological and behavioral problems that could pop up if something scares them or surprises them? How will other adults respond? Will their fellow parents blame them if something goes wrong? And this is really the genius of Peppers Ranch. It is a supportive community filled with other children who have gone through similar things and other adults who are trying to help those children. While many of the families at Peppers Ranch have found some level of support for their foster care efforts among friends and family, they often felt isolated before they came here. “You have behaviors for a child and you think that something is wrong with me as a parent,” says Kristin Burpo, Dustin’s wife. “You just feel judged, even in a church community,” she tells me. At Peppers Ranch, veteran parents often serve as mentors to the newer ones. The mothers meet at least once a month to talk about the issues that they are facing with their children, where to find resources to help, how to deal with the emotional toll that fostering is taking on them, their marriages, and even their other children. Most research shows that about half of all foster parents quit within their first year. Kristin Martinez understands why. Martinez, who has one biological child and seven adopted children, remembers the day she took in a 16-year-old girl. “I never had a teenager before. I could immediately go to other neighbors and they were able to provide me with great information and great resources.” Her children are playing in the backyard when I arrive, but then come in and sit down with us, periodically asking when it will be time to go get snow cones. She also describes the other trials of being a foster parent, including the “heartbreak” of having a child leave after a long time to go back to their biological family. She asks me to imagine having a child live with you for a year or more, having him or her become part of your children’s lives and then never seeing them again. Or what about “when you’re going through the heartbreak of going to all the court dates”? Martinez recalls “the heartbreak of the biological parents never getting it together. Witnessing the heartbreak that happens to your child. It’s a very emotional roller coaster, this life.” A couple of her older kids nod in agreement. She finds it reassuring that “there’s somebody here to understand that. When you’re having a really hard day and you’re in tears because it’s so hard,” she says, it means so much to her “to have people that literally understand exactly what you’re going through. … To have people that you can do this life with is pretty special.” There is also a network of support for children who live at Peppers Ranch and did not come from foster care. Few people can understand the journey of biological children whose parents keep bringing new children into the home. As Shelly Blankenship acknowledges, “My kids weren’t from trauma, but I put trauma in their lives.” But being at Peppers Ranch has helped her children process that. Rather than putting all this emotional chaos behind her, her daughter, who is now 25, has guardianship over a 17-year-old in the system. Kristin Burpo appreciates that her children see “unconditional love” in her home and in the other homes at Peppers Ranch. “This is always my prayer, that they would see my heart in all of it. And no matter the child that comes in my home, they’re my child when they’re in my home.” Memory McElhaney The Burpo family enjoys some time on the beach. During COVID-19, the community created its own bubble. The kids would still play with each other, going on field trips to state parks some days. The moms would get together, pick up some food and sit in one of their vans to get a break from the kids. “We did that once a week just to try to keep our sanity,” Kristin recalls. The Burpos had two biological children when they took in Shanaya, their first foster child from a family that her husband’s brother (a pastor) knew from his church. Even in a community that was welcoming, she worried that their children might stick out. “Our daughter is black and we are white. It was a little bit awkward” in the small town they lived in before Peppers Ranch. “Coming out here, we know that Shanaya would grow up not feeling odd. Coming to a community where everybody was accepted the way they were because it was just normal. … That was really big for us.” Since moving to Peppers Ranch, they have adopted two sets of siblings: Shakota, 8, Sky, 7, and Trinity, 6; and JC, 4, and Keisha, 3. When I visit their house the chaos is controlled. Kristin is folding laundry. The older kids have helped the younger kids get their sandwiches for lunch and they are passing around the largest container of cheese balls I have ever seen. Three of the younger kids go to watch cartoons when they are done. The family has just come back from a vacation Bible school camp and they are trying to get back into a routine. Dustin, their father, is a pastor at a church about 40 minutes away. Peppers Ranch is not a faith-based organization but every one of the families there is guided in some way by their religious beliefs. Ashley Hahn, the director of the ranch, says they have all “felt called through faith to this walk.” She tells me, “I’m a person of faith. I don’t know how you could do it without knowing the Lord is on your side.” Most of the Burpo kids ignore me, but one of the girls takes me on a grand tour of the house, showing me what’s inside of each of the closets, introducing me to the cat. She seems to crave attention in a way that would be typical for an outgoing 7-year-old. And she clearly enjoys showing off for guests. But then she starts taking watermelon rinds out of the garbage and chewing on them. When Dustin notices, he is calm but firm, asking her to stop. After she does it again, he takes her aside, offering a sterner but still completely calm warning. The kids, as Kristin explains to me over the third basket of laundry, have all manner of diagnoses. A number were born with drugs in their systems. Others watched their parents physically abuse each other and experienced severe neglect as they were shuttled back and forth among parents too strung out to care for them and grandparents who were overwhelmed. Providing a stable environment with love and clear boundaries is important, but the Burpos have tried to consider in other ways how they parent. Almost everyone at Peppers Ranch has been through training in how to deal with kids who have experienced trauma. Dustin also says he talks to other fathers at the ranch about their unique role. Many of the kids have no responsible adult male in their lives. “We are fathers to the fatherless.” Dustin, who counts himself lucky for growing up with a father and a stepfather, says he fears for these kids, many of whom “don’t know who their biological father is and they probably never will know. I get to fill that role. And it’s very humbling and scary at the same time.” Peppers Ranch families think about the building blocks of a normal family and how to re-create them for kids who have come out of dysfunctional homes. Kristin has seen up close how vital it is for sibling groups to stay together. It’s difficult for younger kids because they want to have at least one of the older people they look up to present in their lives. But “when it’s an older child taking care of a younger child and then they are split, … the older child was the caretaker and then they have no purpose.” Ashlee and Matt met doing a training offered by the Oklahoma Department of Health Services. She was training to be a caseworker, helping foster children find permanency. He was training to be a child abuse investigator. It wasn’t long before they were married and began taking in foster children themselves. Matt says that Ashlee is the one in charge of all the logistics of the family and making sure everything works, but it’s clear that his experience working with this population of children has driven him here as well. In his first few months on the job, he discovered three dead children. It was during the rise of meth labs in the area a few years ago. “We didn’t know what we were stepping into.” At dinner with the Terry family at Cattlemen’s, the dynamics of the siblings seems both happy and familiar. Their oldest son, Jose, who is 18 and just finished high school, took his younger brother to the bathroom more than once during dinner and helped him order food. In addition to Dessie, the Terrys have adopted one set of three sisters and another set of five brothers and sisters and are fostering the nephew of the five, born to an older sister who is an adult. Jose is living at home while he is enrolled in local vocational training program. He says he wants to become and electrician and move to Las Vegas. Ashlee, who took him to Vegas for his 18th birthday and celebrated with him by getting tattoos together, jokes that with all those lights there should plenty for him to do. His next youngest sister listens excitedly and talks about her plans for the future, too. She has multiple babysitting jobs and likes caring for children but is also thinking about cosmetology. When we sit down, the kids divide themselves more by age than by their families of origin. But the fact that they are with the people they grew up with seems to set them at ease. Certainly dinner with 10 kids turns out to be much more serene than you might expect. Despite having to wait over an hour for a table — by which point my own children would be losing their minds — these children were patient and kind, asking their parents polite questions and making conversation with me and DaNysha Wright, the programs and outreach director for Peppers Ranch. When 17-year-old Aurelia asks DaNysha whether she would ever foster or adopt herself, she looks around the table smiling. Desie takes advantage of her moment of hesitation to explain, “I think you need to find a man first!” In some ways, Peppers Ranch has a sort of artificial feel. The current families have to meet with potential new families and decide whether they should be able to move in. Families can only stay in the community as long as their homes are open to foster children, even if only on a temporary basis. A number of families have ended their foster care “journeys” after a few years and children from other homes talk about missing their friends. Of course, this could happen in any neighborhood. Ashlee Terry Children play on the property of Peppers Ranch. Peppers Ranch does try to provide continuity for kids in other ways. They have a “Grandma” program, in which older people who have either moved on from fostering or who simply want to help out, can live in one of a few small apartments in the community. They form their own relationships with the kids, inviting them over to bake cookies or help with homework. They host playdates for the little ones to give the moms a break and organize art projects for the older kids. One of the new grandmas, Kim Magallanes, moved here from California after her son and daughter-in-law came a few years ago. She is retired but filled with energy and has started to build relationships with the kids. She also has experience with horses and plans to help out in the barn as well. She keeps a stash of carrots in her refrigerator in case one of the kids comes by and wants to go feed them. Kim remembers when she was a child “going to my grandparents’ house, things that I now realize were chores, were fun. Hanging clothes on the line and picking berries and learning how to bake.” Being a grandmother at Peppers Ranch is “just being another person these kids can hang out with.” She’s taking a group of the teenagers on a trip to a camp a few hours away a couple of days after we meet. Other communities have attempted to harness the power and time of an older generation to build connections with foster children. In an article called “It Takes a Multigenerational Village to Raise Foster Kids” the authors who work at an organization called Hope Meadows describe how they have created communities in which foster families live in close proximity to older adults. The programs, which are funded in part with public dollars, offer “intergenerational art and other classes, weekly community dinners, and a community garden, where young and older residents can meet and strengthen ties.” Indeed, such communities are part of a larger conversation we seem to be having in this country about the need for more communal support to raise all children. Last year, David Brooks penned an article for The Atlantic arguing that the nuclear family had failed us. He bemoaned the loss of extended families and tightly-connected neighborhoods, suggesting that “forged families” are the future, people who may not be related by blood, but have chosen to live in community. A New Yorker article on communal living among adults focuses on arrangements like Treehouse Hollywood, which author Nathan Heller describes as “a space for community living, where people of many ages and from many walks of life eat together, spend time together, and conduct their lives largely in common view.” At least one young single mother who was interviewed says she found support for her child rearing with the other adults there. As Brooks writes: “Americans are hungering to live in extended and forged families, in ways that are new and ancient at the same time. This is a significant opportunity, a chance to thicken and broaden family relationships, a chance to allow more adults and children to live and grow under the loving gaze of a dozen pairs of eyes, and be caught, when they fall, by a dozen pairs of arms.” There are certainly a dozen arms waiting to catch the kids at Peppers Ranch, but they are primarily being cared for by nuclear families. Each couple makes decisions about bringing children into their family — each contracts with the state of Oklahoma separately to care for these kids. They have different rules for their children make different decisions about where to send their children to school and how much to involve themselves with other families in the community. They take different vacations and attend different camps. Each couple is guided by their own faith and attend a variety of churches. These children have often come from environments where there were a dozen pairs of arms — parents, grandmothers, aunts, neighbors — but none of them were responsible or capable enough to be the children’s primary caretakers, which is how they ended up in foster care in the first place. Peppers Ranch is built on a different notion — that children need two parents, including in most cases one who works and one who is at home, and the presence of their biological siblings if possible. These family units can certainly stand to benefit from the support of others in the community — the grandmothers, the other fathers and mothers in the same position, the counselors and therapists and learning specialists — but the family is the thing. Naomi Schaefer Riley is a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a Deseret News contributor and the author of “No Way to Treat a Child: How the Foster Care System, Family Courts, and Racial Activists Are Wrecking Young Lives.”",2021-10-25 04:24:04,"Desie’s eyes grow wide as she looks over the menu at Cattlemen’s Steakhouse, a popular destination with tourists, local families and even cowboys in the Stockyards area outside of Oklahoma City. The 8-year-old Desie does not get to go out for dinner often — the nine other children in her family make that logistically and financially challenging — but that does not stop this soon-to-be third grader from sharing her adventurous tastes. “I’m going to start with the shrimp cocktail,” she announces to the half of our group of 14 sitting at one table. Desie came to stay with Ashlee and Matt Terry when she was 8 days old. It was part of a “Home for the Holidays” emergency placement. Desie came to the Terrys right after Thanksgiving in 2012 while child welfare services figured out what to do with her; she never left. Desie was actually the fourth child placed with the Terrys. Their first placements were in 2011 — sisters Evie and Piper — and then their biological sister Bella a few months later. In 2014, with four daughters, three bedrooms and only one shower, they decided they did not have the space for more. Ashlee recalls: “I said that when God provided more bathrooms, we would reopen our home.” God seemed to answer their prayer when they were offered a spot at Peppers Ranch, a community in Guthrie, about 30 minutes from Oklahoma City. The ranch harnesses an old-fashioned understanding of family, neighborhood and community to solve the problems of a new generation of displaced children. Opened in 2002, with the donation of 160 acres of land, Peppers Ranch was originally a residential facility for abused and neglected boys. The donor, Hal French, a local oil and gas entrepreneur, had grown up near a boys home and often played with the children there, and wanted to create a similar opportunity for more kids. After a few years, things seemed to be going OK for the boys who came to Peppers Ranch. But their sisters were just being dropped off at a local shelter. The girls had no equivalent and, more importantly, the siblings were losing their connection to one another. Which got French and the other folks at Peppers Ranch to thinking. According to research from Casey Family Programs, “approximately two-thirds of children in foster care have a sibling in care, and yet — despite the benefits of joint sibling placements — it is estimated that more than 70% of children with siblings are separated from one or more of their siblings while in care.” Benefits of placing siblings together include lower incidence of behavioral problems and a higher chance they will both like and adapt to their foster homes and have better academic performance. Related She outgrew foster care, but the hardship didn’t stop there But finding foster or adoptive families that have the capacity to take in sibling groups is hard. Even if parents have an extra bed in their home or are willing to take in two siblings, what are the chances they have the space (let alone the time and energy) to take in three or four? The result is that sibling groups are either separated or tend to languish in foster care for longer. And so Peppers Ranch tried something different. In 2009, after extensive studies, the leadership decided to move to a family model, offering couples who were already licensed to do foster care in Oklahoma the opportunity to move to Peppers Ranch. There they could live in one of the newly built houses, paying only a couple of hundred dollars in rent and receiving a small stipend in addition to what the state offered for foster care, if they were willing to open their home to at least five foster children. Today, there are 16 homes on the property (with plans to build a few more over the next few years), all more than 3,000 square feet. The typical home has four bedrooms, a large living area and an industrial-size kitchen and pantry. The more recent homes even have hookups for two washers and dryers as well as larger garages in which families can park their super-size vans. The entire community has an annual budget of about $1.5 million, all from private donations. In addition to money, locals also donate furniture, clothing and other necessities. Hundreds of volunteers help maintain the grounds and run programs for the kids. One of the homes Peppers Ranch provides to its foster families. Spark Creative Set amid farmlands at the end of a dirt road which is prone to flooding, the community may seem inconvenient to some, but for the families at Peppers Ranch, it offers everything they need. The landscape feels a little sparse — not enough time has passed for many trees to mature on the land. Each family has a backyard, equipped with all the trampolines and play structures you would find in a typical suburban neighborhood. There is also a community basketball court and soccer field, a playground and pool complex, a pond where the kids can fish, and a barn with 17 horses. The horses, many of which are older and have been donated in their retirement, are used for equestrian therapy. They are gentle and the kids enjoy helping to care for them. Indeed, one of the Peppers Ranch mothers told me how excited her 6-year-old adoptive son was when he was given his very own pooper scooper for the horses. “They need my help,” he would tell his mother before running over to the barn. Each family also has to help with chores around the community — including feeding the horses over a weekend when the trainer is not around. The logistics of being a foster parent, especially with multiple children in the home, can be overwhelming. Multiple therapy appointments a week, in addition to arranging visitation with biological parents, meetings with social workers and court dates can make even the most organized person’s head spin. But Peppers Ranch brings at least some of those services to the community. There is a learning center where children can receive after-school tutoring. The ranch also offers art therapy, dance therapy, a swim team and a variety of other extracurricular activities. Parents pay a small fee for these out of the stipends they receive. The community requires at least one parent to work full time. But the subsidized housing at Peppers Ranch means one parent can stay home full time — and most of the time they do. With so many kids, especially ones who have behavioral and emotional challenges, it is hard to outsource child care. But the state stipends do not allow a typical middle-class foster family to give up one income. In families with older kids, mothers sometimes have part-time jobs they can do from home during school hours. Mostly it’s the mothers at home but in at least one case it’s the father who cares for the children while the mother works as a hospital nurse. Whoever stays home, the arrangement is a relief for parents. Dustin Burpo, a family pastor at a nearby church and a parent at Peppers Ranch, tells me that he and his wife recently looked at their budget. “We’ve got a house to stay in, a nice house that has plenty of space for our large capacity living” — the Burpos have eight children — “It truly gives you that peace of mind. It’s a weight off my shoulders, knowing that I’ve got a place for my kids.” But it’s not just the homes. It’s the community. Most of the families give their kids freedom to roam. Matt Terry says that’s one of the things he likes about Peppers Ranch, that it feels like a more old-fashioned neighborhood. It’s certainly true that it’s small enough for everyone to know everyone else. Shelly Blankenship, who has been at Peppers Ranch since 2011 and fostered around 80 children here, compares it to when she grew up across the street from her grandmother and down the street from her aunt. “You couldn’t get away with anything.” When she sees kids misbehaving at Peppers Ranch, she will say, “I don’t think you need to be doing that.” They will ask if she is going to tell their mother. Her response? “Do I need to tell her? If you’re going to quit and act right, then I don’t have to tell her anything. We’ve already taken care of it.” Even if they lived in such a neighborhood today, though, parents of foster children and children adopted out of foster care often have a much more difficult calculation about giving their children freedom. Should you let a kid wander around a neighborhood knowing that they have been traumatized by other adults? Are there psychological and behavioral problems that could pop up if something scares them or surprises them? How will other adults respond? Will their fellow parents blame them if something goes wrong? Related Opinion: Religious foster care plays a vital role for our most vulnerable children And this is really the genius of Peppers Ranch. It is a supportive community filled with other children who have gone through similar things and other adults who are trying to help those children. While many of the families at Peppers Ranch have found some level of support for their foster care efforts among friends and family, they often felt isolated before they came here. “You have behaviors for a child and you think that something is wrong with me as a parent,” says Kristin Burpo, Dustin’s wife. “You just feel judged, even in a church community,” she tells me.

This is a significant opportunity, a chance to thicken and broaden family relationships, a chance to allow more adults and children to live and grow under the loving gaze of a dozen pairs of eyes, and be caught, when they fall, by a dozen pairs of arms.” There are certainly a dozen arms waiting to catch the kids at Peppers Ranch, but they are primarily being cared for by nuclear families. Each couple makes decisions about bringing children into their family — each contracts with the state of Oklahoma separately to care for these kids. They have different rules for their children make different decisions about where to send their children to school and how much to involve themselves with other families in the community. They take different vacations and attend different camps. Each couple is guided by their own faith and attend a variety of churches. These children have often come from environments where there were a dozen pairs of arms — parents, grandmothers, aunts, neighbors — but none of them were responsible or capable enough to be the children’s primary caretakers, which is how they ended up in foster care in the first place. Peppers Ranch is built on a different notion — that children need two parents, including in most cases one who works and one who is at home, and the presence of their biological siblings if possible. These family units can certainly stand to benefit from the support of others in the community — the grandmothers, the other fathers and mothers in the same position, the counselors and therapists and learning specialists — but the family is the thing.

New Jersey Republican gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli joined "" Tucker Carlson Tonight "" on Monday to respond to Gov. Philip Murphy's taxation policies and previous comments about whether the consideration that his socioeconomic lockdown orders violated the Constitution might be ""above my pay grade."" Host Tucker Carlson reminded the audience of Murphy's last appearance on the program in April 2020 -- when New Jersey and its surrounding Democrat-run states instituted sweeping mandates against religious or family gatherings and operations of businesses like gyms and restaurants . In April 2020, Carlson asked Murphy about a case in which 15 men were arrested for congregating at a Lakewood, N.J., synagogue for the funeral of Orthodox Rabbi Chaim Moshe Strulovics in violation of his executive order banning large gatherings. 'The Bill of Rights, as you well know, protects Americans' rights — enshrines their right to practice their religion as they see fit and to congregate together to assemble peacefully,"" Carlson said. ""By what authority did you nullify the Bill of Rights in issuing this order? How do you have the power to do that?"" ""That's above my pay grade, Tucker,"" Murphy responded. ""I wasn't thinking of the Bill of Rights when we did this ... we looked at all the data and the science and it says people have to stay away from each other. That is the best thing we can do to break the back of the curve of this virus, that leads to lower hospitalization and ultimately fatalities.""

(AP Photo/Stefan Jeremiah) In response, Ciattarelli said that while Democrats hold about a 1 million voter advantage in the Garden State, many New Jersey Democrats are ""fiscally conservative and socially moderate."" ""This guy is just way too extreme,"" he said, noting that no Democratic governor has been reelected in the state since Gov. Brendan Byrne in the late 1970s. Carlson went on to compare Murphy to former Gov. Jim Florio, a Democrat of the early 1990s whose plan to hike taxes in the billions upset so many New Jersey voters that they responded by giving Republicans their first legislative majority in Trenton in decades. ""Phil Murphy has done the same thing [as Jim Florio], he's gone way too far left,"" replied Ciattarelli, formerly a state lawmaker and county freeholder from Somerset. ""A year and a half ago on this very show, [Murphy claimed] ‘the Bill of Rights is above my pay grade’. -- It’s not funny. But worse than that, he told the highest taxed people in the nation ‘ if taxes are issue, we are probably not your state ’."" Incumbent Gov.

The deadline for all health-care workers in the province to be fully vaccinated is Tuesday. Horgan says the majority of health-care workers are immunized and often perplexed about why others wouldn't follow the science behind vaccination and the advice of provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry. The vaccine mandate will apply to everyone who works in health-care settings, including students, doctors, contractors and volunteers. Those who don't have their first dose by the deadline can't work unless they have a recognized medical exemption. Workers who get their first shot before Nov. 15 can resume working seven days after the first dose, but they must wear personal protective equipment and take other precautions until they have their second dose, which must be no more than 35 days after the initial dose. Staff at long-term care homes and assisted living facilities needed to be fully vaccinated by Oct. 12. British Columbia is reporting 1,618 new cases of COVID-19, 20 deaths and five new health-care facility outbreaks over the last three days.

Post-Covid EV industry surge anticipated,https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/2204179/post-covid-ev-industry-surge-anticipated,,,,"Startups venturing into electric vehicle (EV) businesses expect to see rapid post-pandemic growth of the industry, with more charging facilities and EV-sharing service platforms to serve new urban lifestyles.",,2021-10-25 21:00:00,"Startups venturing into electric vehicle (EV) businesses expect to see rapid post-pandemic growth of the industry, with more charging facilities and EV-sharing service platforms to serve new urban lifestyles. As the world is alert to more serious efforts to cope with global warming, caused by greenhouse gases particularly from the transport sector, the age of battery-run vehicles, which emit zero carbon dioxide and other pollutants, is set to soon become a reality. Over the next three years, the global automotive industry will be part of significant changes towards more sustainable and environmentally friendly development, a key component of the ""Great Reset"" coined by the World Economic Forum, said Soranun Choochut, co-founder and chief executive of Etran (Thailand) Co, a Bangkok-based electric motorcycle developer. The Covid-19 pandemic, which has made people more aware of healthcare, has also fuelled the changes, he said. More than 10 years ago countries witnessed a transition into a digital era, and now they are heading towards a period of cleaner energy and more environmentally friendly products, including EVs, he said. ""EVs may still be perceived as new alternative cars in the Thai market, but we want oil-powered car drivers to start thinking of EV capabilities and making themselves familiar with the technology,"" Mr Soranun told the Asean Sustainable Energy Forum, which was recently joined by EV startups. The age of EVs will eventually come as the Thai government is determined to promote the cars, while many power and car companies have embarked on EV businesses. The National EV Policy Committee earlier this year announced a goal to have EVs comprise 50% of vehicles made locally by 2030, part of an ambitious plan to make Thailand a regional EV production hub. Companies have also announced progress in developing battery production facilities and a range of EVs, from buses and boats to tuk-tuk three-wheel vehicles. SHARING WITH EVS Car-sharing services are expected to see a significant growth, providing an opportunity for EV business developers, said Krit Vichaiwatanapanich, co-founder and chief executive of Haupcar Co, the operator of a digital EV-sharing service platform. The service will satisfy many salarymen in cities as they do not want to shoulder the financial burdens of car purchases and deal with the struggle to find parking spaces, which are limited in many venues, including newly-built condominiums. Mr Krit expects EVs to be an eye-catching choice in the car-sharing market as the automotive industry will produce more EVs in line with global campaigns against climate change caused by global warming. His firm has developed an app to facilitate people who want to use cars. With a few clicks they can book their favourite car models and select areas to receive and return cars after use. Chayoot Sripian, founder and chief executive of Powerup Thailand Co, an electric tuk-tuk manufacturer, said his company decided to venture into a tuk-tuk-sharing service platform during lockdown. Powerup redesigned a tuk-tuk, making it bigger to better transport bed-ridden patients, elderly and disabled people, as well as vendors with large amounts of goods. Conventional tuk-tuks and taxis, with limited space, cannot do these jobs smoothly, he said. He sees good business prospects in this service because the number of elderly people increases every year. At present, there are up to 7,000 nursing homes for the elderly and the numbers rise by about 100 annually, he said. Such people need to visit hospitals regularly for scheduled medical check-ups. Supapong Kitiwattanasak, co-founder of Urban Mobility Tech Co (UMT), expects to see good business opportunities for electric tuk-tuks once Covid-19 subsides. UMT joined hands with Banpu Next, a unit of non-oil energy conglomerate Banpu Group, to provide a MuvMi e-tuk-tuk service, facilitating Bangkokians travelling between mass transit train stations and minor roads in areas where songthaew passenger trucks and taxi motorcycles are not enough. The two firms developed a ride-sharing system that lets passengers travelling in the same areas to be grouped together. CHARGING UP TRAVEL EV charging facilities are also expected to increase as firms are eager to add new charging outlets to better serve motorists. Poonpat Loharjun, founder and chief executive of Evolt Technology Co, said his company plans to increase the number of chargers to up to 300 units by 2023 to serve growing demand. As well, renewable energy and EV developer Energy Absolute Plc announced an ambitious plan to increase its EV charging outlets to 1,000 by the end of this year.",,bangkokpost
Community gifts pouring into hospital to support healthcare staff in Kamloops,https://infotel.ca/newsitem/community-gifts-pouring-into-hospital-to-support-healthcare-staff-in-kamloops/it86652,,,,"A heart-warming gesture by a Kamloops couple toward healthcare staff at Royal Inland Hospital appears to have triggered an avalanche of gifts and support from the community. The couple purchased an abundance of gift cards from local restaurants and had them distributed to the staff, to show their appreciation in response to the protests that took place in front of the hospital last month, according to a media release by the hospital. They said they want to pay it forward after they received quality care at the hospital over the past several decades. The couple purchased gift cards from Earls, Mason’s Kitchen + Bar, Mittz Kitchen, Peter’s Pasta and Romeos Kitchen and Spirits, which joined the cause by donating more gift cards of their own, according to the release. The couple initiated the act of kindness to show healthcare staff how meaningful their work is in keeping the community healthy, with the hope the staff uses the card to reconnect with family and recharge, while supporting local businesses. “We think everyone in our city benefits from our hospital, many individuals and businesses have inspired us with their acts of kindness toward healthcare professionals, and so we hope that this inspires others to show their expression of appreciation in any way they can,” said the couple in the release. The hospital foundation said it has received an outpouring of thoughtful gifts in support of healthcare professionals, including hundreds of gift cards from members and business owners of the Vietnamese Community. “We all agreed that we had to do something to show our gratitude to the healthcare workers at RIH after we saw what happened at the protests on September 1st. At one time or another, we all need their help, their dedication, their compassion, and their kindness, if not for ourselves, for our family members,"" said a member of the Vietnamese community in the release. ""So in their time of stress like right now, we wanted to make a kind gesture to uplift their spirits. What we did was just a very small gesture but we hope that other communities will join in to let healthcare workers know that they are not fighting this pandemic alone and they always have our support and gratitude."" So far, the RIH Foundation has received in-kind donations from the following generous local businesses: Chateau De Nails, Son Mai Spa, Bubble Tea Time & Waffles, Crystal Nails, Nina's Nails, Pho Viet & Donut King and Watercress Vietnamese Restaurant. Complimentary to this, a group of creative women from the Savona Seniors Ladies Craft Club decided show their appreciation for the healthcare staff at RIH by creating stunning handmade cards filled with words of encouragement for various departments in the hospital. “To everyone at Kamloops Royal Inland Hospital, thank you all for your dedication and professional care you have shown over and over again since Covid-19 came to our doors,"" said Yvonne Simmons, a member of the Savona Seniors Ladies Craft Club, in the release. ""You are truly heroes each and everyone."" Along with community groups, local businesses have also been offering their tokens of gratitude in support of healthcare professionals at RIH. The partners at KPMG also gave gift cards from numerous local businesses around the community. With the inundation of gifts received over the last few weeks, the RIH Foundation created a Staff Appreciation Program where all employees of RIH can register to win weekly prizes. With the help of the community, the foundation hopes to lift spirits and warm hearts one day at a time. The RIH Foundation would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to Chau and Huong, John and Tam, Trinh and Kim, Phuong, Huong, Thuy, Lan, and Vinh for their generous contributions.

Survey sees pay rise for employees in 2022,https://www.manilatimes.net/2021/10/25/news/national/survey-sees-pay-rise-for-employees-in-2022/1819652,['News'],['Kaithreen Cruz'],,"FILIPINO employees could expect a salary increase of around 5.6 percent in 2022, a survey by a global brokering company of 1,405 companies from 13 markets in the Asia Pacific found.Willis Towers Watson's 2021 Salary Budget Planning Survey provided data on salary budget increase percentages for the past and current years, along with projected increases for 2022.Those in the sectors of medical technology, business support service, including business process outsourcing (BPOs), and manufacturing industries posted the highest average salary budget increase — between 5.2 and 5.7 percent, according to the poll.By 2022, it is projected that medtech will remain as the top industry for a salary increase at 7.3 percent, followed by construction, property, and engineering at 6.2 percent, and business support services including BPOs and pharmaceuticals and health science at 6.1 percent each.Workers in the financial services, insurance, and energy and natural resources industries can expect the lowest pay increases for 2022, at 5.1, 4.8, and 4.7 percent respectively.""Although there is a positive outlook among businesses, companies are also monitoring the Philippine economic landscape, hence, organizations may further adjust their 2022 salary budget forecast in the [latter] part of this year,"" said Willis Towers Watson Philippines Rewards, Data, and Software Practice Leader Chantal Querubin.Almost all companies surveyed said they are expecting to proceed with their regular salary review in 2022.Businesses are going through extensive planning as they continue to experiment with hybrid models that better fit employees' lifestyles, which could result in long-term business savings, the poll said.The average salary increase within the Asia Pacific region is projected at around 5.3 percent for executives, management and professional employees, and support staff next year, from 4.9 percent.""Attracting and retaining employees remains a major challenge for employers. In fact, the current environment makes these challenges even more difficult. Employers need to deliver a sound employee value proposition supported by comprehensive total rewards programs. Beyond competitive salaries, which are table stakes at the moment, companies also need to focus their spend on a diverse set of benefits, wellbeing, and upskilling programs to drive employee engagement,"" Querubin said.Results also showed that around half of the companies (51 percent) surveyed located in the Philippines expect their business performance to be on target, with 43.8 percent expecting to be ahead of target this year.Job creation related to sales, information technology, and engineering could also be expected in the next 12 months, as 25.8 percent of companies are looking at hiring more workers. However, the majority of companies, at 65.3 percent, reported that they are looking at maintaining their headcount, as 8.9 percent of them said that they could reduce their workforce due to the negative impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on their businesses.""Companies are between a rock and a hard place when it comes to compensation planning. Employers need to continue effectively managing fixed costs as they rebound from the pandemic. On the other hand, companies recognize they need to boost compensation, especially in sectors where there may be a manpower crunch. This situation has driven organizations to explore alternative options to fixed pay increases, including sign-on, retention bonuses, functional and skill premiums, mid-year adjustments or pay increases,"" said Querubin.",,2021-10-24 16:11:00,,https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2021/10/24/22410.jpg,manilatimes

In Q2 , the company’s ad revenue hit $28.6 billion, comprising the majority of Facebook’s $29 billion in revenue. But with changes to ad targeting, most notably from Apple’s iOS update that allows users to opt out of ad tracking, Facebook has previously cautioned that “increased ad targeting headwinds” would impact revenue in Q3 and Q4. (Snap, reporting its earnings last week, said its earnings fell short of projections because of the iOS privacy changes and supply chain delays.) Looking ahead, the company released modest guidance for Q4, writing in its shareholder letting that the change was made “in light of continued headwinds from Apple’s iOS 14 changes, and macroeconomic and COVID-related factors.” The company also revealed plans to significantly change how it reports earnings going forward. Beginning in Q4, Facebook will report Facebook Reality Labs (FRL) as its own segment, separate from what the company will call “Family of Apps,” including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. FRL will include all virtual reality and augmented reality hardware, software, and content. The company says its investment in FRL will reduce its 2021 profits by $10 billion. For the social media giant’s user base, Facebook reported 1.9 billion daily active users and 2.9 billion monthly active users last quarter, and essentially the same numbers this quarter. Monday’s earnings follow the release of thousands of internal documents, known as the Facebook Papers, that detail how Facebook studied the harm caused or exacerbated by its platform and placed user engagement above the safety of users, among multiple other revelations, according to numerous reports from outlets that reviewed the leaked files .

Hospitals sustained huge financial losses from lost revenues during COVID-19 pandemic,https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-10-hospitals-sustained-huge-financial-losses.html,['Surgery'],,,"Postponement of nonessential surgical procedures early in the coronavirus pandemic not only disrupted surgical care at U.S. hospitals, but also took away a large portion of hospitals' total income, results from two studies reveal. These findings (from the two studies, which took place at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia) were presented at the virtual American College of Surgeons (ACS) Clinical Congress 2021.",,2021-10-24 07:41:24,"Postponement of nonessential surgical procedures early in the coronavirus pandemic not only disrupted surgical care at U.S. hospitals, but also took away a large portion of hospitals' total income, results from two studies reveal. These findings (from the two studies, which took place at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia) were presented at the virtual American College of Surgeons (ACS) Clinical Congress 2021. Surgical services are typically an important financial engine for hospitals, and the new study findings showed that curtailing surgical procedures for even two months can seriously impact a hospital 's financial security. Most elective, nonurgent operations in the country stopped from mid-March to early May 2020, to conserve resources for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Results of one study found that this two-month suspension cost a single university health care system 42 percent of its net revenue for five months. Nationwide, hospitals lost $1.53 billion from missed elective pediatric procedures alone, the other study investigators estimated as part of their study, for approximately the same period, March to May 2020. Hospitals were slow to make up the surgical backlog and the lost income from children's operations, with a median, or middle, time to recovery of one year, the investigators estimated. As COVID-19 cases reportedly continue to remain high in many states, some hospitals are again triaging cases and delaying selected operations. Consequently, the researchers said their findings demonstrate the need for better long-term planning by hospitals to prevent further shutdowns to ensure patients have access to the surgical services that they need. Reasons for not delaying surgical care ""Whenever possible, we should not delay surgical care for our patients,"" said the first study's lead investigator, Daniel M. Mazzaferro, MD, MBA, a plastic surgery resident at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. ""Surgery is a critical asset to the survivability of a health care system."" Moreover, delays in surgical care also can lead to patients' medical conditions worsening, affecting their quality of life, or sometimes even shortening it. Another result is patients may require more treatments, raising health care costs down the line, Dr. Mazzaferro noted. The pandemic resulted in an unprecedented temporary postponement of many elective operations across the country, as recommended by the American College of Surgeons (ACS) and other organizations in March 2020 to free hospital beds and other resources for COVID-19 patients. The ACS provided guidance for how hospitals could triage surgical cases—that is, select which operations to prioritize and which to defer until after COVID-19 caseloads decreased. 4 Financial impact Dr. Mazzaferro and his coworkers calculated the net revenues of three hospitals in their health care system during the first surge, or ""wave,"" of COVID-19 cases from March to July 2020, compared with the same period in 2019. A total of more than $99 million of net revenue was lost from all surgical departments and $58 million from the department of surgery in the first wave. The researchers reported a median net revenue loss of $636,952 per month per division for the department of surgery in the first wave, using updated data presented during the virtual Clinical Congress. However, the system lost significantly less money—$274,626 each month for each division—during a second COVID wave between October 1, 2020, and February 29, 2021. The surgical department did not suspend elective operations during the second surge, said Liza Wu, MD, FACS, senior investigator of this study and professor of surgery at the Perelman School of Medicine. ""We were in a better position than the first time around to continue with elective surgery,"" Dr. Wu said. ""We had more personal protective equipment or PPE, better COVID-19 therapies, and a better understanding of the virus, and we probably were able to get COVID patients out of the hospital faster."" Their surgical department, she added, also began triaging elective surgical patients using a new scoring system called the Medically Necessary, Time-sensitive Scoring, or MeNTS, which University of Chicago physicians described in the Journal of the American College of Surgeons. 5 After elective operations resumed in June 2020, surgeons quickly regained their productivity, Dr. Mazzaferro reported. He made this conclusion based on a measure of surgeon productivity that insurance payers use for reimbursement, called work relative value units (RVUs). Work RVUs decreased significantly less in the second COVID-19 wave than the first: 7.8 versus 13.2 percent. For the second study, researchers led by Sourav Bose, MD, MBA, MSc, then a postdoctoral research fellow at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, assessed the financial impact of COVID-related pediatric procedural cancellations. To project lost surgical revenues, they used the 2016 Kids' Inpatient Database, which represents approximately 80 percent of pediatric hospital admissions nationally. Dr. Bose, a general surgery resident at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, said the nation's children's hospitals delayed or canceled an estimated more than 51,000 elective procedures from March to May 2020. Lessons learned ""Our message isn't all about revenue. It's about how to efficiently manage surgical patients' needs,"" Dr. Bose said. ""Hospital systems must assess their operations management strategies to optimize the availability of surgical resources for patients with the greatest need."" He proposed that hospitals optimize any excess resource capacity that existed before the pandemic or increase their capacity for performing procedures based on their resources, such as expanding hours for operations. Dr. Mazzaferro also recommended that health care systems make long-term preparations so they can safely provide elective surgical care during future peaks in COVID-19 caseloads.

The logic he mentions used by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) in the UK, and also by their National Institute for Clinical Excellence, values a year of good quality life at £30,000. An extension of this idea is the “quality adjusted life year”, such that, say, a year which is estimated at being of only 50 per cent of peak quality is thus valued at £15,000. A medical treatment is justified by this logic if, for that cost or less, it can deliver such a quality of life. Ultimately, one might debate at length the quality of life a given individual already enjoys, and even more so what they might experience in the future. But at least such pragmatism creates some framework for these discussions. Meanwhile, the cost of hospital admission – about €1,000 per day generally and slightly over €2,500 in intensive care – can be weighed up against such predictions. The logic of the Sage group emanated from the opinions of scientific and medical experts. Noting that Mark Paul’s article featured in the business section of the newspaper, it’s worth considering that from a commercial angle two other radically different approaches can be taken to the determine the value of human life in such a context. In the early states of the Covid pandemic, much credit was paid to the South Korean state for its effective response to the pandemic. Part of the reason for their preparedness can be traced back to a Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers) outbreak there in 2015. It involved 186 cases and caused 38 deaths. The estimated impact on tourism alone was $2.6 billion, or about $14 million per case (Joo et al, Health Security 2019). The full impact on their economy was perhaps four times as high. Thus they were ready to act rapidly when Covid-19 appeared, fearing the costs of inaction. An entirely different approach, which incorporates the logic of insurance, is to look at the premium workers are paid to take on high-risk occupations and to correlate the excess payment with the actuarial risk they assume. For example a profession that carries a 1 per cent risk of death will attract extra payment. If that excess is multiplied by 100, then the market value of a life can, as offensive as it sounds, be quantified. This logic in the US gives a figure of about $10 million. In healthcare resourcing one must also at times factor in the opportunity cost, which is particularly relevant to ICU admission. Once such a bed is occupied by a patient, the space and its associated input are unavailable to others. This during Covid has lead to the odd consideration of how much resourcing can be focused on a disease for which there is arguably no effective treatment and thereby steered away from eminently treatable ones. While there is no easy answer to that, it does put the matter into stark relief. It also raises the question of vaccine refusal, and the freedom that entails. While encroaching upon that seems unthinkable, the freedom grants the refusenik the capacity to consume enormous quantities of tax revenue, while disrupting the treatment of others who did not choose to take any such risk. As discomfiting as these questions are, they cannot be entirely avoided. They trickle into areas from tourism to business and insurance, as much as healthcare, budgeting and hospital administration.

They also affect workers’ health, since pesticides need to be sprayed frequently. Based in Kuala Lumpur, Poladrone wants to change the way farms use pesticides with a combination of drones and automation and analytics software. The company announced today it has raised a $4.29 million seed round led by Wavemaker Partners, which it says is the largest seed round ever raised in Malaysia, based on data from Crunchbase. Other participants include the Malaysian Technology Development Corporation (MTDC), which is wholly-owned by Khazanah Nasional Berhad, the Malaysian government’s sovereign wealth fund; ZB Capital Limited; and angel investors. Founded in 2016 by Cheong Jin Xi, Poladrone now operates in Malaysia and Thailand and plans to expand into Indonesia, the world’s largest oil palm producer. Cheong told TechCrunch that Poladrone is profitable, but decided to seek funding after the COVID-19 pandemic hit and “highlighted the positive impact our technology has on agriculture communities by creating jobs and upskilling opportunities.” Indonesian agritech platform TaniHub Group harvests a $65.5M Series B round Adoption of Poladrone’s drones also increased during labor shortages caused by the pandemic, and the startup grew its team from 20 people to over 80 in less than a year to meet demand. Its seed round will be used for more hiring and to scale operations and build more Service Centers in agricultural areas, where clients can buy equipment and spare parts. Cheong first became interested in drones when he was a high school student in Melbourne, Australia, and it led to him pursuing an aerospace engineering degree at university. After Cheong returned to Malaysia, he began looking at potential applications for drone technology and realized “the agriculture industry made perfect sense,” because drones can fly over large terrains to perform repetitive tasks autonomously, and their cameras also capture a large amount of data. Cheong’s interest in agritech was also inspired by growing up in Kuala Lipis, an agricultural town in the state of Pahang. Many of his family members and relatives are involved in farming, and his early insights went into the development of Poladrone’s products. Rhinoceros beetles are a serious problem during the first three years of an oil palm’s 25 year lifecycle, he said, because attacks hurt trees’ growth, delaying them from reaching maturity and sometimes killing plants. “The issue is that once the surrounding oil palms matures, replanting is no longer possible which means that any space wasted on a dead palm would be wasted for the next 22 years,” Cheong said. As a result, oil palm farms usually need to perform preventative pesticide spraying every two weeks for the first two years after oil palms are planted, then every month until they mature. This is often done by workers with knapsack sprayers or on tractors. One of Poladrone’s Service Centers In 2020, the company launched Oryctes, developed with support from Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation, for precision spot spraying of rhinoceros beetles and other pests. It also recently launched Mist Drone, which blanket sprays open field crops, like paddies, corn and bananas. Most of the oil palm farms Poladrone works with are mid-to-large size, or about 5,000 hectares and above. “Data analytics and automation becomes extremely important for farms once they reach this scale,” Cheong said. He added that oil palm farms cover 18.7 million hectares around the world, and Poladrone sees a serviceable addressable market of 4.2 million hectares in Malaysia alone, worth over $1.3 billion per year. The company is also planning to expand its reach to other types of crops, like rice, corn and sugarcane. In addition to selling its products, Poladrone’s Service Centers also provide repairs, training and workshops, with the goal of increasing drone adoption. Cheong said it typically takes one week of training before workers start using Poladrone’s equipment, which can be operated from smartphones.

Over the coming months, the US will be withdrawing its remaining troops from Iraq, currently standing at around 2,500. The withdrawal may also turn ugly and that the old threats may resurface.

Thousands of Yazidis trapped in the Sinjar mountains as they tried to escape from Daesh in August ... [+] 2014. (Photo credit: Emrah Yorulmaz/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images) 2014 Anadolu Agency The world should not forget the atrocities perpetrated by Daesh fighters against religious minorities in Syria and Iraq in 2014 and in the years that followed. Those atrocities include murder, enslavement, deportation and forcible transfer of population, imprisonment, torture, abduction of women and children, exploitation, abuse, rape, sexual violence, sexual slavery and much more. The atrocities committed by Daesh are now recognized as crimes against humanity, war crimes and even genocide, the crime of crimes. The world cannot forget the particular wickedness of the atrocities. Video footage of beheadings, of kidnapped victims thrown from high buildings or burnt alive. These graphic images will be difficult to forget. Until this day, some 2,763 Yazidi women and children are still missing, whether in unknown location or dead. The UN has been warning about the ongoing threat posed by Daesh and its attempts to grow in power yet again, including by abusing the instability brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic. Despite the fact that Iraq declared victory over Daesh back in 2017, Daesh fighters have been present in the region in the years since. They continue to emerge periodically. Because of that, for example, in August 2021, Iraq launched a security operation to hunt down Daesh militants north of the capital Baghdad. Reportedly , Daesh militants “have an active presence in Tarmiyah district, 50 kilometers north of Baghdad, from where they launch attacks inside the Iraqi capital.” In early 2021, Alliance defense ministers have agreed to significantly raise the number of troops for the NATO Mission in Iraq, reportedly, from 500 to 4,000 . However, this is still far from the assessed number of Daesh fighters and their capability to recruit new members, as we have seen in 2013 and 2014. If the withdrawal from Iraq happens at the end of 2021, States must have a comprehensive action plan to prevent the disaster that we have witnessed in Afghanistan (mindful of the differences between the states but mindful of the risks involved). States must be ready to act to prevent the atrocities against religious minorities in Iraq, minorities which were subjected to genocidal atrocities only a few years ago. This is the time that States must act on the promise of Never Again and prevent avoidable atrocities against religious minorities.

Judge: No order barring union from discussing vaccine order,https://www.richmond-news.com/coronavirus-covid-19-national-news/judge-no-order-barring-union-from-discussing-vaccine-order-4550426,,['Canadian Press'],,CHICAGO (AP) — An order barring the president of the police union from making public statements encouraging members to disobey the city’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate expired after a judge on Monday denied a request to extend it.,,2021-10-26 01:27:16,"CHICAGO (AP) — An order barring the president of the police union from making public statements encouraging members to disobey the city’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate expired after a judge on Monday denied a request to extend it. Earlier this month, Cook County Judge Cecilia Horan granted the city’s request for a temporary restraining order. After hearing arguments Monday, she issued a written ruling denying the city of Chicago's renewal and expansion request saying the situation had “materially changed.” City attorneys wanted the order extended to include other union leaders in addition to Fraternal Order of Police President John Catanzara, accusing him of continuing to speak out or having other union officials do so in his place. “Mr. Catanzara continues to make statements that if not cross the line, come right up to over and certainly his toes are crossing the line,” Mike Warner, an attorney for the city, said. “These statements are adding gasoline to the fire. They are urging his members to engage in an unlawful act.” City employees have to be vaccinated by year's end with few exceptions or risk losing their jobs. Most departments complied with an initial deadline this month to report their status, but the police department has lagged behind in the escalating legal fight with the city. The city argued the union’s actions amounted to encouraging a work stoppage while union attorneys said the matter is part of a unfair labor dispute and the vaccine mandate was ordered without union input. Horan said that the situation since the first injunction had changed since the Oct. 15 deadline to submit vaccination had passed and “the threatened work stoppage has not come to pass.” Catanzara has directed members to defy the city’s requirement and been outspoken in recent days on social media and in person. He spoke Monday to dozens of of protesters gathered outside Chicago’s City Hall and during a City Council meeting. “This is not the way a government is supposed to run. It is not a queen on that throne. It is a mayor,” he said during the meeting, adding that there'd be “hundreds” of officers defying the order. He asked aldermen to back the union and support a proposal requiring council approval for policies that govern disciplining city employees, saying those who didn't would see challengers in the 2023 municipal election. Chicago police leaders, who call the vaccine mandate a matter of protecting officers and the public, have said less than two dozen officers haven't complied with the order to the point of risking their employment. The city's order allows for a temporary window of regular COVID-19 testing at the employee’s own expense until vaccines can be administered. Police Superintendent David Brown said Monday that 23 department employees were placed on “no-pay status” for failing to comply with the order. About 70% of department employees have reported their vaccination status, of which 80% are fully vaccinated, numbers that have recently increased. “We want to stay focused on protecting the people of Chicago. That includes the police officers of this department,” Brown said. “So we really see this as a life-saving effort for police officers ... Part of that means following through on the vaccine mandate.” ___ Associated Press reporter Kathleen Foody contributed to this report. Sophia Tareen, The Associated Press",,richmond-news

Milan broke the deadlock in the 16th minute with a spectacular style as Ibrahimovic's assist found Rafael Leao who sprinted down the left to drill home from a tight angle. It went from bad to worse for Bologna four minutes later as Adama Soumaoro saw red for dragging down Rade Krunic on the edge of the box. Milan made it 2-0 in the 35th minute as Samu Castillejo's attempt was blocked but Davide Calabria followed to release a missile. However, the home side got back level terms in just three minutes as Ibrahimovic accidentally scored an own goal in the 49th minute, before Musa Barrow finished with a first-time strike. But Bologna was dealt another blow as it was reduced to nine players when Roberto Soriano was sent off for stamping on Fode Ballo-Toure's ankle. Milan utilized the advantage and restored the lead in the 84th minute with Ismael Bennacer's blockbuster, before Ibrahimovic sealed the win in the dying minutes. Milan provisionally moved to the top with 25 points, one ahead of Napoli who visits Roma on Sunday. In Saturday's other fixtures, Empoli also beat Salernitana 4-2, while Sassuolo saw off Venezia 3-1.

Milan broke the deadlock in the 16th minute with a spectacular style as Ibrahimovic's assist found Rafael Leao who sprinted down the left to drill home from a tight angle. It went from bad to worse for Bologna four minutes later as Adama Soumaoro saw red for dragging down Rade Krunic on the edge of the box. Milan made it 2-0 in the 35th minute as Samu Castillejo's attempt was blocked but Davide Calabria followed to release a missile. However, the home side got back level terms in just three minutes as Ibrahimovic accidentally scored an own goal in the 49th minute, before Musa Barrow finished with a first-time strike. But Bologna was dealt another blow as it was reduced to nine players when Roberto Soriano was sent off for stamping on Fode Ballo-Toure's ankle. Milan utilized the advantage and restored the lead in the 84th minute with Ismael Bennacer's blockbuster, before Ibrahimovic sealed the win in the dying minutes. Milan provisionally moved to the top with 25 points, one ahead of Napoli who visits Roma on Sunday. In Saturday's other fixtures, Empoli also beat Salernitana 4-2, while Sassuolo saw off Venezia 3-1.

Demonstrators support Irving vs vaccine mandate at Nets game,https://lethbridgenewsnow.com/2021/10/24/demonstrators-support-irving-vs-vaccine-mandate-at-nets-game/,,,,NEW YORK (AP) - Demonstrators supporting Nets guard Kyrie Irving and protesting New York's vaccine mandate gathered outside Barclays Center on Sunday ...,"NEW YORK (AP) — Demonstrators supporting Nets guard Kyrie Irving and protesting New York’s vaccine mandate gathered outside Barclays Center on Sunday before Brooklyn’s home opener. A few dozen people were in the plaza outside the arena, some chanting “Let Kyrie play! Let Kyrie play!” and holding signs that said “Stand with Kyrie.” A small group even broke through barriers and got all the way to the front entrance of the arena about an hour before tipoff. Irving is not with the Nets because of his refusal to get vaccinated against COVID-19. A New York mandate requires professional athletes playing for a team in the city be vaccinated in order to play or practice in public venues. The Nets could have allowed Irving to play in road games, but they decided he wouldn’t be with the team until he could be a full participant. Irving explained during an Instagram Live post that he was doing “what’s best for me.” Protester Curtis Orwell said he and others were fighting for “bodily autonomy and sovereignty,” and the right to choose what goes in their bodies. “We also know so much more than we knew 18 months ago about the virus,” he said. “We have therapeutics that have been tried and proven to great success. Unfortunately, those kinds of voices are being totally suppressed and censored.” Orwell said he was not vaccinated and knew some people who had lost jobs because they weren’t. “It doesn’t feel right to them and that’s OK,” he said. “We need to respect that.” There were many empty seats in the arena as the game against the Charlotte Hornets was set to begin, though it was unclear if the commotion on the plaza caused it.

"Parents more hesitant to vaccinate kids than themselves, researcher says",https://halifax.citynews.ca/coronavirus-covid-19-national-news/parents-more-hesitant-to-vaccinate-kids-than-themselves-researcher-says-4547318,,['Canadian Press'],,Public health experts stress that some children do suffer from rare but serious impacts from COVID-19 as well as the little-understood impacts of the condition known as long COVID,,2021-10-25 14:35:21,"OTTAWA — Jennifer Hubert jumped at the opportunity to get her COVID-19 vaccine, but she’s not looking forward to having to make the decision about whether to vaccinate her three-year-old son Jackson. She recognizes the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, but said she also understands her son is at a much lower risk for serious illness than older adults. “To me it's not a clear benefit,” she said. While many parents were overjoyed at the news that Health Canada is considering approval of the first COVID-19 vaccine for kids age five to 11 in Canada, parents like Hubert are feeling more trepidatious, and public health officials said they are going to have a much more nuanced conversation with parents about vaccination than they did with adults. While 82 per cent of eligible Canadians aged 12 and up are already fully vaccinated, a recent survey by Angus Reid shows only 51 per cent of parents plan to immediately vaccinate their kids when a pediatric dose becomes available. Of parents with children in the five to 11 year age range, 23 per cent said they would never give their kids a COVID-19 vaccine, 18 per cent said they would wait, and nine per cent said they weren’t sure, according to the survey of 5,011 Canadians between Sept. 29 and Oct. 3, which cannot be assigned a margin of error because online surveys are not considered random samples. “Most of the research that I've seen sort of indicates that parents are more hesitant to vaccinate their kids against COVID than themselves,” said Kate Allan, a post-doctoral fellow at the Centre for Vaccine-Preventable Diseases at the University of Toronto. There are several reasons parents might pause, she said. It’s true that children are at a much lower risk of serious outcomes associated with COVID-19, and there have been very rare incidents of mRNA vaccines like Pfizer or Moderna linked to cases of myocarditis, a swelling of the heart muscle. As of Oct. 1, Health Canada has documented 859 cases associated with the vaccines, which mainly seem to affect people under 40 years old, and people who’ve developed the complication have typically been fine. “I know it's rare, I know it's not deadly, but I also see the risk of severe symptoms from COVID as being rare and not deadly for Jackson,” Hubert said when asked about weighing up the risks and benefits of the vaccine. But public health experts stress that some children do suffer from rare but serious impacts from COVID-19, which can also cause myocarditis as well as the little-understood impacts of the condition known as long COVID. They say parents should consider the less tangible benefits of vaccination as well. “It's less of a conversation about a direct benefit to them, and more of a community benefit,” Allan said. The pandemic has taken a heavy toll on children, depriving them of school, time with their peers, extracurriculars — and their mental health has suffered as a result, said Dr. Vinita Dubey, associate medical officer of health with Toronto Public Health. “Not one child has been spared from this pandemic. I mean every single child has had to bear a sacrifice because of the pandemic in one way or the other,” Dubey said. So far Pfizer-BioNtech is the only manufacturer to request approval for its pediatric COVID-19 vaccine and Health Canada is still reviewing the data. The regulator has promised the review will be thorough, and the vaccine will only be approved for children if the benefits outweigh the potential risks. Policy-makers know they’re going to have to take parents' concerns seriously as well. On a recent tour of the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario in Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with Dr. Anne Pham-Huy, a pediatric infectious diseases physician. “Vaccine confidence is going to be the most important part of it this time around,” Pham-Huy said, to which Trudeau agreed. Dubey has published research on improving parents’ vaccine confidence when it comes to long-established inoculations like mumps and rubella. While she offered several tips, they mainly come down to building trust. Her research focused on the role of family doctors, but she said during the pandemic anyone can be that trusted sounding board. “It could be a faith leader, it could be an important family member or friend, someone who you trust, to help guide you to the right sources to make that decision,” she said. With that in mind, several students from across North America launched a peer-to-peer education program called Students for Herd Immunity to allow kids to have those conversations among themselves. The public health experts agree, the debate around vaccines has become polarized and open conversations will be the key to addressing parents' concerns. “I think one thing to say to parents is you don't have to make your decision right away,” Dubey said. “I mean for those who are ready to make their decision, but it's fine but if you have questions, seek the answers.” Her only advice is to get those answers from a trusted source, and not social media.

Britons are eligible for their booster jab six months after the second. Currently only 4.5 million, out of the 9.3 million eligible, people in England have received the third dose. Patients are reporting issues with the NHS booking site as the process cannot be started until after the six months date, they must then wait an average of 18 days to get their appointment. One person on Twitter said their 90-year-old grandparents are trying and failing to book their booster jabs after being turned away from a pharmacy and having contradictory advice from 119. They claimed: ""My 90-year-old grandparents have been trying to get their booster jabs at but it’s impossible to book one!"" Medics and scientific advisers have accused the government of messing up the booster and school-age vaccine rollout. Because of their failings restrictions could be imposed. According to projections produced by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Covid hospital admissions and deaths over the next year could be halved if 90 per cent of over-50s who become eligible for the booster take it.",,express

Investors are counting on the prospects of slowing growth to keep the Federal Reserve from tightening monetary policy by too much down the road. Consumer-discretionary, energy, and materials shares helped buoy the market Monday, in what is slated to be a busy week of quarterly results from American corporations. This week’s earnings calendar features more than 150 S&P 500 companies, or nearly a third of the broad-market index, including Facebook Inc. FB, +1.26% , which reported after the closing bell Monday. “Earnings have been positive so far and there’s a chance we turn back to full rally mode now that we’ve made it through the most unfavorable part of fall,” said Phillip Toews, chief executive of Toews Asset Management. However, “one thing that could potentially set back stocks is if yields moved much higher.” So far, strong earnings are helping to keep the market’s bullish uptrend intact, even as concerns about inflation persist. The rise in stocks comes amid what investors regard as a “benign backdrop,” despite fears of a stagflationary-like environment building in the U.S., said Oliver Allen, a markets economist for London-based Capital Economics. “While doubts have grown surrounding the strength of the U.S. economic recovery, the very low level of inflation-adjusted yields suggests that investors do not expect the Fed to be especially aggressive when it comes to raising rates,” Allen said via phone Monday. Meanwhile, UBS Global Wealth Management is one of the firms remaining positive about equities. It points to encouraging signs from companies that’ve already reported third-quarter earnings. Some signs include strong revenue growth that is offsetting higher costs, and supply-chain disruptions which have been no worse than expected while remaining relatively concentrated in certain industries. “Continued solid profit growth is a core pillar of our outlook for further equity market gains,” Chief Investment Officer Mark Haefele wrote in a note Monday. “We advise investors to buy winners from global growth, including energy and financials.” Markets also will have an eye on Washington, D.C., as pivotal Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin appeared to back taxes on billionaires and certain corporations, according to the Associated Press, with the total price tag on a social services and climate change package estimated at $1.75 trillion. Manchin told reporters on Monday that he believes Democrats should be able to get a deal on a framework agreement this week, based on a report from The Hill . Read: What’s in — and not in — Democrats’ big social-spending bill, as billionaire tax gains steam Meanwhile, in public health news, Moderna Inc. MRNA said that children between the ages of 6 and 11 years old get a strong response against COVID-19, based on data from a Phase 2/3 clinical study evaluating children’s vaccine response. Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, said he expects children aged 5 to 11 to become eligible for vaccines by early-to-mid November. A review panel for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration found last week that the benefits of the shots outweigh risks, and an advisory committee will convene Tuesday to discuss the matter. If they vote in favor and the CDC grants final approval by next week, children could start getting their shots shortly after, Fauci told ABC News on Sunday.",,marketwatch

Videos that surfaced online showed protesters outside the arena ahead of the Nets’ first home game of the 2021-22 NBA season chanting “Let Kyrie play” while some held “Stand with Kyrie” signs. According to multiple reports, security had to lock down the building at one point, which prevented some fans from entering, but the game against the Charlotte Hornets began on time. The Nets did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment or confirmation that the arena was in a state of lockdown prior to the 4:00 p.m. ET (2000 GMT) tipoff. The NBA does not require players to be vaccinated but Irving is not eligible to play in home games because of coronavirus regulations in New York. The Nets announced ahead of the current season that Irving, a seven-times All-Star who joined Brooklyn in 2019 after stints with Cleveland and Boston, would not play or practice with the team until he is eligible to be a full participant. “Kyrie has made a personal choice, and we respect his individual right to choose,” the Nets said at the time. “Currently the choice restricts his ability to be a full-time member of the team, and we will not permit any member of our team to participate with part-time availability.” (Reporting by Frank Pingue in Toronto, editing by Pritha Sarkar)",,nationalpost

Kyrie Irving has been the talk of the NBA for several weeks now due to his unvaccinated status against COVID-19. He has stated on an Instagram live prior to the start of the 2021-22 NBA season that he isn’t anti-vax, rather, is anti-vaccine mandate. Irving feels people should be allowed to choose not to get the vaccine for personal reasons. Many believed that Kyrie Irving would cave as the season approached and would get the vaccine to play alongside his Brooklyn Nets teammates. A 1-2 record later for the Nets and there is absolutely nothing on the Kyrie Irving front in terms of when he could possibly return.

KD did his thing however, scoring 38 points on 71% shooting from the field. What has become the story for the night regarding the Nets unfortunately, is the fact that Nets fans chanted, “Let Kyrie Irving play!” and “Stand with Kyrie!” along with “No vaccine mandate!”. The scene eventually got out of hand and resulted in fans pushing against the barricades near Barclays Center in protest against the mandate. The scene outside Barclays Center where a group of protesters chant, “No vaccine mandate, Stand with Kyrie.” Several hold “Stand with Kyrie” signs. This is the Nets’ home opener.

Blak...,"NEW YORK (AP) — Andrew Mangiapane scored twice and the Calgary Flames beat the New York Rangers 5-1 on Monday night for their third straight win. Blake Coleman and Mikael Backlund each had a goal and an assist, and Christopher Tanev also scored for Calgary. Johnny Gaudreau got his seventh assist of the season and Jacob Markstrom stopped 28 shots. Dryden Hunt scored for the Rangers, who had won four straight — all on the road. Igor Shesterkin, making his fifth start, finished with 32 saves. Trailing 2-0 after 40 minutes, the Rangers got on the scoreboard early in the third period. Markstrom stopped the initial shot by Jacob Trouba, but Hunt corralled a rebound in front and put it past the goalie for his first of the season at 5:25. Coleman restored Calgary’s two-goal lead less than three minutes later as he backhanded the rebound of his own shot past Shesterkin for his second. Backlund made it 4-1 with 8 1/2 minutes left as he scored into the top left corner from the right circle for his first. Mangiapane got his second of the night, scoring on a rebound on the power play from the right side with just over five seconds remaining. It was his fifth of the season and 10th in his last nine games, dating to last season. Leading 1-0 after one period, the Flames doubled their lead early in the second. Mangiapane intercepted a pass by Patrik Nemeth from behind the Rangers net and beat Shesterkin from the right side at 2:09. Mika Zibanejad had a chance to get the Rangers on the scoreboard after a Flames turnover as he skated up the ice with Alexis Lafreniere, but was denied by Markstorm with about 6 1/2 minutes left in the middle period. Shesterkin made a nice glove stop on a slap shot by Tyler Pitlick about 40 seconds later. Markstrom stopped a wraparound try by Trouba with just more than two minutes to go, and then denied his backhand follow. Calgary outshot New York 15-7 in the first period. Shesterkin’s best save of the period came on an attempt by Sean Monahan in front with 3:15 remaining after a giveaway by the goalie. Tanev got the Flames on the scoreboard on a rush with 1:10 left in the opening period as he got a pass from Gaudreau and beat Shesterkin from the right circle on the glove side for his first of the season. Elias Lindholm got his first assist and seventh point on the play. The Rangers were down two players for much of the first. Rugged forward Ryan Reaves went to the dressing room early in the period after an apparent injury to his left leg, and defenseman Ryan Lindgren joined him by the midpoint after blocking a shot with his foot. Lindgren was back on the bench late in the period, and returned to the ice in the second. Reaves was also on the bench at the start of the second, but did not play again. SPECIAL TEAMS The Rangers went 0 for 2 on the power play and are 3 for 26 this season. … The Flames were 1 for 2 with the man advantage, improving to 3 for 14. LINEUPS Ryan Strome returned to the Rangers’ lineup after missing the four-game road trip due to COVID-19 protocols. He started on a line with Artemi Panarin and Barclay Goodrow. Morgan Barron was sent to Hartford of the AHL to make room for Strome. Injured forward Kappo Kakko is still out and coach Gerard Gallant said Kakko could return Friday. Julian Gauthier was also back in the lineup, and Greg McKegg was scratched. With the exception of Markstrom, the Flames used the same lineup as Saturday against Washington.

While it may conjure up images of swivelling heads and horror films for sceptics, the Catholic Church insists there is such a thing as being possessed by the devil and the only way to combat the phenomenon is through exorcisms. “We have seen an increase in the request for exorcisms because the pandemic has made people more vulnerable to the idea that Satan or some evil entity has taken over their lives,” Father Gian Matteo Roggio said. “People have fallen into poverty, they found themselves suffering from anxiety and depression.

KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 25 — The international tourism bubble for the Langkawi pioneer project will be opened to tourists from all countries, Tourism, Arts and Culture Minister Datuk Seri Nancy Shukri said.She added that the no-restriction policy was adopted as strict procedures would be in place to curb the spread of Covid-19 at the resort island.“The procedures include ensuring arriving tourists use tour agents registered with the ministry.“The agent will be the one who will arrange their entire journey and they will not come directly to Langkawi on their own. This is the mechanism we use, so if anything happens, like infection cases, the agent will be held responsible,” she said when answering questions from the media at an event at the Malaysia Tourism Centre (Matic) here today.She was queried whether the government would take similar steps as Singapore and Thailand in limiting tourist arrivals.She was met at the presentation of Financial Assistance and Contributions to 15 non-governmental organisations and 20 arts practitioners at Matic here today.The international tourism bubble, she said, was introduced to help the economy recover from the negative impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic, adding that the government could not afford to wait for too long to reopen the tourism sector to foreign tourists as it would cause locals to lose their jobs.“So we need to think rationally and consider the steps that can be taken for the benefit of all.“Also, the developments in Langkawi can become a model for us to examine tourist behaviour in helping curb the spread of Covid-19,” she said.She said since the recent announcement regarding the tourism travel bubble, many homestays in Langkawi have received bookings from tourists, especially from Europe.The international tourism travel bubble for Langkawi, is slated to begin on November 15, was announced by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob last Friday. — Bernama",2021-10-25 11:40:51,,,malaymail

It’s hard to imagine the ITV show without the inclusion of Ken, who’s been at the heart of the soap for decades. While the actor will turn 90 in April, there’s no sign of him slowing down from his role on the cobbles as it’s been reported bosses have offered him a new deal to stay on the soap. According to The Daily Star, execs are looking to sign him up for another year in a bumper deal worth six figures. A source told the publication: ‘Bill is a huge part of Coronation Street and they know how much the fans adore him. Ken waved goodbye to Norris Cole on the cobbles this year (Picture: ITV) ‘They love the idea of marking his 90th birthday with a great storyline. ‘Bill may be pushing 90 but he still has the energy, passion and talent that make him soap’s greatest-ever actor.’ Bill’s current contract reportedly ends later this year and there are plans for a major storyline to mark the occasion of the actor’s 90th birthday if he stays put. The actor has previously said he has no plans to exit the soap (Picture: Matt Crossick/PA Wire) Earlier this year, Bill took a short break from continuing drama in order to look after his health, when he contracted Covid. The soap said in a statement at the time: ‘Following recent reports about his health, William Roache has asked us to clarify that he took time off work after testing positive for Covid. ‘He has recovered well and is looking forward to returning to the cobbles as soon as possible.’ It comes after Bill addressed whether he’d ever think about leaving the soap in the near future.

The individuals caught novel coronavirus via close contact, Algoma Public Health reported late Sunday afternoon. Both are self-isolating. This brings the total number of confirmed cases to 503 since March 2020. Twenty-four cases are active as of early Sunday evening. There are currently no COVID-19 hospitalizations. There have been eight deaths in Algoma District, the most recent reported last Tuesday. Algoma Public Health reported Saturday an individual associated with the YMCA before and after school program, McNabb site, has tested positive for COVID-19. APH says if families from the program do not receive a low risk and/or high risk contact letter, their child is not considered a close contact of the person who tested positive for COVID-19, in which case APH does not recommend having their child tested unless they are showing symptoms of COVID-19. Algoma Public Health is working with that specific YMCA program and child-are centre to review and confirm “important practices” to reduce the potential spread of COVID-19. APH is conducting a “careful” investigation to identify close contacts. Examples of close contacts include household members, people who have been in direct physical contact or belong to the same classroom/cohort, and people who have spent more than 15 minutes together within two metres or six feet of each other, such as while sharing a meal. Brief interactions, such as walking past someone in a hallway are not generally considered close contact situations. APH will notify all low- and high-risk contacts via letter to provide further guidance and direction. Meanwhile, Ontario reported 492 new cases of COVID-19 on Friday, and 11 more deaths. Health Minister Christine Elliott said 325 of those cases are in people not fully vaccinated or their vaccination status is unknown. There are 149 people in intensive care units due to COVID-19, with 128 of them who are not fully vaccinated or have an unknown vaccination status. Meanwhile, Ontario reported 370 new cases of COVID-19 and one new related death Sunday ahead of lightened restrictions Monday, including the removal of capacity limits for restaurants, bars and gyms. There are 138 people hospitalized due to the virus and 137 in the ICU with COVID-related illnesses. Health Minister Christine Elliott noted in a Twitter post Sunday that not all hospitals report their numbers on weekends. Elliott said of the 370 new cases, 247 are in individuals who are not fully vaccinated or have unknown vaccination status, and 123 are in fully vaccinated individuals. Another 480 cases are now considered resolved. There have been 597,515 cases in Ontario since the pandemic began and 9,846 deaths. In the capital area, the Eastern Ontario health unit, which contains Cornwall, saw seven new cases while the Kingston area saw five. Renfrew County had one new case, and no new cases were reported in Leeds, Grenville, Lanark region. There is one new outbreak in a long-term care home, making for a total of six ongoing outbreaks in that type of facility. There are four active outbreaks in retirement homes and three in hospitals. The province has administered 22,385,190 total vaccine doses. Almost 87.9 per cent of the eligible population has at least one dose, while just over 83.8 per cent are fully vaccinated. — with files from Postmedia Network",,saultstar

Trudeau has long sought a trade deal with the 10-nation bloc, which includes the Philippines, Indonesia, Brunei, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Burma. He told a virtual business summit organized by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations that a free trade agreement with Canada would be a “win-win” for all sides, particularly coming out of the pandemic. Speaking in a pre-recorded message, Trudeau argued that an agreement with ASEAN would help companies and entrepreneurs build connections and business relationships around the world. He also said a pact would give investors more confidence to invest in international markets, and protect supply chains from the uncertainties brought by COVID-19. Trade bottlenecks across the globe have been slower to recover than consumer demand for goods, and slowed further by ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks and public health measures. All this affects inventories of in-demand consumer products or the delivery of parts needed to build things like cars, and pushes up transportation costs that get passed on to consumers, which is reflected in higher inflation rates. “As we finish the fight against COVID-19, deepening our ties with ASEAN economies and diversifying trade across the Asia-Pacific will play a crucial role in our recovery,” Trudeau said in his address. “My friends, a strong Canada-ASEAN relationship is a clear win-win for all of our businesses and all of our people.” The economies of the 10-nation bloc as a group represent Canada’s sixth largest trading partner, but the country already has access to four ASEAN members — Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam — through a Pacific Rim trade pact known as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). The Liberals’ election platform promised a new hub to help businesses take advantage of opportunities under CPTPP, and a new Asia-Pacific strategy aimed at deepening ties in the region, including new trade deals. A preliminary analysis by ASEAN and the federal government on the merits of a free trade deal estimated Canadian exports of goods and services to the bloc could go up by 13.3 per cent, valued at US$2.67 billion In his address, Trudeau said both sides must also ensure women, Indigenous people, LGBTQ entrepreneurs, visible minorities and other under-represented business owners get involved in and benefit from trade.

Mary May Simon received the symbolic first poppy Monday as the Royal Canadian Legion launched this year’s annual national fundraising campaign for veterans ahead of Remembrance Day. May Simon accepted the poppy from Legion dominion president Bruce Julian during a ceremony at Rideau Hall in which attendees noted that this year also marks the 100th anniversary of the poppy having been adopted as a symbol of remembrance. Anna Guerin of France is credited with having first proposed the poppy as a symbol of the horrible costs and sacrifices of war in the aftermath of the First World War. Guerin drew inspiration from In Flanders Fields, the moving poem written during the war by lieutenant-colonel John McCrae and which continues to be read at Remembrance Day ceremonies across Canada and other parts of the world each year. The Great War Veterans’ Association of Canada officially adopted the poppy symbol in 1921, and the iconic flower has been worn in the weeks leading up to the annual ceremony ever since. Donations collected during the fundraising campaign are used to support various Legion programs for veterans, including emergency food and shelter as well as bursaries, disaster relief and remembrance activities. This year marks the second Remembrance Day since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Legion has indicated it expects another year of smaller-than-usual crowds on Nov. 11. Legion grand president Larry Murray nonetheless underscored the importance of Canadians paying respects to the sacrifices of those who fought and died defending the country and its values and principles. “In the second pandemic year, remembrance reminds us that our nation has been through even more challenging times,” he said. “Canadians persevered then, and we will now.

Delay in BPCL sale likely as suitors find no partners,https://www.thehansindia.com/business/delay-in-bpcl-sale-likely-as-suitors-find-no-partners-712467,"['Business,Today NewsPaper']",['The Hans India'],,"The 3 suitors-Vedanta Group, Apollo Global Management and I Squared Capital-talking to global energy giants and sovereign and pension funds, but haven’t been able to finalize partners","Delay in BPCL sale likely as suitors find no partnersDelay in BPCL sale likely as suitors find no partnersIndia's plan to privatize Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) has run into rough weather with bidders struggling to find partners and spread their financial risks, according to people familiar with the matter.The three suitors - the Vedanta group, Apollo Global Management and I Squared Capital - are talking to global energy giants and sovereign and pension funds, but haven't been able to finalize partners, the people said, asking not to be identified as the deliberations are private. Some bidders are finding it difficult to invest due to sustainability rules that make it tougher for them to buy a stake in an oil refiner, some of the people said. The fresh hurdle to sell the government's entire stake could temper some of the euphoria generated by the recent sale of Air India Ltd to the Tata Group and slow down the nation's biggest privatization drive. The sale of the state-run refiner-cum-fuel retailer would have fetched about $13 billion for the exchequer and other shareholders. BPCL shares fell 3.5 per cent to Rs 431.7 at the close in Mumbai, the most in more than a month, following the Bloomberg News report. The massive price tag means bidders as well as the Indian government want a consortium with stronger technical and financial muscle for the transaction, the people said. Spokesmen at the finance ministry and BPCL weren't immediately available for a comment, while Apollo Global declined to comment. Representatives at Vedanta and I Squared didn't reply to emails seeking comment. India Still Hopes Oil Majors Will Join Race for Biggest Sale.A global push toward green energy and pressure from investors to slash emissions is holding back companies from making large investments in fossil fuels. The pandemic and its fallout has also delayed the process and discouraged global firms from committing big investments in traditional fuels. For BPCL, the bidders have been slow in conducting due diligence as they wait for new partners to join, the people said. That will likely upend the federal government's aim to complete selling its entire 53 per cent holding in BPCL by the end of this financial year in March, for which it had planned to seek financial bids next month. BPCL allowed bidders virtual access to its financial data early April, but it hasn't progressed beyond exchange of a few queries and some initial discussions with the state-run company's management in the past six months. ""Bidders are conducting due diligence, but uncertainty over the bidder consortium and process complexity, including valuation, may lead to potential delays,"" Fitch Ratings Ltd. said in a commentary last month. ""We believe the risks of further Covid-19 waves and global oil and gas companies' increased focus on energy transition lead to additional uncertainty over the timing and valuation of potentially large acquisitions in the sector."" BPCL has three refineries that can process about 700,000 barrels of oil daily, a marketing network of almost 19,000 fuel stations and close to 6,200 liquefied petroleum gas distributors.

"B.C. restaurants, food sector struggling with staffing as COVID-19 measures ease",https://vancouver.citynews.ca/2021/10/25/bc-restaurants-staffing-capacity/,,['Hana Mae Nassar'],,"While capacity limits have been lifted in parts of B.C. for a number of businesses, you may still find yourself waiting while out for a bite or drink.","While capacity limits have been lifted in parts of B.C. for a number of businesses and gatherings, you may still find yourself waiting while out for a bite or drink. According to the Alliance of Beverage Licensees, the industry is still facing a number of challenges, though the scaling back of COVID-19 measures is welcome news. “We estimate we’re about 40,000 workers short right now. So, if you’re out there and you’re wondering why it takes longer to get service at your favourite restaurant, bar, or pub, we’re struggling with that as well. We’re doing the best we can with inadequate staffing,” explained Jeff Guignard, ABLE BC executive director. The staffing shortage, he says, is expected to be a longer term challenge, with a few factors adding to struggles. “The hospitality industry has relied upon foreign workers in a lot of places,” he explained, pointing to travel measures brought on by the pandemic, through which many countries moved to shut down borders to non-essential travel to limit the spread of the virus. Related articles: B.C.’s capacity limits lifted on restaurants, arenas, concerts, and more B.C. event planners, tourism industry looking forward to lifted capacity limits B.C. doctors group opposes lifting COVID-19-related capacity limits on events Second, Guignard notes the sector was “essentially shut down” for about a year, meaning many people lost their jobs. Many of them went on to find new employment. Finally, he says there are the select few who have been taking advantage of federal and provincial aid programs, despite many businesses paying more. “Yes, sometimes that comes with costs for us as well, and we’re in a low-margin business that’s been losing money for a while, so we do have to pass off some of those costs to customers, of course, and we’re hoping everyone will be understanding about that.” The food services and hospitality sectors have been hard hit through the pandemic, with many businesses operating at an overall loss over the past year. Guignard says everyone is anxious to get back to normal. “We wish these steps were going faster,” he admitted on Monday. “But at the end of the day, today is really good news for our industry.” As of Monday, there are no longer capacity restrictions for venues that require proof of vaccination in many parts of the province, meaning businesses are able to fill their establishments to 100 per cent capacity if they are checking for B.C. Vaccine Cards. As part of the scaling back of COVID-19 measures, patrons are able to now mingle between tables, no longer being forced to stay in their seats while out. Venues are allowed to determine their own table limits, and there are no longer any restrictions on liquor sale hours. Measures still remain However, some measures remain. People are still required to wear masks in indoor public spaces, dancing is still not permitted, and full vaccination is required to access certain non-essential businesses, services, and events. Pandemic rules are also not being relaxed across the province. Regional restrictions remain for the Interior Health, Northern Health, and Fraser East regions due to high COVID-19 case numbers and low vaccination rates. “We’ve been losing money, we’ve barely broken even for the past 18 to 20 months,” said Guignard of struggles the industry has faced. “All of these restrictions have, accidentally, been really borne by the hospitality industry, people on the frontlines, right? We haven’t been able to host events properly, we haven’t been able to be at full capacity, we’ve had to check vaccine passports and so many of those things, which has been difficult.” He believes the lifting of restrictions is a step in the right direction. However, he says there are still some challenges workers and businesses will have to navigate, pointing to the dancing restrictions and their impacts on places like nightclubs. “It’s been very difficult to help customers understand, especially now that everyone’s double vaccinated … why you can’t dance,” Guignard explained. “We’ve got back to standing and mingling, that’s a good step, and I think we’ll get back to dancing fairly soon. Even just the simple fact of allowing people to stand up is taking tremendous pressure off staff who have had to go around the room over, and over, and over again to remind people they’re not allowed to stand.” -With files from Claire Fenton",2021-10-25 17:56:15,,https://vancouver.citynews.ca/wp-content/blogs.dir/sites/9/2021/05/21/Restauraunts-indoors-Vancouver-1024x580.png,citynews1130

"AY.4.2 up to 15 per cent more transmissible than Delta, may be named ‘Nu’",https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/health/ay-4-2-up-to-15-per-cent-more-transmissible-than-delta-may-be-named-nu-329006,,,,"London, October 24 A sub-variant of the Covid Delta strain—AY.4.2 -- may be up to 15 per cent more transmissible than the original Delta, scientists estimate. AY.4.2 made up almost 10 per cent of all infections in England in the fortnight ending October 9, the Daily Mail reported. Its prevalence in England doubled in a month from being behind four per cent of cases in September to 8.9 per cent in the two weeks to October 9, said scientists at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. AY.4.2, which is one of 45 sub-lineages of Delta and dubbed by many as Delta plus, is likely to be named as Nu, the report said. The strain could be the most infectious subvariant seen since the pandemic began, Professor Francois Balloux, director of the University College London Genetics Institute, was quoted as saying to the Financial Times. The World Health Organisation will likely elevate AY.4.2 to a ""variant under investigation"", which means it would be given a name under its Greek letter naming system, Balloux added. However, he noted that since the UK is the only country where the sub-lineage has ""taken off"", its quick growth could also be a ""chance demographic event"". ""The emergence of yet another more transmissible strain would be suboptimal. Though, this is not a situation comparable to the emergence of Alpha and Delta that were far more transmissible -- 50 per cent or more—than any strain in circulation at the time,"" Balloux said. ""Here we are dealing with a potential small increase in transmissibility that would not have a comparable impact on the pandemic."" The UK has recorded about 50,000 new Covid infections, marking another three-month high. Hospitalisations and deaths are also on the rise. According to the latest weekly report from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA)—which has replaced Public Health England—revealed Covid cases have risen in all age groups, but are now at a record high among school children. AY.4.2 has spread to all but two dozen places in the country. Some experts have said the subvariant may be behind the surge in cases in the UK, which other European countries are not seeing to the same extent. However, there is yet no evidence that AY.4.2 is more deadly than earlier versions of the Delta strain, which was first identified in India last December, the Daily Mail report said. It includes two mutations—called Y145H and A222V—and is being monitored, the UKHSA said. Both of these spike mutations have been found in other virus lineages since the pandemic began—but are not present on any current variant of concern. — IANS",,2021-10-24 11:40:06,,https://englishtribuneimages.blob.core.windows.net/gallary-content/2021/10/2021_10$largeimg_1281351769.jpeg,tribuneindia
"Moderna COVID booster: What to know about mix and match, who can get it and when - CNET",https://www.cnet.com/health/moderna-covid-booster-what-to-know-about-mix-and-match-who-can-get-it-and-when/#ftag=CADf328eec,,['Clifford Colby'],,You might be eligible to get the Moderna booster shot now. Here's what we know.,,2021-10-24 21:38:09,"Moderna boosters are here. Algi Febri Sugita/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images For the most up-to-date news and information about the coronavirus pandemic, visit the WHO and CDC websites. The Moderna booster shot against COVID-19 got the green light last week after lengthy debate that culminated in the FDA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention authorizing the drug for a third dose. But that doesn't mean it'll be available to everyone -- at least not yet. We'll walk you through who's eligible to receive the Moderna booster shot, when, and what the deal is with mixing and matching vaccine brands . Authorization for the Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson booster shots comes at a time when the deadly and highly contagious delta variant surged in the US, causing hospitals in some states to once again buckle. With cases, hospitalizations and deaths beginning to plateau, epidemiologists worry about another wave of COVID infections as cold weather drives people indoors in closer quarters, and as the annual flu season begins to kick in, eroding immune systems. The FDA-approved COVID vaccines have proven to be highly effective in preventing hospitalization, and those who are unvaccinated are 10 times more likely to be hospitalized . With the new federal vaccine mandates , the Biden administration aims to counter the surge and put pressure on anyone who hasn't been vaccinated. Keep reading for more details on Moderna's COVID-19 booster shot. For more on COVID-19, here's the latest on COVID-19 vaccines for kids , what to do if you lost your vaccination card , the difference between a booster and a third dose and breakthrough infections . Now playing: Watch this: COVID-19 boosters and the delta variant: What you need... 7:23 Who can get a Moderna COVID-19 booster shot now? The FDA authorized a Moderna vaccine booster for Moderna recipients age 65 years of age and older and adults who are at high risk because of severe illness or exposure in their work setting. Additionally, all Johnson & Johnson recipients age 18 and older will also be able to get a Moderna booster after two months of getting vaccinated, and will be eligible for Pfizer's booster . Those who are eligible can get their shots now. The CDC recommends the following get their booster shot six months after they've been fully vaccinated with either Pfizer or Moderna. People who are: 65 years and older 18 or older who live in long-term care settings 18 or older who have underlying medical conditions 18 or older who work or live in high-risk settings Yes, you can now mix and match vaccines The FDA has authorized mixing COVID boosters , which in the US includes Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson. Anyone eligible for a booster can get any of the available brands of coronavirus vaccines. If you received Johnson and Johnson, you'll be able to get the Moderna or Pfizer booster if it's been two months or longer since you received the initial dose. If you received Moderna or Pfizer for your first two shots, you could get any vaccine -- including J&J -- if it's been six months or longer since your second shot. CNET Health and Wellness Our Health & Wellness newsletter puts the best products, updates and advice in your inbox. What does the Moderna booster shot do? A COVID-19 booster shot -- whether from Moderna, Pfizer or Johnson & Johnson -- would top off your immune response and guard against a breakthrough COVID infection as the vaccine's effectiveness decreases. Recent studies of the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines show that their effectiveness can begin to wane after six months. Moderna said early data suggests that those who received the Moderna vaccine in 2020 are showing a higher rate of breakthrough COVID infections than those vaccinated this year, suggesting the need for a booster to maintain high levels of protection. Is the Moderna booster shot the same as the original COVID-19 doses? Yes, almost. As with Pfizer's booster, the third Moderna shot will be the same vaccine as the first two doses, except it'll be a half dose. To make your life simpler, Moderna is also working on a combination shot that includes this year's flu vaccine and its COVID-19 booster vaccine, but that is not available right now. Where can I get the Moderna booster shot? According to the White House , boosters will be available at roughly 80,000 places across the country, including over 40,000 local pharmacies. Some 90% of Americans have a vaccine site within 5 miles of where they live. You can check Vaccines.gov to see which vaccines are available where, or call 1-800-232-0233 for vaccine information. Is the Moderna COVID-19 booster shot free or do I have to pay? All booster shots will be free regardless of immigration or health insurance status. However, depending on where you get your booster shot -- for example at a local pharmacy -- you may be asked to log your insurance status. For example, you may be asked to provide your insurance card information, including your name, date of birth and membership number. You will not be charged for your COVID vaccine or booster shot. For more on coronavirus treatments and vaccines, here's what we know about monoclonal antibody treatments , the new federal vaccine mandates and why some people may not want the shot . Will I need a fourth COVID booster shot? While this question has been raised, there's no current plan to decide on a fourth Moderna booster shot at this time.

Ontario Wants To Create A Better Work-Life Balance For Employees & Here’s How,https://www.narcity.com/toronto/ontario-wants-to-create-a-better-work-life-balance-for-employees--heres-how,,['Canada Edition (EN)'],,"If you're struggling to find the perfect work-life balance at your job, the Ontario government's new proposed legislation might help you out. Ontario announced new legislation to ""promote healthy work-life balance"" called the Working for Workers Act, 2021 in a news release on Monday. If the legislation is passed, it ""will further enable competitiveness by banning unfair non-compete agreements that are used to restrict work opportunities, suppress salary increases and wage growth,"" according to the Ontario government. ""COVID-19 has changed the way we work, leaving too many people behind, struggling to put food on the table and make ends meet for their families,"" said Monte McNaughton, minister of labour, training and skills development.On top of this, employers with 25 or more workers would be required to ""develop disconnecting from work policies,"" which the Ontario government describes as ""expectations about response time for emails and encouraging employees to turn on out-of-office notifications when they aren't working.""The legislation also includes measures brought up earlier this month like allowing delivery workers to use restaurant bathrooms, helping people trained in ""regulated professions"" outside of Canada continue their careers in Canada and new licencing rules for recruiters and temporary help agencies.",,2021-10-25 14:58:46,,https://www.narcity.com/media-library/ontario-wants-to-create-a-better-work-life-balance-for-employees-heres-how.jpg?id=27762516&width=980,narcity
Rise & Grind: Kalan.FrFr Talks Signing With Jay-Z's Roc Nation & Marveling At His Height,https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/rise-and-grind-kalanfrfr-talks-signing-with-jay-zs-roc-nation-and-marveling-at-his-height-news.141567.html,,['Aron A.'],,"Kalan.FrFr details his love for Kanye West, signing to Jay-Z, and the state of Los Angeles' hip-hop scene on Rise & Grind. https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/rise-and-grind-kalanfrfr-talks-signing-with-jay-zs-roc-nation-and-marveling-at-his-height-news.141567.html","Rise & Grind is a brand new editorial series, meant to introduce and dissect new, buzzing, or underground artists.Los Angeles has a hub of inspiration for music relating to the struggle, but there’s always been a balance highlighting the beauty of California. Women, weed, and weather, as Dr. Dre said on Kendrick Lamar’s “The Recipe.” Kalan.FrFr is highlighting all those aspects. The melodies he brings speak to love and heartbreak while the guttural side of his artistry can easily soundtrack a good time.The rapper is riding high off of the release of Two.Fr 2-- the official follow-up to his 2018 predecessor. It was a concerted choice that came after joking with the idea of using Hoochie Hotline as the title of his next project. While some of the songs did end up making it on to Two.Fr2, the Roc Nation-signed artist explained that it felt like the right time to double back to the project that established his name.Image provided by the artist“I’m more mature now. I'm more mature as an artist,” he says. “It was just time. I had to go with what I knew. I can’t explain the feeling, but I had the feeling again. It felt like TwoFr, so it was time to go in.”With songs like “Never Lose You” having a grip on summer 2021, the future is looking quite promising for Kalan.FrFr. The rapper is hitting the road this fall for the Two Fr tour alongside Haiti Babi, Kyle Banks, and Jehkai. We chopped it up with Kalan.FrFr for the latest installment in Rise & Grind about his latest project, his love for Kanye West, and more.Stay tuned for a new installment of Rise & Grind every Monday.Image provided by the artistStomping Grounds:I'm from Carson, California and Compton. I grew up in both. My mom stayed in Carson, and my dad stayed in Compton, so I was always hella back and forth. But now I'm from all over. I represent all of LA, from the East Side to the West. I lived in all these places, and I got so much family. I’m a real LA native, all the way around. 100%.It's not really all that different [growing up between Compton and Carson] because pretty much everybody in all of these communities know each other. My cousins would be over there, I would go down, and they’d come over here, come hang out with me. Then, by the time we all started playing sports and going to junior high school and high school, everybody knew each other. Zodiac Sign:I'm an Aries. I've been told that I’m every bit an Aries. Everything that they got to say about it, I’m a lot of. I ain’t a liar, though. I’m one of the cooler Aries. I be hearing a lot of Aries are liars. I don’t be lying. There ain’t no need to lie. I got past that, whatever that stage was. I’m loud as hell. You can't stop me from being loud. I’mma always feel offended. I always think somebody's trying to offend me, 100%. I’m hella sensitive, but I’ll never show it. I got way too much pride. I got pride out the window. I’m pretty much all of that, if I had to describe myself real quick. Top 5 DOA:It’s not in no order, but Biggie, Jay-Z, Lil Wayne, and… I'm not gonna lie and it's early to be saying bro, but Brent Faiyaz is one of my favorite artists right now. I feel like people would have listened to him in the 80s and 90s. No matter where you threw him, I feel like his music would’ve worked. Good music don’t fade, so I'll give him that. And then I'm putting myself in there. I don’t be giving myself enough credit. I really like my own music, so I'm gonna throw myself in there.[If I couldn’t include myself, it would be] my favorite, Stevie Wonder— or Michael Jackson, of course. I don't really count Michael Jackson because to me, that's the greatest of all time. He don't even get compared to nobody. So Michael Jackson out the gate, but I put Stevie Wonder in there. He’s another one of them dudes. I ain’t even gonna use Stevie Wonder because I look at Stevie Wonder too high. Top five dead or alive, at the end, for five is Kanye, like Late Registration Kanye. That was my favorite Ye.As I got older, I just started to realize that Biggie makes great songs. From the samples to what he’s talking about, to how he’s flowing. He’s a picture painter. That sh*t is dope. I admire that. Jay— it’s Jay, bro. [Laughs] C’mon, man. Wayne’s hard. Wayne does so much. I feel like you could put Wayne on any type of beat, and he would never get boxed in. He can make a song that'll be a hit for him. All the mixtape shit he did was amazing. Brent— like I was saying, just throw him anywhere. It’s gonna work. Ye was my favorite. It kind of took a turn for me when the music started changing, like ""808s & Heartbreaks"" and sh*t like that, but I always respected it. It was always a different type of music. I love it because it's Ye, but I'm a product of my environment. I need to hear what I'm going through. That was what I was looking for: sh*t that I can relate to. So, it took a turn for me. I stopped listening to him as much. I always give him a listen. You couldn't stop me from listening to Kanye West. I used to try to dress like Kanye West. Kanye is the best ever, n****— producer and rapper. All them albums was just him being himself and pouring his emotions into the music, but it’s still uplifting. It's hard for people to do that. I strive to do that. I strive to still make you smile, no matter what I'm saying. I strive to make you feel emotions. I want this song to make you feel good. I want this song to make you feel sad. I want this song to make you think. Even if he wasn't doing it on purpose, that’s what I got from his music. That's the impact it had on me. Ye is one of the greatest to ever do it, all-time. Biggest Accomplishment:It’s probably gonna sound crazy, but just being able to make money. I’ve been doing music for so long for nothing— not for nothing, but just to be able to do this. Being able to make money is beautiful. So many people -- it’s these people's passion. They put so much into it — so much time, so much effort, so much money — and they don't receive anything out of this. I feel hella blessed that this is all I have to do: to make music. Right now, I’m fortunate enough to take care of myself. I take care of other people. That’s the blessing within it all. This is my job at the end of the day. My job is to be myself as much as I can. I can't trade that for the world. Ain’t nobody get to go to work as happy as me. I promise you. This sh*t is happy. Even when I'm mad, I'm happy, because I'm mad about asking for more. That's usually what I'm mad about. I'm already doing well. I'm cool. Aye man, it was this or UPS. [Laughs]Studio Habits & Essentials:I'm gonna say, “Do y'all f*ck with that?” like 1000 times. That's weird. It gets to the point where homies be like, “Bro, don't ask us nothing. Just keep recording. Don't say nothing. Yes, we f*ck with it. Everybody in here nodding their head. You don't got to ask us, ‘Do we f*ck with it?’”  And then sometimes, I'll make the engineer put the headphones on so can’t nobody hear it. They get mad when I do that. And 3 things I need in the studio… weed. That’s the first one. Definitely don't want to be in the studio and not be high. I don't got to get high to make music, but I would rather be high. That's cool for me. I get a lot done. If it's a late session, I need my blanket so I can curl up and listen to the music after it's done. And snacks. The snacks gotta be superior. If we send you to go get snacks, and you come back and strike out, we probably won't even smoke with you. That snack sh*t is serious. You gotta have the right snacks. The last time we went to ‘yo, we didn’t even have the right snacks. My cousin ordered some Wingstop and got naked chicken. I ain’t never seen no chicken with no seasoning— just plain chicken! That n**** crazy.[The worst snack run] I think we was in the studio in Atlanta, and n**** brought back some sunflower seeds or something like that. I'm like, “Bro, what the f*ck?” [Laughs] Some almonds or something. That’s wasn’t it, bro. You didn't get the right sh*t.TwoFr 2:From what everybody say, it’s going good. And there's always room for improvement. Honestly, I love it. I love the response I'm getting. I'm getting booked for shows, people really listening to the music, my streams going up every week. I’m extremely appreciative, and I'm appreciative that so many people rock with the music, but I'm just excited to do it again. I have so much more music. I'm working so hard. I work so much. I just want to show everybody what I got, and hopefully, just get bigger and bigger every time. With the “Hoochie Hotline”, it was gonna be a quick EP, and it was gonna be more songs catered towards women. We swapped a lot of the songs out. We added a bunch of songs. It was really a feeling. It was more, “Man, it’s time for TwoFr 2.” I was having that feeling that I had when I dropped ""TwoFr,"" and that was the tape that took off, that started my music stuff, with “Right Wit It”, and “Finance”, and “Naked”. That’s what started up my name, started making me a household name, actually putting some rank on it. So just doubling back around— this time, bigger platform, bigger music, everything's growing. I’m more mature now. I'm more mature as an artist. I've learned so much more out of being in so many situations, met people. It was just time. I had to go with what I knew. I can’t explain the feeling, but I had the feeling again. It felt like ""TwoFr,"" so it was time to go in.With Blue Bucks, them the homies. We have been recording. We have been supposed to get in the studio, been recording. Even if we don't record, we still pull up on each other. I was just like, “Bro, I got one. I’m finna put this sh*t on my tape.” Them n***** pulled up on me and knocked it out. With the song with Durk, that wasn't the original song I wanted to put Durk on. I’m blessed because I have so many other good people around me, so many people that are interested in music and have a music background. They were like, “Nah, maybe you should put him on ‘I Like.’” That was all them. That didn’t even have nothing to do with me. So we sent bro the song, bro got on there, worked it in. But me and Durk have already had music together. I f*ck with them OTF n***** heavy. We got locked in. It was cool. I be running into Durk everyday at the studio, so it ain’t nothing to get stuff done with them. Bro was f*cking with the record, too. It was dope.First Bars:It probably was something stupid, something weak. I remember I used to try to rap when I was really little, and it was horrible. [Laughs] It just wasn’t it. But it was probably something about 24-inch rims. My cousin had 24-inch rims on his Denali. So it probably was that. He used to take me to school in the morning sometimes. I used to feel cool as hell getting out.  He had the XL Denali, the big, long ass one, so it was probably something about that. But it was sorry, whatever it was. [Laughs]My first time ever recording was in the garage. My cousin and his homies made music for fun. He played in the league, but he used to make music. My cousin Kenan. He'd be making music with his friends. I had to be like 10, and I was like, “Let me make a song.” He was like, “Alright, you gotta do everything yourself,” so he made me make the beat, made me make the song. I did everything. I made the beat on Reason, and I recorded the song on Pro Tools. I did it with an MPC. Sh*t, that’s when I fell in love.He was walking me through [ProTools and Reason] but he made me do it myself. He was like, “I'm not finna do it for you. Drag that there.” I had rhythm and sh*t like that. I had a feel for what I was doing. I knew what I wanted to do. That's when I was into Kanye West like heavy. I was up on what was going on. I was probably in sixth grade when that sh*t happened. My garage was my studio until ""TwoFr."" I did ""TwoFr"" in my garage. I did half of it in Atlanta, and I did the other half right here in my garage. I remember doing a song with Slimmy B. All my homies was in the garage. That was my first time doing a feature with somebody that was bigger than me. Somebody I didn’t know. I had done sh*t with Jay and all of that, 1Take, and he was blowing up in the city. But that was my homie. We don’t look at it like that when that’s your homie. But that n**** Slimmy, I’m in the studio. Couple days later, that n**** was texting me. He sent me a song. I didn’t have nothing going. Playing the song back after I recorded it in the garage with all the homies, they’re like, “Man, that’s hard.” I was looking back like, “Man, that sh*t was tight,” like you’re doing shit now! All my homies were recording the garage, like me, Phabo. Phabo cut a gang of records. He’s new from Soulection. We be running through here making music. First Show:My first show was at a club in San Diego called F6. My dawg Junior used to run the club on Thursday nights. I was buying a hoverboard from bro in the parking lot at the crib. I was playing some music. The homie was playing my music out of the car because I had been recording little songs when I was in college, and I used to just be freestyling on sh*t. The homie’s playing my music. He was like, “What's that?"" I'm like, “Sh*t, that's me. I be rapping.” He’s like, “Yeah?” I'm like, “Yeah, I be getting little views and sh*t like that. I play football for real, but I be rapping on the side.” He’s like, “If you ever want to perform, come to the club. I could set it up on a Thursday night.” Thursday nights be cool. I told all my homies that I had a show, and I posted it. They made me a flyer. Everybody came out at my school. Everybody I f*cked with at my school came, all the sports— basketball, football, soccer, the girls that play tennis. The line was wrapped around the club because it was so many of us, the people that were supporting me. It was lit. We packed the whole club. I only had two songs. I performed two songs like five times, and it was just rocking. It was going up, and from there on out. I was like, “Alright, let me start doing music.” Then a couple months after that, I opened up for Young Thug, and that was my real first performance at a concert venue. It was at the Observatory in San Diego. I f*cking stage-dived, and they caught me. I was like, “I want to be a rapper.” I was brought in at that point, like, “Oh my god, you stage dived.” That sh*t crazy. So that was a n**** first show.Clocking Out:Man, I watch ""Good Girls."" It’s one of my favorite shows. I be embarrassed to say it, but that's a real good show. I've met the security guard from the show. That's my homie now. I met him in the Gucci store. And I was like, “Hey, bro, you’re on Good Girls!"" He was like, “What?” Like, what the f*ck? You watch that show? I was like, “On god, that's my sh*t.” I started talking to bro about the show. We ended up being real cool. His name is Caleb [Tyler]. He ended up coming to my show at the Novo and everything right after that. I ended up making a buddy out of that. It was crazy, but I really f*ck with that show. I watch a lot of TV. TV is amazing. TV right now is really good. I see why people in the 90s were so into TV because it was actually following what was going on in their time period. Now I'm an adult, and I actually know what's going on in the world. It’s different from watching it as a kid because you don't really know. When you were a teenager, you didn't really know what was going on. You just watch the shows, but now, I can actually relate. And then on top of that, I'm making music now, and I'm actually becoming somebody, so I'm knowing people. I'm knowing the n***** in these shows, seeing n***** in the club. I’m going to the gym, seeing n***** in the gym. I’m playing in celebrity all-star games with people. My life crazy. If I had to sum it all up, this sh*t crazy. I could never have imagined living like this.Up Next:Going on tour. We already finished the TwoFr tour. It was my first headlining tour ever, so I'm extremely excited. I’ve been working out, getting in a little tour mode. I just want to make sure I'm putting on a great show. I want to leave a good taste in everybody's mouth. That sounded crazy. I just want everybody to f*ck with the show. I want everybody to love it. I want to take my showmanship seriously. That's the difference between a lot of artists— people who just be standing up on stage and looking around. I want to make sure I get out of that bubble, graduate from that and actually put a show on. I hope people are excited. I don't think that people are expecting what I got planned. Finna take it through the roof.Image provided by the artistHNHH: What do you think of the current state of LA Hip-Hop? And do you think there's a time of the past that this era feels similar to? Kalan.FrFr: I don't feel like it's ever been like anything. There are so many of us that really f*ck with each other. I don't think I've ever seen it like this — that all people that aren't from the same label, or from the same clique, or from the same group. We all from different areas, different pockets in LA, but we all come together to make sh*t happen. Everybody knows about each other because of everybody. You know what I mean? It reminds me of Atlanta, how they got sh*t going on out there. We still working out the kinks and stuff, but from this generation, everybody's messing with everybody right now. It be a little politics here and there, but for the most part, people support each other. It's nothing better than that, and we lack a lot of that in LA, so I'm glad that it's getting better. I would say it's getting way better.Whenever I listened — at least when I listened to TwoFr 2 — I noticed you mention your grandma a lot. Talk to me a little bit about her influence on your music.She influences my life. I never want to let her down. I slept in a bed with my grandmother until the moment she passed away. She died in a bed with me. It’s a connection. I feel connected to her. I can just talk to her, and damn near feel like somebody’s saying something back to me. I got to do this sh*t. I got to be the best at it. I gotta make that sh*t work. Before my grandma died, she just told me, “You could do it.” She always told me I’m a star. She was always telling me, “whatever you want to do, just do it. You could do anything.” She would sit up and watch me act like Michael Jackson for an hour, then come in the backyard and watch me play football by myself, throwing the ball up in the air. Throwing me the ball so I could play football. Like, my grandma playing catch with me and shit like that. Different shit like that. Riding my bike. Watch me go and ride my bike, helping me make a ramp in the front yard. My mama was working, so I was with my grandma all the time. Anything I ever wanted to do, she made it okay for me to do it.  A lot of things that people, in general, are lacking, starts as a child, and it starts with your parents, and it determines what you can be, how big you dream. A lot of people's parents and the world limit a lot of people's dreams, telling people what they can and cannot do and what they can and cannot be. I've never felt like I couldn't be nothing. Realistically, I knew I wasn't gonna be the president. I don't even like school. How the fuck am I gonna be president? I'm not interested in that. But if I was, I could. And if I couldn’t, then it wasn't for me. I never look at myself as a failure for trying something, because I tried, and I’mma always getting something out of it. You are always gonna get something out of something you trying. And if you not, and you continue to do it, you’re insane. That's literally the definition of insanity. My grandma, she just sit on me. She in my heart. People would think I'm crazy. I'll sit up and be talking like, “Granny, I got to do this sh*t.” They’re like, “Who are you talking to?” I can just feel her with me all the time. It's a spiritual thing. So Jay-Z calls and he gets you to sign with Roc Nation. What's the best advice he's been able to give you so far? We ain’t really had too many one-on-ones. During COVID, nobody was in the office, and then I'm from LA. Everybody's in New York. I'm just now starting to meet bro. Every time I see him, we be around a gang of people. There don’t be too much time, so I haven’t had my one-on-ones will bro yet. But when the time do come, I’ll let you know.That’s a mad surreal moment, going from listening to him in your headphones to meeting him.I didn't even know he was that tall, bro. That n**** tall. I had looked up like, “Damn.” He’s like a hooper. He got hooper size on him. That sh*t was shocking, seeing him in the office. I really admire bro, so this sh*t dope.Obviously, you’re such a fan of Kanye as well. Signing to Jay, did you ever acknowledge that parallel with Kanye’s career?Hell yeah. I posted a picture a couple months ago saying I was a Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer of the Roc. I been eating that sh*t up. That whole Kanye album with Jay talking at the end of it. Fuck you, Kanye, first and foremost. That's a dream. I would love to have Jay-Z talking at the end of my song. He don’t even got to do a feature, just say something. Who don't want that? I for sure have made the comparison, but I would never compare myself to Kanye. I’m my own guy. It’s just to have my own imagination of all of that sh*t when I was a child listening to it for the first time, and being a kid and wondering how it happened. Then thinking, “Damn, I was just with Jay-Z.” That's crazy. Like I said earlier, my life— it’s all new to me. In five years, this conversation—God willing—will be totally different. I'll be like, “Man, Jay was just over here tripping the other day at the house. We was eating crab legs. That's my n****.” But right now, this is all new to me, and I love it. Everything that comes with it, I love it.",2021-10-25 17:17:39,"Rise & Grind is a brand new editorial series, meant to introduce and dissect new, buzzing, or underground artists. Los Angeles has a hub of inspiration for music relating to the struggle, but there’s always been a balance highlighting the beauty of California. Women, weed, and weather, as Dr. Dre said on Kendrick Lamar ’s “The Recipe.” Kalan.FrFr is highlighting all those aspects. The melodies he brings speak to love and heartbreak while the guttural side of his artistry can easily soundtrack a good time. The rapper is riding high off of the release of Two.Fr 2 -- the official follow-up to his 2018 predecessor. It was a concerted choice that came after joking with the idea of using Hoochie Hotline as the title of his next project. While some of the songs did end up making it on to Two.Fr2 , the Roc Nation-signed artist explained that it felt like the right time to double back to the project that established his name. “I’m more mature now. I'm more mature as an artist,” he says. “It was just time. I had to go with what I knew. I can’t explain the feeling, but I had the feeling again. It felt like TwoFr , so it was time to go in.” With songs like “Never Lose You” having a grip on summer 2021, the future is looking quite promising for Kalan.FrFr. The rapper is hitting the road this fall for the Two Fr tour alongside Haiti Babi, Kyle Banks, and Jehkai. We chopped it up with Kalan.FrFr for the latest installment in Rise & Grind about his latest project, his love for Kanye West , and more. Stay tuned for a new installment of Rise & Grind every Monday. I'm from Carson, California and Compton. I grew up in both. My mom stayed in Carson, and my dad stayed in Compton, so I was always hella back and forth. But now I'm from all over. I represent all of LA, from the East Side to the West. I lived in all these places, and I got so much family. I’m a real LA native, all the way around. 100%. It's not really all that different [growing up between Compton and Carson] because pretty much everybody in all of these communities know each other. My cousins would be over there, I would go down, and they’d come over here, come hang out with me. Then, by the time we all started playing sports and going to junior high school and high school, everybody knew each other. I'm an Aries. I've been told that I’m every bit an Aries. Everything that they got to say about it, I’m a lot of. I ain’t a liar, though. I’m one of the cooler Aries. I be hearing a lot of Aries are liars. I don’t be lying. There ain’t no need to lie. I got past that, whatever that stage was. I’m loud as hell. You can't stop me from being loud. I’mma always feel offended. I always think somebody's trying to offend me, 100%. I’m hella sensitive, but I’ll never show it. I got way too much pride. I got pride out the window. I’m pretty much all of that, if I had to describe myself real quick. It’s not in no order, but Biggie, Jay-Z, Lil Wayne , and… I'm not gonna lie and it's early to be saying bro, but Brent Faiyaz is one of my favorite artists right now. I feel like people would have listened to him in the 80s and 90s. No matter where you threw him, I feel like his music would’ve worked. Good music don’t fade, so I'll give him that. And then I'm putting myself in there. I don’t be giving myself enough credit. I really like my own music, so I'm gonna throw myself in there. [If I couldn’t include myself, it would be] my favorite, Stevie Wonder— or Michael Jackson, of course. I don't really count Michael Jackson because to me, that's the greatest of all time. He don't even get compared to nobody. So Michael Jackson out the gate, but I put Stevie Wonder in there. He’s another one of them dudes. I ain’t even gonna use Stevie Wonder because I look at Stevie Wonder too high. Top five dead or alive, at the end, for five is Kanye, like Late Registration Kanye. That was my favorite Ye. As I got older, I just started to realize that Biggie makes great songs. From the samples to what he’s talking about, to how he’s flowing. He’s a picture painter. That sh*t is dope. I admire that. Jay— it’s Jay, bro. [Laughs] C’mon, man. Wayne’s hard. Wayne does so much. I feel like you could put Wayne on any type of beat, and he would never get boxed in. He can make a song that'll be a hit for him. All the mixtape shit he did was amazing. Brent— like I was saying, just throw him anywhere. It’s gonna work. Ye was my favorite. It kind of took a turn for me when the music started changing, like ""808s & Heartbreaks"" and sh*t like that, but I always respected it. It was always a different type of music. I love it because it's Ye, but I'm a product of my environment. I need to hear what I'm going through. That was what I was looking for: sh*t that I can relate to. So, it took a turn for me. I stopped listening to him as much. I always give him a listen. You couldn't stop me from listening to Kanye West. I used to try to dress like Kanye West. Kanye is the best ever, n****— producer and rapper. All them albums was just him being himself and pouring his emotions into the music, but it’s still uplifting. It's hard for people to do that. I strive to do that. I strive to still make you smile, no matter what I'm saying. I strive to make you feel emotions. I want this song to make you feel good. I want this song to make you feel sad. I want this song to make you think. Even if he wasn't doing it on purpose, that’s what I got from his music. That's the impact it had on me. Ye is one of the greatest to ever do it, all-time. It’s probably gonna sound crazy, but just being able to make money. I’ve been doing music for so long for nothing— not for nothing, but just to be able to do this. Being able to make money is beautiful. So many people -- it’s these people's passion. They put so much into it — so much time, so much effort, so much money — and they don't receive anything out of this. I feel hella blessed that this is all I have to do: to make music. Right now, I’m fortunate enough to take care of myself. I take care of other people. That’s the blessing within it all. This is my job at the end of the day. My job is to be myself as much as I can. I can't trade that for the world. Ain’t nobody get to go to work as happy as me. I promise you. This sh*t is happy. Even when I'm mad, I'm happy, because I'm mad about asking for more. That's usually what I'm mad about. I'm already doing well. I'm cool. Aye man, it was this or UPS. [Laughs] I'm gonna say, “Do y'all f*ck with that?” like 1000 times. That's weird. It gets to the point where homies be like, “Bro, don't ask us nothing. Just keep recording. Don't say nothing. Yes, we f*ck with it. Everybody in here nodding their head. You don't got to ask us, ‘Do we f*ck with it?’” And then sometimes, I'll make the engineer put the headphones on so can’t nobody hear it. They get mad when I do that. And 3 things I need in the studio… weed. That’s the first one. Definitely don't want to be in the studio and not be high. I don't got to get high to make music, but I would rather be high. That's cool for me. I get a lot done. If it's a late session, I need my blanket so I can curl up and listen to the music after it's done. And snacks. The snacks gotta be superior. If we send you to go get snacks, and you come back and strike out, we probably won't even smoke with you. That snack sh*t is serious. You gotta have the right snacks. The last time we went to ‘yo, we didn’t even have the right snacks. My cousin ordered some Wingstop and got naked chicken. I ain’t never seen no chicken with no seasoning— just plain chicken! That n**** crazy. [The worst snack run] I think we was in the studio in Atlanta, and n**** brought back some sunflower seeds or something like that. I'm like, “Bro, what the f*ck?” [Laughs] Some almonds or something. That’s wasn’t it, bro. You didn't get the right sh*t. From what everybody say, it’s going good. And there's always room for improvement. Honestly, I love it. I love the response I'm getting. I'm getting booked for shows, people really listening to the music, my streams going up every week. I’m extremely appreciative, and I'm appreciative that so many people rock with the music, but I'm just excited to do it again. I have so much more music. I'm working so hard. I work so much. I just want to show everybody what I got, and hopefully, just get bigger and bigger every time. With the “Hoochie Hotline”, it was gonna be a quick EP, and it was gonna be more songs catered towards women. We swapped a lot of the songs out. We added a bunch of songs. It was really a feeling. It was more, “Man, it’s time for TwoFr 2.” I was having that feeling that I had when I dropped ""TwoFr,"" and that was the tape that took off, that started my music stuff, with “Right Wit It”, and “Finance”, and “Naked”. That’s what started up my name, started making me a household name, actually putting some rank on it. So just doubling back around— this time, bigger platform, bigger music, everything's growing. I’m more mature now. I'm more mature as an artist. I've learned so much more out of being in so many situations, met people. It was just time. I had to go with what I knew. I can’t explain the feeling, but I had the feeling again. It felt like ""TwoFr,"" so it was time to go in. With Blue Bucks, them the homies. We have been recording. We have been supposed to get in the studio, been recording. Even if we don't record, we still pull up on each other. I was just like, “Bro, I got one. I’m finna put this sh*t on my tape.” Them n***** pulled up on me and knocked it out. With the song with Durk, that wasn't the original song I wanted to put Durk on. I’m blessed because I have so many other good people around me, so many people that are interested in music and have a music background. They were like, “Nah, maybe you should put him on ‘I Like.’” That was all them. That didn’t even have nothing to do with me. So we sent bro the song, bro got on there, worked it in. But me and Durk have already had music together. I f*ck with them OTF n***** heavy. We got locked in. It was cool. I be running into Durk everyday at the studio, so it ain’t nothing to get stuff done with them. Bro was f*cking with the record, too. It was dope. It probably was something stupid, something weak. I remember I used to try to rap when I was really little, and it was horrible. [Laughs] It just wasn’t it. But it was probably something about 24-inch rims. My cousin had 24-inch rims on his Denali. So it probably was that. He used to take me to school in the morning sometimes. I used to feel cool as hell getting out. He had the XL Denali, the big, long ass one, so it was probably something about that. But it was sorry, whatever it was. [Laughs] My first time ever recording was in the garage. My cousin and his homies made music for fun. He played in the league, but he used to make music. My cousin Kenan. He'd be making music with his friends. I had to be like 10, and I was like, “Let me make a song.” He was like, “Alright, you gotta do everything yourself,” so he made me make the beat, made me make the song. I did everything. I made the beat on Reason, and I recorded the song on Pro Tools. I did it with an MPC. Sh*t, that’s when I fell in love. He was walking me through [ProTools and Reason] but he made me do it myself. He was like, “I'm not finna do it for you. Drag that there.” I had rhythm and sh*t like that. I had a feel for what I was doing. I knew what I wanted to do. That's when I was into Kanye West like heavy. I was up on what was going on. I was probably in sixth grade when that sh*t happened. My garage was my studio until ""TwoFr."" I did ""TwoFr"" in my garage. I did half of it in Atlanta, and I did the other half right here in my garage. I remember doing a song with Slimmy B. All my homies was in the garage. That was my first time doing a feature with somebody that was bigger than me. Somebody I didn’t know. I had done sh*t with Jay and all of that, 1Take, and he was blowing up in the city. But that was my homie. We don’t look at it like that when that’s your homie. But that n**** Slimmy, I’m in the studio. Couple days later, that n**** was texting me. He sent me a song. I didn’t have nothing going. Playing the song back after I recorded it in the garage with all the homies, they’re like, “Man, that’s hard.” I was looking back like, “Man, that sh*t was tight,” like you’re doing shit now! All my homies were recording the garage, like me, Phabo. Phabo cut a gang of records. He’s new from Soulection. We be running through here making music. My first show was at a club in San Diego called F6. My dawg Junior used to run the club on Thursday nights. I was buying a hoverboard from bro in the parking lot at the crib. I was playing some music. The homie was playing my music out of the car because I had been recording little songs when I was in college, and I used to just be freestyling on sh*t. The homie’s playing my music. He was like, “What's that?"" I'm like, “Sh*t, that's me. I be rapping.” He’s like, “Yeah?” I'm like, “Yeah, I be getting little views and sh*t like that. I play football for real, but I be rapping on the side.” He’s like, “If you ever want to perform, come to the club. I could set it up on a Thursday night.” Thursday nights be cool. I told all my homies that I had a show, and I posted it. They made me a flyer. Everybody came out at my school. Everybody I f*cked with at my school came, all the sports— basketball, football, soccer, the girls that play tennis. The line was wrapped around the club because it was so many of us, the people that were supporting me. It was lit. We packed the whole club. I only had two songs.

Fuck you, Kanye, first and foremost. That's a dream. I would love to have Jay-Z talking at the end of my song. He don’t even got to do a feature, just say something. Who don't want that? I for sure have made the comparison, but I would never compare myself to Kanye. I’m my own guy. It’s just to have my own imagination of all of that sh*t when I was a child listening to it for the first time, and being a kid and wondering how it happened. Then thinking, “Damn, I was just with Jay-Z.” That's crazy. Like I said earlier, my life— it’s all new to me. In five years, this conversation—God willing—will be totally different. I'll be like, “Man, Jay was just over here tripping the other day at the house. We was eating crab legs. That's my n****.” But right now, this is all new to me, and I love it. Everything that comes with it, I love it.",https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/image/620x412c/cover/1635174227_a39ba6db486a9f04f4a01b6a349d8381.jpg/348b4c8b144c71313744502f5bb077f4/1635174227_79815c2ca5906e931c9976816097b7cf.jpg,realhotnewhiphop

But the surge appears to have essentially plateaued, with active case counts dropping only a few dozen a day over the past week, according to the South Dakota Department of Health, Monday, Oct. 25. There were 5,625 active COVID-19 cases in the state on Monday, down significantly from the Sept. 20 peak of 7,927, but down less than 200 cases in the past week. The active cases count measures the number of new COVID-19 cases against recoveries. That comparison is a rough tracking measure of the surge, although the state's high test positivity rate indicates there are likely many cases that are going untested and unreported. Monday brought better news on the hospitalization front, with 179 people hospitalized in South Dakota with COVID-19, down from the running average of about 200 hospitalizations. State health officials on Monday reported two additional South Dakotans had died from COVID-19, raising that count since the beginning of the pandemic to 2,220. While new COVID-19 cases have slowed, reports of fatalities have picked up, with 78 reported so far in October. The following are the state Department of Health COVID-19 case rates, deaths, hospitalizations and vaccinations tracked by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as of Monday.

The Ted Lasso star returned to the show on October 23 alongside musical guest Brandi Carlile, having appeared as a cast member between 2003 and 2015. Sudeikis’s turn as host saw the show increase its ratings from last weekend, which was hosted by Rami Malek, as it drew in a 3.7 household live + same-day rating in 41 metered local markets, as well as 1.6 in the 18-49 demographic in 22 markets with local people meters (via Deadline). By contrast, Malek’s turn drew in 3.4 and 1.3, respectively, though Sudeikis’s episode was slightly down on the previous hosting turn by Kim Kardashian a few weeks ago, which took in 3.8, and an equal 1.6 in the latter markets. As part of his episode, Sudeikis joked about the success of his Apple TV+ series Ted Lasso, admitting in his opening monologue that it was “truly shocking to me because it’s built around two things Americans hate: soccer and kindness”. He also quipped about the advice current Saturday Night Live cast members had asked him for, saying: “Honestly, I found myself giving the same advice to every single person – win an Emmy. “And if you can, win two. Double up, that’s the best way to do it. It sets you up for success, I’ve found.” During his episode, Sudeikis revived his famous impression of Joe Biden from the Obama era alongside current cast member James Austin Johnson’s take on the US president, as well as that of Alex Moffat. Saturday Night Live will take a week off before returning with host Kieran Culkin, with Ed Sheeran scheduled to appear as musical guest. However, it is unclear whether Sheeran will still perform after he tested positive for COVID-19 over the weekend.

Health Secretary Sajid Javid will tell NHS leaders to allow a third shot five months after a second dose instead of six as he aims to protect people from coronavirus this winter, The Mail on Sunday reported. Earlier this week, he urged eligible people to get a booster jab and the flu vaccine as he warned cases could hit 100,000 a day this winter. But at the moment, those eligible for a booster jab cannot book in advance and must wait an average of 18 days after the six months to get an appointment for a third vaccination. This is one of the reasons only approximately 4.5 million out of the 9.3 million people who qualify for the booster have received one, The Mail on Sunday added. The newspaper said Government sources had promised the new rules would be put in place as soon as possible, allowing eligible people to book a month in advance. Those eligible for boosters include anyone aged 50 and over, people living and working in care homes for the elderly, and frontline health and social care workers. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has urged eligible people to get a booster jab. (AFP) The Prime Minister’s advisors have also considered shortening the six-month window for a booster, but the current time is the optimum period to maximise immunity levels. Boris Johnson and senior health chiefs are also calling on the nation to get vaccinated against COVID-19 amid mounting concern over rising infection levels ahead of Christmas. The PM said vaccines would get the country through the winter and out of the pandemic, while NHS England’s national medical director Professor Stephen Powis said getting a booster will “protect the freedom and Christmas that we have all earned”. The repeated calls for people to get jabbed comes as Mr Johnson resists pleas from health leaders for tighter restrictions despite the rising number of cases. Downing Street insisted there was still spare capacity in the NHS and that Plan B would only be activated if it came under “significant pressure”. Plan B includes working-from-home guidance and the mandatory use of face masks. Boris Johnson has called on the nation to get vaccinated (Reuters) Mr Johnson, who has said there are no plans for another lockdown, said: “Vaccines are our way through this winter. Prof Powis, who said this week that the NHS feels “exceptionally busy”, has written in the Sunday Telegraph that it will “no doubt be a tough winter”. He said this time last year there were more than 6,800 people in hospital with Covid, and this weekend the figure is 6,405, but in 2020 the nation was still six weeks away from the world’s first vaccination. Mr Javid is also said to be ready to enforce laws to make Covid vaccines mandatory for people working for the NHS.  The calls for people to get their boosters come after Professor Peter Openshaw, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said case numbers and death rates are currently “unacceptable”.

The survey was released on Monday and included 680 parents of children five to 11. On Tuesday, FDA senior officials are meant to hold a discussion on whether to approve the vaccine for this age cohort. Specifically, the survey showed that 48% of parents are sure or think they will get their kids the jab, 23% will definitely not vaccinate their children and 29% are still undecided. ""Right now, when morbidity is not high, it is important to get children as early as possible to prevent or reduce the next wave,” said Meuhedet Chief Nursing Officer Mali Kusha. Among those who said they will not vaccinate their children, 37% said it is due to concerns that the vaccine could have negative health impacts on their kid in the long run. Some 18% said they feel they are lacking evidence on the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine. Also, 11% said they simply don’t want their child vaccinated, while 7% said they assume their child will catch the virus and then be naturally protected. Kusha said that more than one-third of parents said they would consult with their pediatrician about vaccination and another 23% said they are waiting to read articles on the subject. “We have no doubt that extensive information is required here both in the media and through pediatricians who have direct and continuous contact with families,” Kusha said. The Meuhedet survey is one of a few surveys conducted in recent weeks ahead of the pending decision by the FDA. A WOMAN RECEIVES her third anti-COVID vaccination at a Clalit Health Fund center in Jerusalem. (credit: MARC ISRAEL SELLEM/THE JERUSALEM POST) A survey completed at the beginning of this month by Bar-Ilan University found that the majority (57%) of Jewish Israeli parents of children five to11 will get their children vaccinated if the FDA approves the vaccine. The survey was carried out by Dr. Liora Shmueli of the school’s Program for Public Health and Health Systems Management and included a representative sample of 894 of the country’s Jewish parents. Some 27% of parents said they would vaccinate their kids within less than one month of the jab being available, and 27% said they would vaccinate within one to three months. The rest said that they would wait four months to more than a year, or that they would not vaccinate their children at all. Briefing documents released over the weekend by FDA scientists indicated they are likely to approve the vaccine for this age cohort. In the documents, it said that the scientists believe the likely benefits of giving the Pfizer vaccine to young children outweigh the risks. If the FDA votes favorably, the Centers for Disease Control will meet on November 2-3 to make its recommendations on how the shots should be administered. Israel is expected to follow and approve the shots a few weeks later.",,jpost

By virtue of Republic Act 10661, the NCM is an annual celebration which commemorates the significance of the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) by the United Nations (UN) General Assembly on November 20, 1989. It also aims to strengthen the call for public awareness and support in protecting and promoting the rights of children. The month-long activity highlights the theme, “New Normal na Walang Iwanan: Karapatan ng Bawat Bata Ating Tutukan!” The theme aims to give attention to the difficulties experienced by children in the new normal setting such as concerns on their rights to survival, development, protection, and participation. Likewise, the celebration will continue with the gains of the previous NCM celebrations which is anchored on the 3rd National Plan of Action for Children (NPAC) Goals to progressively realize the rights of children.

Holocaust Survivors return to Germany on March of the Living,https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/holocaust-survivors-return-to-germany-on-march-of-the-living-683098,,,,The first delegation of March of the Living since the COVID-19 pandemic began arrived in Berlin on Tuesday.,,2021-10-25 22:58:54,"The “March of the Living,” a dedicated to exploring the remnants and history of the Holocaust, has finally resumed after a nearly two-year hiatus. A British delegation comprised of four Holocaust survivors and around 80 participants — Jews and non-Jews alike — visited Berlin, Ravensbruck Concentration Camp for women and children and the infamous Bergen-Belsen camp, where Anne Frank's gravestone is located. The Holocaust survivors who led the delegation were Mala Tribich, Eve Kugler, Alfred Garwood, and Harry (Chaim) Olmer, all of whom live in Britain. March of the Living trips worldwide typically bring Holocaust survivors along with the group in order to deepen the young participants' understanding of the horrors and wrongdoings committed during the Holocaust. Tribich was imprisoned in when she was 14 years old and was transferred to Bergen-Belsen a few months after. “It took us a number of days to arrive by train. I was 14,” she told the delegation. “I remember the camp was very organized. We got here and our heads were shaved. We all looked the same. Within seconds, they took our identity. This is one of the hardest moments I can remember.” Alfred Garwood, another of the four survivors, was also imprisoned at Bergen-Belsen. “I was born into the war and was almost 4 years old when I was liberated,” Garwood explained. “Children were with their mothers, and I survived in part because my mother managed to breastfeed me. It was a miracle. There were a lot of children in the camp. We played near the corpses. We suffered quietly. The ones who cried were killed. My friends died next to me.” The March of the Living was established in 1988 and had taken place every year since until the COVID-19 pandemic began. Thousands of participants from across the world join trips to Poland where they explore the history of the Holocaust – along with the harrowing remnants of Nazi infrastructure, such as the infamous concentration camps Auschwitz Birkenau and Bergen-Belsen.

(credit: REUTERS) The purpose of educating youth about the Holocaust is not only to teach history but also to warn of the atrocities our fellow human beings are capable of. “It hurts a lot to be back here, but I admit I had to do it, even if only to remember the victims. I feel that if we do not mention them, they will be forgotten as if they never lived. As the generations go by, this is the way to make sure the victims are not forgotten,” Tribich added. Garwood felt the same way: “I'm coming back here today to tell the story of myself, my family, and many victims. That memory will never be forgotten.”",,jpost

(Picture: REX) Last year’s series of I’m a Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here was a bit different than usual. Due to the Covid pandemic, 2020’s show was filmed in cold conditions in a Welsh castle. Even though it had been based in the sunny, bug-packed Australian jungle since the show’s inception in 2002. ITV will be taking us back to Wales with a new line-up of celebrity campmates for 2021, due to ongoing Australia travel restrictions – and we absolutely can’t wait. But let’s recap on the most recent series first. Who won the last series of I’m a Celebrity? Let’s refresh your memory. Who won I’m a Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here 2020? A cast of 12 British stars travelled to freezing Gwrych Castle in Wales, with only one emerging as Queen of the Castle. It was… author and podcaster Giovanna Fletcher! Winner Giovanna with presenters Ant & Dec with the National Television Award (Picture: Dave J Hogan/Getty Images) Mum blogger Giovanna – who shares sons Buzz, Buddy and Max with McFly singer Tom Fletcher – won over the public’s affection for her warm and caring nature. She was often a shoulder to cry on, or a listening ear, for the other celebrities throughout the show. The finale episode saw Giovanna win the biggest share of a whopping 12 million votes – with some of those going to runner-up Jordan North, a BBC1 radio host. Vernon Kay, presenter of All Star Family Fortunes and other ITV game/reality shows, came in a respectable third place. Meanwhile, some of the longest-surviving campmates were EastEnders icon Shane Ritchie, Olympic champion Sir Mo Farah and ex-Strictly dancer AJ Pritchard. EastEnders actor Jessica Plummer, opera star Russell Watson and news broadcaster Victoria Derbyshire managed to outstay co-stars Beverley Callard of Coronation Street fame, theatre performer Ruthie Henshall and Paralympian Hollie Arnold – who went home first. Unfortunately, Giovanna didn’t receive the title ‘Queen of the Jungle’ – due to the obvious lack of an Australian jungle. But she was crowned the first-ever ‘Queen of the Castle’ (with a crown and sceptre) in the last moments of the 2020 series. When does the 2021 series of I’m a Celebrity start? It’s almost time for Giovanna to hand her crown over to the 2021 champion.

Seattle's Pike Place Market struggles to find footing since COVID-19,https://www.startribune.com/seattles-pike-place-market-struggles-to-find-footing-since-covid-19/600109609/,,"['Paul Roberts', ' Seattle Times']",,,,2021-10-24 19:00:00,"Like many vendors at Pike Place Market in Seattle, Scott Chang isn't sure when business will resume its pre-COVID normal. True, this summer brought welcome crowds of tourists and locals to the open-air Seattle landmark. Sales at See Lee Gardens, the flower business owned by Chang's family, are nearly back where they were before the pandemic shuttered the market's picturesque warren of stalls and shops. But there's another, more somber reason for See Lee's rebound: Several competing flower vendors haven't come back to the market, or are only there a few days a week. They now sell at other outlets that don't require the long commute into downtown Seattle. Even Chang, for the first time, is selling some of his flowers elsewhere, partly as a hedge against future COVID-related disruptions. ""We're never going to quit Pike Place,"" says Chang, 36, of the place that has hosted his family business since the 1980s. But the pandemic ""was a big eye-opener that we have to look for other venues."" Fifty years after Pike Place Market was nearly razed in the name of progress, the sprawling institution faces another, even more complex nemesis. Although many of the market's more than 500 businesses saw solid sales this summer, visitor numbers are still below their 2019 levels. Many vendors and farmers are still on reduced hours, and dozens haven't returned or are squarely on the fence about coming back. Though most of the market's 222 restaurants, shops and other brick-and-mortar tenants are back, just 69 of 96 farmers and 147 of 186 crafters had returned as of Oct. 6, market officials said. All told, the market's business community is still down by around 15% from 2019. ""It truly is up in the air right now,"" says Jim Johnson, owner of Olympia-based Johnson Berry Farm, a 22-year market stalwart that hasn't been back since last fall. Even many of those vendors who have made it back did so by shifting how — and sometimes where — they do business as they prepare for their second pandemic winter. Collectively, it points to changes for an iconic, eclectic retail community that was facing challenges before COVID, including labor shortages and competition from online retailers and from a proliferation of farmers markets in virtually every town and neighborhood. Although Pike Place Market remains the region's go-to source for a fully immersive ""meet the producer"" experience, ""we can't live on it alone,"" says Mary Bacarella, executive director of the Pike Place Market Preservation and Development Authority (PDA), which owns and manages the 9-acre, 14-building complex. The market, Bacarella, ""has to adapt."" Revenue for the PDA, which charges some tenants a percentage of retail sales, fell from a record $22.6 million in 2019 to $13.2 million in 2020, leading to cost-cutting and layoffs of 15% of its staff. The PDA offered tenants $3.7 million in rental assistance. The market's fundraising arm, the Pike Place Market Foundation, offered nearly $700,000 in small-business grants. Paycheck Protection Program loans helped. Individual businesses, meanwhile, came up with their own adaptations. At the Sound View Cafe, Alex Amon, whose family purchased the place almost 30 years ago, completely re-engineered the menu, replacing many complicated higher-end items with simpler selections that ""were more cost-efficient for us."" Like retailers everywhere, many market vendors also found ways to rely less on face-to-face sales. But some vendors also found ways to reduce their reliance on the market itself. ""To help pick up the slack"" in sales, Holmquist Hazelnut Orchards stepped up sales at 16 other regional farmers markets, many of which were thriving even as Pike Place struggled, said co-owner Richard Holmquist. For some of the market's older vendors, the pandemic was simply a good moment to retire. Vickie Clark Rafael, a 66-year-old jeweler in Shoreline, has operated a day stall for more than 40 years. Though she hasn't returned since the pandemic struck, she had planned to stay on until 70, but is now unsure. ""This whole COVID reality has made things so challenging to decide what to do,"" she says.",,startribune
What a pediatrician says about the COVID vaccine for kids,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-vaccine-kids-pediatrician-questions-answers/,,,,"Former acting CDC Director Dr. Richard Besser, pediatrician and President of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, weighs in on new guidelines for 5-11 year olds.",,2021-10-25 16:16:51,"Children aged 5 to 11 will soon be able to get a COVID-19 vaccine at their pediatrician's office, local pharmacy and potentially even their school, the White House announced on Wednesday as it detailed plans for the expected authorization of the Pfizer shot for younger children in a matter of weeks. Federal regulators will meet over the next two weeks to weigh the benefits of giving shots to kids, after lengthy studies meant to ensure the safety of the vaccines. So what does this mean for families and the fight against COVID-19 ? Here's what Dr. Richard Besser, former acting CDC director and president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, told ""Face the Nation."" The White House has announced plans to distribute vaccines for 5-11 year olds. As a pediatrician, how soon can parents expect to have their kids vaccinated? If the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorizes the use of this vaccine in children and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends it, vaccines could be available by early November. As both a pediatrician and a parent, I'm looking forward to having a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine for young children. While we can all be grateful that they are at less risk of severe disease, the impact of the pandemic on children has been profound. • More than 6 million children in the U.S. have gotten COVID-19, including more than 1.1 million in the last six weeks alone. • More than 600 children have died from COVID-19, 158 of whom have been between the ages of 5 and 11. • More than 5,000 children have gotten a severe multisystem inflammatory condition known as MIS-C following a COVID-19 diagnosis, which can have debilitating physical effects. Children who haven't gotten COVID-19 directly have still been hit hard by this virus. More than 140,000 children have lost a parent or caregiver, while long-term school closures and lockdowns have negatively affected children's social, emotional, and mental health. Across the board, children of color and those from low-income families have suffered disproportionately from COVID-19. Fortunately, we're moving closer to a vaccine for younger children. Here's how it works: On October 26th, the FDA's independent advisory committee on vaccines, known as VRBPAC, will meet to decide whether to recommend a vaccine for kids in this age group. If the FDA ultimately authorizes that vaccine, the CDC's independent advisory committee, known as ACIP, is scheduled to meet on November 2nd and 3rd to make recommendations on who should get it; the CDC director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, would then need to announce her official recommendations before any vaccines for children are administered. If that timeline holds, and both the FDA and CDC give the green light, we would probably see the first shots going in kids' arms within days of the CDC's official recommendation being announced. It is critically important from both a health and trust standpoint that we allow this process to play out rather than simply assuming the vaccine will be authorized. The FDA, the CDC, and their respective independent agencies must undertake a thorough and independent review to determine whether the vaccine is safe and effective for children in this age group. The data that have been released to date are promising, but independent scientific review must guide this process. The Biden administration is planning to push vaccines out through many channels including doctors offices, local pharmacies, and schools. They aren't planning on doing mass vaccination clinics like we saw for adults. Will this do enough to ensure vaccines go to the most vulnerable or needy of school aged children? I'm excited about the approach that is being taken. The Biden administration has announced that it has purchased enough vaccines for the 28 million children in the U.S. who are in the 5-11 age group. They are working with states and localities to plan for vaccines to be distributed to all communities. It makes a lot of sense to provide shots in settings where children are used to being vaccinated, such as their doctor's offices where trust levels are high. As a pediatrician, I am used to vaccinating children and answering questions from caregivers every single time I'm in the clinic. But we also know that many children do not have health insurance or their own healthcare provider: the latest figures show that 5.6% of children were uninsured in 2020, but the uninsured rate is nearly twice as high for children in poverty. That's why vaccination clinics at other places, such as hospitals, pharmacies, health centers, and schools, are all essential to reach children in all neighborhoods. Moreover, it is critical that public health officials collect data on race, ethnicity, and neighborhood so that any disparities in vaccine uptake can be documented and addressed. We also need to make it as easy as possible for parents to get their children vaccinated and stay home with them if side effects keep some kids out of school for a day. Unfortunately, in the United States, people's access to paid leave benefits largely depends on their job and income level. We are the only wealthy nation that does not guarantee any paid leave for new parents or to care for a sick family member. Black, Latino and Indigenous people are much more likely to work in minimum wage jobs that don't provide paid leave. Emergency legislation passed by Congress has incentivized more employers to offer paid leave benefits, including time off for vaccination, but temporary tax credits for that purpose have expired and approximately 100 million workers remain without any paid leave at all. The idea that any parent would have to choose between earning a paycheck and getting their children a potentially life-saving vaccine is just wrong. It is well past time for the United States to establish a national paid leave program that covers all workers while taking meaningful steps to ensure working families have quality and affordable child care options. What would you tell parents who are still unsure about the COVID-19 vaccine? It is understandable that parents would have questions and concerns about any new vaccine. Polling shows that parents are split on COVID-19 vaccines for children: some plan to get their children vaccinated right away; some have no intention of doing so at all; and some prefer to take a ""wait and see"" approach. We have seen these divergent viewpoints play out with vaccines for both adults and adolescents, so it is not a surprise to see it with younger children as well, especially since the clinical trials for children at this age level were far smaller than those conducted for adults. As a pediatrician, I've spent many hours counseling parents on vaccines for children. Just a few days ago, in the clinic where I still see patients, I talked with a mother about vaccines for her teenage sons. She wants to see more data before she makes her decision. We had an open and respectful conversation. In my experience, pressuring and berating people doesn't work. The first step is to listen; it's important that we give people the time and space to ask questions and have their concerns heard. Parents should bring those questions or concerns to a healthcare provider or others they trust to get accurate information. Vaccine misinformation is rampant and its continued spread ultimately disrespects and endangers those who may have legitimate questions for which they're seeking honest answers. The approach that is being planned for administering COVID-19 vaccines to younger children will make it easier for these conversations to happen. While kids are at a lower risk of COVID complications, how should parents of young children, infants and up to 5 years old, approach the virus? While it is cause for optimism that caseloads have dropped significantly in recent weeks, they remain extremely high, and the U.S. is still averaging approximately 1,500 deaths per day. I don't believe we will truly get a handle on this pandemic unless and until safe and effective vaccines are available for all age groups and until more adults decide to get vaccinated. It's important to remember that even if vaccines are authorized for children ages 5-11, children under age 5 still won't be vaccine-eligible, and they are likely to remain ineligible until early 2022 at the earliest. One of those most important steps we can take to protect children ineligible for vaccination is to ensure that the adults around them are fully vaccinated. There are currently about 66 million vaccine-eligible people in the United States who remain unvaccinated. In places where vaccination rates are particularly low, those communities remain especially susceptible to additional cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. Achieving a higher vaccination rate across the board is the most important step we can take to save lives. There are other steps we can take to keep our youngest children safe. The CDC recommends that everyone age 2 and up in schools and child care facilities wear masks. That's an essential component of keeping kids, teachers, and staff safe, and increasing the chances that these facilities will be able to operate safely and stay open. The CDC also recommends that everybody ages six months and up gets a flu shot. That is incredibly important. In a typical flu season, thousands of young children are hospitalized from the flu, and we're already starting to see some respiratory viruses circulate earlier than usual this year with kids back in schools and child care facilities. Flu shots save lives and ease the strain on hospitals and other healthcare providers. Do you envision a future of a COVID vaccine or booster being part of routine childhood immunizations like the polio vaccine any time soon? Vaccines have been a part of my professional career for decades. There is nothing I do as a pediatrician that has more proven health value than working to ensure that all of my patients are fully vaccinated on time. Every state requires vaccinations for children to attend school. Vaccination rates for required immunizations, such as measles, mumps, and rubella, tend to be extremely high. We have seen a growing number of vaccine mandates in workplace settings across the country, which I think is the right move. We're even seeing this among younger populations; some schools already require COVID-19 vaccines for certain older children, such as high school student-athletes. While all three COVID-19 vaccines available in the U.S. are extremely effective at preventing severe disease, hospitalization, and deaths, only Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine has been granted full approval by the FDA to date, and only for those ages 16 and up. Over time, as the evidence base around vaccine efficacy and safety continues to build, we may see more full approvals granted by the FDA, and for younger age groups. Additional full approvals may well lead COVID-19 vaccines to eventually being recommended as part of the CDC's routine childhood immunization schedule, and would likely lead to greater numbers of states and localities adopting COVID-19 vaccine requirements.

Trudeau uses pandemic-plagued supply chains in free trade pitch to ASEAN,http://www.timescolonist.com/trudeau-uses-pandemic-plagued-supply-chains-in-free-trade-pitch-to-asean-1.24366018,,,,"OTTAWA — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau used the spectre of gnarled global supply chains in a bid Sunday to a bloc of Southeast Asian nations to win them over on a free trade deal.Trudeau has long sought a trade deal with the 10-nation bloc, which includes the Philippines, Indonesia, Brunei, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Burma.He told a virtual business summit organized by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations that a free trade agreement with Canada would be a ""win-win"" for all sides, particularly coming out of the pandemic.Speaking in a pre-recorded message, Trudeau argued that an agreement with ASEAN would help companies and entrepreneurs build connections and business relationships around the world. He also said a pact would give investors more confidence to invest in international markets, and protect supply chains from the uncertainties brought by COVID-19.Trade bottlenecks across the globe have been slower to recover than consumer demand for goods, and slowed further by ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks and public health measures.All this affects inventories of in-demand consumer products or the delivery of parts needed to build things like cars, and pushes up transportation costs that get passed on to consumers, which is reflected in higher inflation rates.""As we finish the fight against COVID-19, deepening our ties with ASEAN economies and diversifying trade across the Asia-Pacific will play a crucial role in our recovery,"" Trudeau said in his address. ""My friends, a strong Canada-ASEAN relationship is a clear win-win for all of our businesses and all of our people.""The economies of the 10-nation bloc as a group represent Canada's sixth largest trading partner, but the country already has access to four ASEAN members — Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam — through a Pacific Rim trade pact known as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).The Liberals' election platform promised a new hub to help businesses take advantage of opportunities under CPTPP, and a new Asia-Pacific strategy aimed at deepening ties in the region, including new trade deals.A preliminary analysis by ASEAN and the federal government on the merits of a free trade deal estimated Canadian exports of goods and services to the bloc could go up by 13.3 per cent, valued at US$2.67 billionIn his address, Trudeau said both sides must also ensure women, Indigenous people, LGBTQ entrepreneurs, visible minorities and other under-represented business owners get involved in and benefit from trade.This report by The Canadian Press was first published Oct. 24, 2021.",,2021-10-25 02:52:39,,https://images.glaciermedia.ca/polopoly_fs/1.24366019.1635134936!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_300/20211024221040-6176199866bb5628894ab5adjpeg-jpg.jpg,timescolonist

KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 25 — Fitch Solutions has revised Malaysia’s 2021 growth forecast to 1.5 per cent from its earlier estimate 0 per cent.This comes as Malaysia’s daily Covid-19 cases have slipped from a peak of 24,599 on August 26 to just 6,210 on October 21 with a downtrend that appears to be entrenched coupled with the reopening of international travels to Langkawi most recently.In a brief commentary today, the research unit of the Fitch Group noted that its previous forecasts had assumed that Covid-19 restrictions would not be removed until daily cases fell below 4,000.“In view of these positive developments, we at Fitch Solutions have revised upward our 2021 real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth forecast from 0.0 per cent to 1.5 per cent. “Our forecast for 2022 remains at 5.5 per cent for now, with the economy likely to post a stronger recovery thanks to higher vaccination rates,” it said.With the improving situation, Fitch Solutions opined the government will now probably be able to honour its pledge to fully reopen the economy by this month’s end as the removal of domestic restrictions will provide a strong boost to the retail and services sector over the remainder of the year.It also cited Google’s mobility data which revealed a sharp improvement in foot traffic to retail outlets, parks and workplaces as restrictions have been gradually lifted by the government.“This means that Third Quarter 2021 is likely to have performed better in terms of private consumption than we previously expected and the revision reflects this. Having said that, Fitch Solutions later emphasised that the revision was a preliminary adjustment as it awaits a clearer indication as to the health of the economy with the release of Third Quarter 2021 real GDP growth results on November 12. “That said, we continue to caution that downside risks remain, particularly the possibility that the removal of restrictions will result in a surge in infections that forces the government to pause reopening plans. “In neighbouring Singapore, for example, the government was forced to reimplement tighter restrictions in late September. “If the Malaysian authorities are forced to abandon their reopening plan, this would delay the economic recovery into 2022,” it said.",2021-10-25 05:06:42,,,malaymail

Games participants will need to be tested for COVID-19 before arrival, and athletes and team officials must be vaccinated to avoid 21 days in quarantine, with some exceptions for medical reasons granted on a case-by-case basis. “We want everyone at the Games to be safe, that’s why we’re asking all participants to follow these guidelines,” IOC Olympic Games Executive Director Christophe Dubi said in a statement. “Keeping everyone healthy will ensure the focus remains on the very fundamentals of the Olympic and Paralympic Games – the athletes and the sport.” Organizers added that the closed loop system has been designed to keep competitors safe by reducing unnecessary interactions. Competitors will also be encouraged to wear masks and avoid spaces that are enclosed, crowded or involve close contact while every organization taking part in the Games will be asked to nominate COVID-19 Liaison Officers. Vaccination is not mandatory for the Beijing Games but some national Olympic committees, including that of the United States and Canada, are requiring team members to be vaccinated.

Fauci says vaccines for kids between 5 and 11 likely available in November,https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/anthony-fauci-covid-19-vaccines-kids-likely-available-november,,['Reuters'],,"Once authorized, roughly 28 million more children in the United States would be eligible to receive what would be the first US COVID-19 vaccine for younger kids","Vaccines for kids between the ages of 5 and 11 will likely be available in the first half of November, top US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said on Sunday, October 24, predicting a timetable that could see many kids getting fully vaccinated before the end of the year. “If all goes well, and we get the regulatory approval and the recommendation from the CDC, it’s entirely possible if not very likely that vaccines will be available for children from 5 to 11 within the first week or two of November,” Fauci said in an interview with ABC’s This Week.

The FDA typically follows the advice of its panel but is not required to do so. Advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will weigh in on recommendations for the vaccine at a meeting on November 2 and November 3, helping to inform a final decision by its director. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, speaking at Fox News Sunday, also said the agency wanted to act swiftly. “After they (FDA) are able to review all the science and conduct the regulatory action and the CDC will meet, and if all of that goes smoothly … we will act quickly,” she said. “We know how many parents are interested in getting their children between 5 and 11 vaccinated and we intend to act as quickly as we can,” she added. Once authorized, roughly 28 million more children in the United States would be eligible to receive what would be the first US COVID-19 vaccine for younger kids. The Pfizer/BioNTech shot is already available to those ages 12-17, and the companies are still studying it for children younger than 5. While children have a lower rate of death from COVID-19, many face illness and long-term symptoms that are still being studied. Many adults who have been hesitant or opposed to the COVID-19 vaccine, and even some who did not oppose the vaccine for themselves, are expected to resist giving the shot to their children. Asked if schools should mandate a vaccine for kids, Walensky said: “Right now we are at authorization. We’re having discussions about authorization.

Charlotte cuddles a new addition to the family – Nova. We thought about a replacement and, selfishly I suppose, I kept the pressure on until Connie gave in and we went down to Tipperary to pick up our new pet, a Retriever/Husky mix christened Nova by my daughter Charlotte.

It’s crystal clear that I’m not going to get better. But my COPD [Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease] has, so far, developed relatively slowly. Hopefully, that growth on my lung will have the manners to do the same. I’m realistic and pragmatic and we’re well prepared. But that doesn’t mean I have any plan to shuffle off in the near future. I intend to watch rugby, listen to music, moan about my health and say a few prayers for a while yet.

Halo Infinite’s new campaign trailer has Master Chief chasing Cortana,https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744558/halo-infinite-campaign-overview-preview-trailer-master-chief-xbox-series-x,,['Chaim Gartenberg'],,,"Microsoft has finally revealed a new look at Halo Infinite’s campaign mode, marking the first time that developer 343 Industries has shown the campaign since its initial gameplay reveal in July 2020. The new six-minute trailer shows off a lot of Infinite’s new gameplay and systems in a short amount of time, including new weapons, new enemies, menacing bosses, and a new AI companion character that will be accompanying players called “The Weapon.” The overview also shows off some of Infinite’s new open world gameplay and RPG style gameplay additions, which include optional bases and objectives for players to pursue and selectable upgrades for equipment. Set after 2015’s Halo 5: Guardians, Infinite is the first mainline Halo game in over five years and will look to pick up the story of the artificial intelligence revolution led by Master Chief’s former ally Cortana that served as Halo 5’s cliffhanger. Infinite will also pick up story threads from 2017’s real-time strategy spinoff Halo Wars 2, which introduced the latest strain of Halo’s classic Covenant antagonists, the Brute-led “Banished.” Halo Infinite’s initial gameplay reveal was viewed by many as underwhelming, spawning disappointment in the purportedly next-gen visuals and the infamous “Craig” meme that dunked on a close-up shot of a particularly poorly rendered Brute. With Halo Infinite set to launch in just a few weeks on December 8th, the new campaign overview isn’t just a chance for 343 Industries to give players a better idea of what to expect from the game when it arrives, but also a chance for redemption and to better sell fans on Infinite’s potential after its lackluster first impression. While 343 Industries has largely been keeping Halo Infinite’s campaign under wraps (until today’s reveal, at least), the studio has been letting players try out Infinite’s free-to-play multiplayer mode in a series of preview weekends. These weekends have had a far more positive reception as an exciting evolution (and in many ways, a return to form) for the franchise. Halo Infinite was originally intended to launch alongside the Xbox Series X and Series S last fall, but the game was delayed to 2021 due to a variety of development challenges, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. It’s now set to arrive on PC, Xbox Series X / S, and Xbox One platforms on December 8th, although the game will ship without a few key features, including the campaign’s co-op mode and the popular Forge multiplayer map editor, both of which are slated for a 2022 release in a future update.",2021-10-25 13:16:33,,,theverge

Promoting the vaccines for Nicaraguans, Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez wrote in a post on Twitter that “the solidarity and brotherhood of Hondurans crosses borders.” He added that up to 500 doses were being given out daily to Nicaraguans. Honduran health authorities also pitched the cross-border assistance as a way to help beat back the risk of more infections at home. “They don’t have access to vaccines in Nicaragua and that becomes a risk for us due to the significant movement of people along the border,” said Honduran regional health official Jose Maria Paguada. Officials in Nicaragua did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The border vaccines doled out in Honduras’ southwestern Choluteca department utilize donated inoculations made by Moderna and Pfizer, and will go through Nov. 6 for first doses, with second doses to follow, Honduran officials said. To date, Honduras has confirmed more than 370,000 coronavirus infections and nearly 10,200 deaths as a result of the highly contagious respiratory disease caused by the virus.

Trudeau has long sought a trade deal with the 10-nation bloc, which includes the Philippines, Indonesia, Brunei, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Burma. He told a virtual business summit organized by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations that a free trade agreement with Canada would be a “win-win” for all sides, particularly coming out of the pandemic. Speaking in a pre-recorded message, Trudeau argued that an agreement with ASEAN would help companies and entrepreneurs build connections and business relationships around the world. He also said a pact would give investors more confidence to invest in international markets, and protect supply chains from the uncertainties brought by COVID-19. Trade bottlenecks across the globe have been slower to recover than consumer demand for goods, and slowed further by ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks and public health measures. All this affects inventories of in-demand consumer products or the delivery of parts needed to build things like cars, and pushes up transportation costs that get passed on to consumers, which is reflected in higher inflation rates. “As we finish the fight against COVID-19, deepening our ties with ASEAN economies and diversifying trade across the Asia-Pacific will play a crucial role in our recovery,” Trudeau said in his address. “My friends, a strong Canada-ASEAN relationship is a clear win-win for all of our businesses and all of our people.” The economies of the 10-nation bloc as a group represent Canada’s sixth largest trading partner, but the country already has access to four ASEAN members — Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam — through a Pacific Rim trade pact known as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). The Liberals’ election platform promised a new hub to help businesses take advantage of opportunities under CPTPP, and a new Asia-Pacific strategy aimed at deepening ties in the region, including new trade deals. A preliminary analysis by ASEAN and the federal government on the merits of a free trade deal estimated Canadian exports of goods and services to the bloc could go up by 13.3 per cent, valued at US$2.67 billion In his address, Trudeau said both sides must also ensure women, Indigenous people, LGBTQ entrepreneurs, visible minorities and other under-represented business owners get involved in and benefit from trade.

"While Headline Tours Struggle, Festivals Fuel the Concert Biz Comeback",https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/touring/9650608/concert-attendence-down-festivals/,"['Festivals', 'Touring', 'bbpro', 'BottleRock', 'Coronavirus']",['Dave Brooks'],,"This fall the Eagles, Billy Joel and others have seen no-show rates as high as 25% for some concerts -- but outdoor festivals are a brightspot for the touring business.","BottleRock has made playing until the plug gets pulled a rite of passage at their annual Napa, Calif., festival, where the event’s 10 pm curfew is enforced with a kill switch. The sudden loss of amplified sound can be jarring, but when the crowd chimes in to close out song, like they did during this year’s Guns N’ Roses set, bellowing together “Oh, won’t you please take me ho-ome,” the inevitable viral video is marketing gold for the following year’s ticket sales. This year, the high-energy close may have served as a confidence booster for the hard rock band, which recently made its post-pandemic return to the road to play 25 shows postponed from its 2020 tour, as well as 14 new ones in nearby markets. The act’s last big series of concerts was the Not in this Lifetime tour, which made $500 million starting in spring 2016 and became the fourth-highest-grossing in history, according to Billboard Boxscore. Since the concert business started again, however, it is having a hard time getting fans to show up. On average, 10% of fans who bought tickets to see Guns N’ Roses in 2019 and 2020 are coming to its shows, and performances planned for later this year in Mexico and Europe have been pushed back to 2022, amid worries about weak walkup sales. {""nid"":""9648655"",""type"":""post"",""title"":""Live Nation Stock Is Trading Over $100.

This fall, the Eagles, Billy Joel, George Strait, Zac Brown and James Taylor have seen no-show rates as high as 25% for some concerts. Industry executives blame persistent fears about the spread of COVID-19 in indoor venues, even among those who are vaccinated, as well as competition with a flood of other concerts, festivals and destination events. Even for shows that sold out already, that means fewer bodies in seats, as well as waker food, beverage and merchandise sales – plus a blow to the ability to bookers and promoters to plan ahead. Festivals like BottleRock, which sold out “in a matter of minutes” this year company officials say, are a bright spot in the post-pandemic music business, with the majority of such events increasing their attendance over 2019 levels, according to Live Nation’s most recent earnings report. One reason: Outdoor festivals are perceived to be safer than indoor shows. They also provide much better value. “Fans can see so many more acts at a festival for the same price they would pay to attend a big headline tour,” says Bobby Dee, who’s producing the Once Upon a Time in LA festival in December, which features Snoop Dogg, The Game and Al Green and sold out in less than 24 hours. “They are coming out the pandemic and making the decision that they don’t want to spend two hours watching one artist play their set and encore. They want the freedom to roam the event and curate their own experience.” {""nid"":""9649281"",""type"":""post"",""title"":""Neumos in Seattle, in a Pandemic: Ticket Sales Have 'Dropped Off a Cliff'"",""relative_path"":""\/articles\/business\/9649281\/neumos-seattle-pandemic-ticket-sales-no-show-rates\/"",""media"":{""width"":1548,""height"":1024,""extension"":""jpg"",""mime_type"":""image\/jpeg"",""type"":""image"",""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2020\/04\/Steven-Severin-in-a-pandemic-2020-billboard-1548-1587584028-compressed.jpg"",""sizes"":[{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2020\/04\/Steven-Severin-in-a-pandemic-2020-billboard-1548-1587584028-compressed.jpg"",""width"":1548,""height"":1024},{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2020\/04\/Steven-Severin-in-a-pandemic-2020-billboard-1548-1587584028-compressed.jpg"",""width"":1548,""height"":1024}],""orientation"":""landscape"",""id"":""9363693"",""caption"":null,""credit"":null}} With this in mind, artists are rethinking their touring plans for next year and beyond. In most cases, traditional headline concerts pay artists a guaranteed minimum, after which ticket revenue is split with the promoter, which means both sides share risk. Festivals instead offer acts a flat payment, regardless of subsequent ticket sales. That’s appealing to booking agents, who are worried about exposing their clients to risks as the concert business re-opens. It also gives some festivals the chance to book once-in-a-lifetime headliners like Stevie Nicks, who was booked to perform at BottleRock. It can also mean paying huge fees to book headline talent that might not bring in the kind of ticket sales organizers hoped for. In the case of BottleRock, weeks before the event, Nicks announced she couldn’t perform because of “rising COVID cases,” which left organizers to find a replacement big enough to placate customers and hopefully prevent refund requests that would put the festival in financial jeopardy. They secured Chris Stapleton, but he too pulled out the night before he was supposed to take the stage, blaming an unspecified illness. Brandi Carlile, who was already on the lineup, ended up filing in by flying in members of The Highwomen and singer Yola for a special set of their songs and covers. After all that, organizers say refund requests were minimal, speaking to the importance of the festival experience beyond headlining acts. But it shows how festivals may now need multiple backup plans. {""nid"":""9649430"",""type"":""post"",""title"":""How U.K. Touring Is Struggling to Keep On Truckin'"",""relative_path"":""\/articles\/business\/touring\/9649430\/uk-touring-struggling-post-brexit-rules\/"",""media"":{""width"":1548,""height"":1024,""extension"":""jpg"",""mime_type"":""image\/jpeg"",""type"":""image"",""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/10\/Market-global-bb15-2021-billboard-1548-1634755312-compressed.jpg"",""sizes"":[{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/10\/Market-global-bb15-2021-billboard-1548-1634755312-compressed.jpg"",""width"":1548,""height"":1024},{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/10\/Market-global-bb15-2021-billboard-1548-1634755312-compressed.jpg"",""width"":1548,""height"":1024}],""orientation"":""landscape"",""id"":""9648240"",""caption"":null,""credit"":null}} “If festivals continue to dominate in 2021, the major management companies might need to think about creating an on-call network of alternate acts that can step in at the last minute to high profile slots if something goes wrong,” said one agency source at the event. “We’ve got to prepare for a music business that’s going to require more flexibility and contingencies.”   {""account_id"":""1125911414"",""id"":""izFpZKac"",""title"":"""",""featured_media"":""""}",2021-10-25 20:12:30,,https://static.billboard.com/files/2021/10/guns-n-roses-bb15-touring-market-billboard-1548-1634754994-150x150.jpg,billboard

Billionaires taking action on climate change are part of a long tradition,https://theconversation.com/billionaires-taking-action-on-climate-change-are-part-of-a-long-tradition-170463,,"['David Tuffley', ' Senior Lecturer in Applied Ethics & CyberSecurity', ' Griffith University']",,,"If governments won’t act quickly enough on climate change, who will? Enter the new breed of (mostly young) billionaire philanthropists. Their goal is to use their influence and money to push the boundaries of science and technology for society’s benefit. One example is Mike Cannon-Brookes, billionaire co-founder of software developer Atlassian and his partner Annie Cannon-Brooke who this month pledged A$1.5 billion to invest in climate projects by 2030. $1 billion will be in financial investments and $500 million in philanthropic and advocacy work, with the aim of keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees. He wants other executives to follow suit. In the US the world’s largest funds manager Blackrock has injected funds into billionaire Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy, which is using philanthropic money to accelerate investments in new technologies. Breakthrough has reportedly secured US$1 billion in investments from Microsoft, General Motors, American Airlines, Boston Consulting Group, Bank of America and ArcelorMittal. In India, in Denmark, in Australia In India, its richest citizen Mukesh Ambani has pledged to take his energy giant net-zero by 2035, an undertaking he will fulfil by switching to renewable sources and converting carbon dioxide emissions into useful products and chemicals. Australia’s Andrew Forrest has established Fortescue Future Industries as part of Fortescue Metals with a mandate to invest billions in Green Hydrogen projects in Queensland and NSW and to take the mining group carbon-neutral by 2040. Read more: The AFR's 2021 Rich List shows we're not all in this together Elsewhere a Danish sceptic on carbon pricing Bjørn Lomborg has made a case for innovation in energy research in energy research as the way to limit carbon emissions, citing a parallel from the 1860’s when whales were hunted to near extinction for oil that was used to light homes. He says the solution was not to tax whales, it was the invention of kerosene that undercut the cost of whale oil. What’s happening isn’t new In 1919 businessman Raymond Orteig offered US$25,000 for the first person to fly non-stop from New York to Paris. The prize was won by an unknown 25-year-old US Army Reserve officer, Charles Lindberg, spurring enormous advances in aviation. Le Journals’ coverage of Charles A. Lindbergh’s 33 hour flight from New York to Pariswhich won him US$25,000 in prize money. Today, the X Prize Foundation and the Musk Foundation are offering a US$100 million X Prize for Carbon Removal funded by billionaire Elon Musk. The prize will go to the team from anywhere on the planet who can invent a machine that extracts carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or oceans at gigatonne-scale. Previous X Prizes have been awarded for the application of artificial intelligence to global issues, turning carbon dioxide into useful products, developing cheaper methods of mass testing for COVID, and creating water from thin air. Horses for courses There is a sound argument that important pledges and projects should be the responsibility of governments rather than individuals. Billionaires often get where they are by acting on self-interest, so it isn’t reasonable to expect them to act in the interest of the entire public. Read more: Bill and Melinda Gates: philanthropy caught in the crosshairs of society's obsession with celebrity On the other hand, some problems are too important and time sensitive to leave in the hands of governments that can’t act with agility. If an individual loses their money, it’s their loss. If the government loses the money, its the taxpayer’s loss. So governments have to be cautious. It’s probably not a matter of one or the other. Governments shouldn’t abandon their responsibility to act in the public interest. On the other hand, wealthy philanthropists throughout history have been prepared to help.

Is there a right time to move in with your partner?,https://metro.co.uk/2021/10/25/is-there-a-right-time-to-move-in-with-your-partner-15400844/,"['Sex', 'Dating', 'Relationships']",['Michele Theil'],,It might be better to consider if it's the 'wrong time'.,"Are you really ready to move in with your partner? (Picture: Getty Images) Moving in with a partner can be a big step in your relationship, and no matter how in love you are, you could be having doubts about whether it’s the right time. It might be a cliché, but for many people, moving in together is a test-run for the future – with any small squabbles kept in mind as an indicator of a relationship’s potential. As anyone moving in together will know, you also have to ensure your living habits are in sync – are you the type of person to leave your dishes for days on end, or do you clean them immediately? Do you like your home to be cool or cosy? Are you an early-riser or a night-owl? It can be very difficult to know for sure whether it’s the right time, but there are some things you should consider before making a decision. Callisto Adams, a dating and relationships expert, explains that while there is no ‘right time’ to move with a partner, there is definitely a wrong time: ‘If you have no clue of what you’re getting yourself into, then it is too soon.’ ‘If you don’t know what they’re like when they’re sad, mad, angry, happy, joyful, whether they’re a messy person or a super tidy one, if they’re an early bird or a night owl, and most importantly if you’re not emotionally connected to them, it is definitely too soon,’ she tells Metro.co.uk. To know you’re ready to move in with someone, Adams says you should ‘feel excitement’ when you think of ‘sharing a space with your partner’. ‘If it feels forced, and the fear is just too much to bear, then you’re not ready,’ she adds. Emma (24) is just about to move in with partner after a year together and she can’t wait to move in with him. She says: ‘It’s definitely the right decision for us because we’ve lived over an hour away from each other for the past year, and making time to see each other while dealing with work, friends, and other commitments can be hard. ‘This way, we know we’ll see each other every night and have quality time with each other.’ Alice and her partner are very excited to move in together, and after a year together, they don’t feel rushed to it at all. In fact, Alice says they wanted to move in together after just four months but due to leases, finding a suitable home, and the impact of Covid, they were forced to wait. Natasha (22) will be moving with her partner in just a few weeks too, but they have been together for just under six months. Though some people may think that’s soon, Natasha feels that both practically and emotionally, it is the right move for them. ‘My lease is up and if we weren’t moving in together, I would probably have to move further away from where I am now, which would severely impact our relationship. Due to our work schedules, it’s hard enough finding time together, so moving in together is the best thing for us both,’ Natasha explained. We put the question out on Twitter to ask for stories about their timelines for moving in with partners. One person said, ‘I moved in with my boyfriend after five months of going out. It didn’t feel too soon because we felt comfortable with each other already but I guess it depends on the couple.’ Another said, ‘We moved in together at around six months and got engaged three months later. We’re still married nearly ten years later.’ A third wrote, ‘We moved in together after a year and now we’re just about to celebrate our 8th wedding anniversary.’ A fourth said, ‘We moved in together after about five weeks and we’re still together almost three years later – it was just right for us!’ Couples move in together at their own pace (Picture: Getty) Others took longer, with one person writing that they moved in with their husband after 10 years together but that was because they didn’t want to ‘waste money on rent’. A few others moved in together after around one and a half years together and felt that it was the ‘right time’ for them. One person moved in with their ex after a year together and then broke up after a year living together, saying that it was ‘too soon’ for them. Everyone has different experiences, meaning the timing has to feel ‘right’ for you and your partner above all else. Adams emphasises that couples should be discussing their living habits in great detail, and whether you’re ‘willing to handle hair on the sink or clothes on the ground, or whatever ‘not the best’ habit they have communicated to you.’ More: DatingWhat each star sign is like as an ex and how they deal with breakupsWhat is the Strictly Come Dancing curse and are there any romances on the 2021 show?How do couples choose the right 'third' for a threesome?

At the end of the day, it is hard to know when the ‘right’ time is to move in with someone and Adams says ‘there is no specific milestone when it comes to the right time to move in with a partner’.

Blak...,"NEW YORK (AP) — Andrew Mangiapane scored twice and the Calgary Flames beat the New York Rangers 5-1 on Monday night for their third straight win. Blake Coleman and Mikael Backlund each had a goal and an assist, and Christopher Tanev also scored for Calgary. Johnny Gaudreau got his seventh assist of the season and Jacob Markstrom stopped 28 shots. Dryden Hunt scored for the Rangers, who had won four straight — all on the road. Igor Shesterkin, making his fifth start, finished with 32 saves. Trailing 2-0 after 40 minutes, the Rangers got on the scoreboard early in the third period. Markstrom stopped the initial shot by Jacob Trouba, but Hunt corralled a rebound in front and put it past the goalie for his first of the season at 5:25. Coleman restored Calgary’s two-goal lead less than three minutes later as he backhanded the rebound of his own shot past Shesterkin for his second. Backlund made it 4-1 with 8 1/2 minutes left as he scored into the top left corner from the right circle for his first. Mangiapane got his second of the night, scoring on a rebound on the power play from the right side with just over five seconds remaining. It was his fifth of the season and 10th in his last nine games, dating to last season. Leading 1-0 after one period, the Flames doubled their lead early in the second. Mangiapane intercepted a pass by Patrik Nemeth from behind the Rangers net and beat Shesterkin from the right side at 2:09. Mika Zibanejad had a chance to get the Rangers on the scoreboard after a Flames turnover as he skated up the ice with Alexis Lafreniere, but was denied by Markstorm with about 6 1/2 minutes left in the middle period. Shesterkin made a nice glove stop on a slap shot by Tyler Pitlick about 40 seconds later. Markstrom stopped a wraparound try by Trouba with just more than two minutes to go, and then denied his backhand follow. Calgary outshot New York 15-7 in the first period. Shesterkin’s best save of the period came on an attempt by Sean Monahan in front with 3:15 remaining after a giveaway by the goalie. Tanev got the Flames on the scoreboard on a rush with 1:10 left in the opening period as he got a pass from Gaudreau and beat Shesterkin from the right circle on the glove side for his first of the season. Elias Lindholm got his first assist and seventh point on the play. The Rangers were down two players for much of the first. Rugged forward Ryan Reaves went to the dressing room early in the period after an apparent injury to his left leg, and defenseman Ryan Lindgren joined him by the midpoint after blocking a shot with his foot. Lindgren was back on the bench late in the period, and returned to the ice in the second. Reaves was also on the bench at the start of the second, but did not play again. SPECIAL TEAMS The Rangers went 0 for 2 on the power play and are 3 for 26 this season. … The Flames were 1 for 2 with the man advantage, improving to 3 for 14. LINEUPS Ryan Strome returned to the Rangers’ lineup after missing the four-game road trip due to COVID-19 protocols. He started on a line with Artemi Panarin and Barclay Goodrow. Morgan Barron was sent to Hartford of the AHL to make room for Strome. Injured forward Kappo Kakko is still out and coach Gerard Gallant said Kakko could return Friday. Julian Gauthier was also back in the lineup, and Greg McKegg was scratched. With the exception of Markstrom, the Flames used the same lineup as Saturday against Washington.

"Vic has 1510 COVID-19 cases, four deaths",https://www.newcastleherald.com.au/story/7484010/vic-has-1510-covid-19-cases-four-deaths/?src=rss,,['Benita Kolovos'],,,,2021-10-25 22:12:14,"Victoria has recorded 1510 new COVID-19 cases and four deaths as new pandemic laws are set to be introduced to the state's parliament. The health department confirmed on Tuesday the state is managing 24,715 active cases. There are 817 people in hospital, 15 more than the previous day, with the seven-day average at 789. Of those, 147 are in intensive care and 88 on a ventilator. The latest deaths take the toll from the current outbreak to 234. There were 55,679 tests processed and 28,232 COVID-19 vaccine doses administered at state-run hubs on Monday. About 75 per cent of Victorians aged 16 and over are now fully vaccinated. The latest figures come as the state government is set to introduce new laws to parliament that would allow the health minister to make public health orders for the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the changes, Victoria's premier will have the power to ""declare"" a pandemic and extend it in three-month blocks for as long as considered necessary. The Public Health and Wellbeing (Pandemic Management) Bill 2021 will be introduced to the lower house as parliament resumes on Tuesday, several MPs have confirmed to AAP. Under the laws, the health minister will be provided ""broad powers to make pandemic orders"" on the chief health officer's advice, bringing Victoria in line with NSW and New Zealand where the health minister is directly accountable to parliament. An independent oversight committee will review public orders and their impact on human rights, while public health advice will need to be made public. The laws also introduce safeguards around protecting contact tracing and QR code information, while an aggravated offence will be created to ""deter ... the most egregious pandemic-related behaviours"". Court-imposed penalties will be introduced to stop businesses receiving commercial benefit after breaching a pandemic order. The bill aims to improve transparency in pandemic decision-making, with decision-makers to be accountable to parliament and the community, its summary said. It will replace the current state of emergency, which expires on December 15. The government has consulted with community groups, health and human rights experts and legal stakeholders on the proposed laws, and the bill is expected to pass the lower house but in the upper house it will require the backing of three of the 11 crossbenchers. Victoria's opposition said the new powers would give the premier ""more power with less accountability"", as it proposed the constitution be amended to require parliamentary approval for emergency or pandemic declarations. Tuesday's sitting is also the first since a vaccine mandate came into effect banning MPs from parliament if they refuse to provide proof of their vaccination status.

Six popular beliefs about colds: Experts explain the facts,https://metro.co.uk/2021/10/25/six-popular-beliefs-about-colds-experts-explain-the-facts-15464894/,"['Tech', 'Health', 'Metro newspaper']",['The Conversation'],,"No, garlic won't cure your cold.","No, garlic won’t cure your cold (Picture: Getty Images/iStockphoto) As we return to pre-lockdown levels of social mixing, colds are starting to become all too common. A TikTok video has gone viral involving putting garlic up your nose as a cold cure, just one in a long line of claimed treatments or cures. We asked two experts to examine some commonly held beliefs around colds. 1. Can you get a cold by getting cold? Colds become more common in winter. Like other upper respiratory tract infections (in the nose, throat and windpipe) they are normally caused by a virus. There might be a little truth in the idea that getting cold can give you a cold, because as the temperature changes this can alter the lining of our throat and windpipe, which can possibly make it easier for viruses to infect cells. However, the main reason we get more colds in winter is spending more time inside, closer to other people – the perfect environment to transmit viruses. 2. Does sticking garlic up your nose help? The TikTok trend involves putting cloves of garlic up your nose because it claims to act as a decongestant. Sticking something up your nose blocks the flow of mucus, so when it is removed, the flow starts and the mucus drips or even runs out of your nose. Mucus not only helps trap and remove pathogens including viruses, but also contains antibodies and can reduce how infectious and spreadable viruses are. So this is not a good idea. Garlic contains a range of compounds which might irritate the nose, and remember sticking anything up your nose isn’t a great idea. It could damage the lining and lead to bleeding or even get stuck. So it doesn’t really help and could be harmful. A TikTok trend suggested putting peeled cloves of garlic up your nose (Picture: Getty Images/Tetra images RF) 3. Can herbal remedies prevent colds? Various herbal remedies claim to either prevent or speed up recovery from a cold. People often mention echinacea, a family of plants that grow in North America. Some trials have suggested a small preventative effect, but the evidence does not show statistically significant reductions in illness levels. Turmeric is also touted as a preventative medicine, but there is no robust evidence for its effectiveness either. 4. Can vitamin C help? Nobel prize-winning scientist Linus Pauling suggested that vitamin C in high doses could be an effective treatment for many viral infections. But a Cochrane review, a very robust system in which researchers assess evidence, found that vitamin C did not prevent colds, but may reduce their duration, in some people. As vitamin C supplements of around 200mg per day are considered low risk, some suggest this is a reasonable strategy to shorten the effects of a cold. Vitamin C supplements might help shorten the duration of a cold (Picture: Getty Images) 5. Does vitamin D prevent colds? Vitamin D has moved from being the sunshine vitamin associated with healthy bones, to being linked to reducing the risks around everything from heart disease and diabetes to viruses. This has included a lot of interest in vitamin D as a way of helping us fight off flu and more recently Covid-19. Laboratory experiments show that vitamin D is important in supporting immunity and this is critical in fighting off viruses. The problem may be that some people have inadequate vitamin D levels. Sunshine allows us to make our own vitamin D — but that happens less in winter. So it is likely that taking vitamin D supplements as advised by the UK government over winter is sensible so that you get enough, and this may help prevent you from getting a cold. 6. What about chicken soup? Chicken soup has been used through the ages to treat colds, and like honey it might have some benefits in managing symptoms. But it is unlikely to make a big impact on driving out the infection. The water in the soup will help with hydration, which is a often a problem when we have a cold. Like most hot drinks it can help to relieve painful sinuses. There are studies looking at the effect on our immune system cells, but the evidence from these is far from conclusive. Sadly, there are no miracle cures for the common cold. Some suggestions may be helpful, and are generally not harmful, such as getting enough vitamin C and D. But others are definitely not worth trying and could be risky, such as putting garlic up your nose. The best thing to do is get plenty of rest and drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated.

Marie and area, were contracted via close contact and two were related to international travel, Algoma Public Health said. This brings the total number of confirmed cases to 509 since March 2020. Twenty-eight cases were active as of early Monday evening. There are currently no COVID-19 hospitalizations. There have been eight deaths in Algoma District, the most recent reported last Tuesday. Eleven new COVID-19 cases were reported Saturday and four more Sunday, all from Sault Ste. Marie and area. Fourteen became ill from close contact. It’s not known how one person became ill, APH said. All are self-isolating. Ten people were tested Friday. One person was tested Saturday. Meanwhile, additional individuals associated with River View Public School have tested positive for COVID-19. Algoma District School Board says there’s six confirmed cases. ADSB said late last Thursday that Algoma Public Health had declared an outbreak at the Wireless Avenue school. The health unit is identifying close contacts, a release says. Any low-and high-risk contacts will be contacted by letter by the health unit. Also, APH reported Saturday an individual associated with the YMCA before and after school program, McNabb site, tested positive for COVID-19. APH says if families from the program do not receive a low risk and/or high risk contact letter, their child is not considered a close contact of the person who tested positive, in which case APH does not recommend having their child tested unless he or she is showing symptoms. Algoma Public Health says it is is working with that specific Y program and child-are centre to review and confirm “important practices” to reduce the potential spread of COVID-19. Ontario is reporting Monday 326 new COVID-19 cases and no new deaths from the virus. Health Minister Christine Elliott says 231 cases are in people who are not fully vaccinated or have unknown vaccination status. She says 95 cases are in fully vaccinated people. There are 138 people in intensive care with COVID-related critical illness, including 94 people on ventilators. However, the province says the number of hospitalized patients may be higher because some hospitals did not provide data over the weekend. The province says 87 per cent of residents aged 12 and older have at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose and 83 per cent have received both shots.

Eight things we learned from the Facebook Papers,https://www.theverge.com/22740969/facebook-files-papers-frances-haugen-whistleblower-civic-integrity,,['Russell Brandom'],,,"A massive new document release shows chaos and confusion inside the world’s most powerful social network For months, Facebook has been shaken by a steady leak of documents from whistleblower Frances Haugen, beginning in The Wall Street Journal but spreading to government officials and nearly any outlet with an interest in the company. Now, those documents are going much more public, giving us the most sweeping look at the operations of Facebook anyone not directly involved with the company has ever had. The documents stem from disclosures made to the SEC and provided to Congress by Haugen in redacted form. The Verge and a consortium of other news organizations have obtained redacted versions of the documents, which we’re calling The Facebook Papers. In order to receive the documents, we agreed to begin publishing our reporting on them this week, but we are not beholden to report on them in a certain way or coordinate what we cover with other outlets. We’ve already done some reporting on the files, and we’ll keep reporting on them over the coming weeks. (There are a lot of pages.) This isn’t a comprehensive list of everything in the documents, and you should fully expect more to come out. Instead, think of it as a summary of the files that, so far, have stood out to us the most. Hopefully, it will help you make sense of the sheer volume of Facebook news coming out this morning. Facebook was caught off guard by vaccine misinformation in comments Facebook has taken a lot of criticism for its handling of COVID misinformation — including from President Biden, who accused the platform of “killing people” by letting anti-vaxx sentiment run amok — but the leaks show just how chaotic the effort was inside the company. One document dated March 2021 shows an employee raising the alarm about how unprepared the platform was. “Vaccine hesitancy in comments is rampant,” the memo reads. “Our ability to detect vaccine-hesitant comments is bad in English, and basically non-existent elsewhere. We need Policy guidelines specifically aimed at vaccine hesitancy in comments.” (Editor’s note: We are not publishing the document itself since it contains the full name of a Facebook employee.) “Comments are a significant portion of misinfo on FB,” says another employee in an internal comment, “and are almost a complete blind spot for us in terms of enforcement and transparency right now.” “For English posts on Vaccines, vaccine hesitancy prevalence among comments is 50 percent.” The document makes clear that Facebook already had a “COVID-19 lockdown defense” project dedicated to the platform dynamics created by the pandemic, including a workstream dedicated entirely to vaccine hesitancy. That team had also created significant automated flagging systems for misinformation — but according to the files, those simply weren’t being used to downrank anti-vaccine comments. As of the March memo, there were no plans to develop moderation infrastructure like labeling, guidelines, and classifier systems to identify anti-vaccine statements in comments. The failure to meaningfully moderate comments was noticed outside the company. A First Draft News study in May looked at the comments for a handful of major news outlets with more than a million followers and found one in five comments on vaccine-related stories contained some kind of anti-vaccine misinformation. The documents show Facebook was aware of the problem, and First Draft may have even underestimated the issue. One comment on the post reads, “for English posts on Vaccines, vaccine hesitancy prevalence among comments is 50 percent.” Other aspects of the issue remained completely unstudied since the company had yet to dig in on the comment problem. “We currently don’t understand whether Group comments are a serious problem,” the post argues. “It’s clear to us that the ‘good post, bad comment’ problem is a big deal, but it’s not necessarily as clear that [vaccine hesitant] comments on [vaccine hesitant] posts are additive to the harm.” Another document published shortly after April 2021 shows the company still coming to terms with vaccine misinformation. The good news was that there was no evidence of a foreign influence campaign driving anti-vaxx sentiment, as had stung the company in 2016. But the vast majority of content was being sent by a relatively small portion of accounts, suggesting that Facebook had not yet taken the easiest measures to address the issue. Facebook has taken some steps recently to address misinformation in comments — including new downranking rules from just last week. But these documents show those changes came more than six months after the alarm had been raised internally and after Facebook had publicly expressed anxiety about the impending leak. Given the huge surge of COVID deaths among vaccine-skeptical populations over the past three months, it’s easy to see the recent changes as too little, too late. Apple threatened to ban Facebook over online “slave markets” Facebook scrambled to address human trafficking content after Apple threatened to kick its apps off the iOS App Store, a leaked SEV (or Site Event) report shows. The report, referenced briefly by The Wall Street Journal’s Facebook Files reporting, indicates that Apple threatened to pull Facebook and Instagram from iOS on October 23rd of 2019. Apple had been tipped off by a BBC News Arabic report that found domestic workers being sold via Instagram and other apps, where sellers encouraged buyers to mistreat the workers by doing things such as confiscating their passports. the policy was “highly likely leading to exploitation of domestic servants” Facebook had been aware of the problem but hadn’t understood the scope of it, apparently because very little content (less than 2 percent of the material it found) had been reported by users. “Removing our applications from Apple platforms would have had potentially severe consequences to the business,” the Facebook report notes. After Apple escalated the issue, Facebook moderators swept the platforms for keywords and hashtags mentioned in the BBC reporting, ultimately disabling 1,021 accounts and removing 129,121 pieces of content. Facebook also removed a policy exception letting established brick and mortar businesses like recruitment agencies post ads about domestic workers. Facebook determined that even if the businesses were legal, the policy was “highly likely leading to exploitation of domestic servants.” Apple was apparently satisfied with the mitigation measures, and the incident was closed within a week. The Civic Integrity team was often directly blocked by Zuckerberg One of the most alarming incidents uncovered by the papers was that Mark Zuckerberg personally intervened to ensure Facebook would comply with a repressive law instituted in Vietnam, agreeing to moderate more aggressively against “anti-state” content on the platform. The anecdote leads The Washington Post’s report on the papers and plays into a much more troubling dynamic described by Haugen before Congress. Facebook’s Integrity team had lots of ideas for how to make Facebook less harmful, but they were usually overruled, sometimes by Zuckerberg himself. Bloomberg News explores the issue in more detail, showing how the company often found its own efforts to downrank harmful content overwhelmed by the content’s inherent virality. As one employee put it, “I worry that Feed is becoming an arms race.” Politico highlights another employee quote showing just how demoralized the team had become. “If we really want to change the state of our information ecosystem, we need a revolution, not an evolution of our systems,” an employee wrote in October 2019. “If you don’t have enough good content to boost, it doesn’t matter how much you downrank the bad.” Facebook used a German anti-vaccine movement as a test case for more aggressive moderation Another document details Facebook’s so-called “Querdenken experiment,” in which the company’s moderators tested out a more aggressive moderation approach on a German conspiracy movement. Facebook’s Dangerous Content team was already developing a new classification — a “harmful topic community” — and the growing Querdenken was chosen as an experiment on how the classification would work in practice. As a Facebook employee writes in the document, “this could be a good case study to inform how we tackle these problems in the future” “this could be a good case study to inform how we tackle these problems in the future” Querdenken has become one of the leading anti-lockdown and anti-vaccination groups in Germany, with similarities to more extreme groups like QAnon. As the Facebook proposal framed it, the Querdenken movement had potential for violence but wasn’t yet linked to extreme enough activity that would justify banning followers from the platform entirely. The documents give few details about how the experiment proceeded, although clearly, some version of the Querdenken plan was implemented. (A later report says “results from some initial samples look promising.”) And judging by the company’s public statements, it did result in a meaningful change to moderation policy: in September, Facebook announced a new policy on “coordinated social harm,” specifically citing Querdenken as an example of the new approach in action. Unlike many of the other documents, the Querdenken experiment shows Facebook’s moderation system as relatively effective. The company identified the group before it caused significant harm, took action with an eye towards long-term consequences and was transparent about the policy shift after it took place. But the incident shows how complex the interplay of policy and enforcement can be, with broader policies often rewritten with an eye towards specific groups. And for supporters of Querdenken, it may be alarming to learn that the rules of the world’s largest social platform were rewritten specifically to keep their movement from gaining public support. Facebook’s January 6th response was shaped by glitches and delays Facebook discussed developing extreme “break-glass measures” to limit misinformation, calls to violence, and other material that could disrupt the 2020 presidential election. But when former President Donald Trump and his supporters tried to stop successor Joe Biden from being declared president on January 6th, 2021, Facebook employees complained these measures were implemented too late or stymied by technical and bureaucratic hangups. Reports at Politico and The New York Times outline Facebook’s struggle to handle users delegitimizing the elections. Internally, critics said Facebook didn’t have a sufficient game plan for “harmful non-violating narratives” that toed the line between misinformation and content Facebook wants to preserve as free speech. And some plans, like a change that would have prevented Groups from changing their names to terms like “Stop the Steal,” apparently got held up by technical problems. Facebook was trying to rebalance its News Feed for “civic health” The Wall Street Journal first revealed that news outlets and political parties had complained about users favoring negative and hyperbolic content. Facebook was considering ways to fix the problem, and one method involved re-weighting the News Feed to optimize for “civic health” instead of primarily focusing on meaningful social interactions or session time. In a product briefing called “Ranking For Civic Health,” Facebook acknowledged that “people think that political content on Facebook is low quality, untrustworthy, and divisive,” and the current ranking system was “not creating a wholly valuable civic experience for users.” (Based on document comment dates, the document was produced around January and February of 2020.) “people think that political content on Facebook is low quality, untrustworthy, and divisive” The document says Facebook’s ranking algorithm recommended civic content that users themselves didn’t report finding valuable — something earlier leaks have indicated was a problem with meaningful social interactions (MSI) and other engagement-based metrics. “Our current ranking objectives do not optimize for integrity outcomes, which can have dangerous consequences,” it says — for instance, MSI optimization was “contributing hugely to Civic misinfo,” and Facebook estimated that removing it from Civic posts would decrease it by 30 to 50 percent. Facebook tried to improve civic health by asking users explicitly what they thought constituted good civic content. This sometimes revealed even bigger problems — since Facebook apparently found that 20 to 30 percent of respondents “may say that known Civic hate is ‘good for the community’” in surveys. Facebook settled on a strategy to “prioritize the reduction of policy-violating content — such as Civic Hate or Civic Misinfo — even if the individual user finds it valuable” and aimed to reduce the prevalence of civic hate speech, misinformation, and inflammatory content by at least 10 percent. The company ran rebalancing experiments in February 2020 by slightly increasing the amount of “civic” News Feed content that a random set of users saw, then optimizing that content through different metrics (including MSI and whether people thought content was “worth your time”). It also ran a survey to collect how users felt about civic News Feed content. The company aimed to have a new optimization system chosen by March of 2020 — although it’s not clear how the coronavirus pandemic may have changed those plans. Why likes were never hidden on Facebook and Instagram A highly publicized plan from early last year to hide like counts on Instagram never happened because testing the change hurt ad revenue and led to people using the app less. A quiet test of the experience on the Facebook app was also killed after leadership told Zuckerberg that it wasn’t a “top barrier to sharing nor a top concern for people.” A lengthy internal presentation to Zuckerberg about the plan, dubbed Project Daisy, shows that there were concerns among leadership about how the Facebook app would have been perceived if Instagram hid like counts and Facebook did not, which is something employees who were involved in the project have told The Verge. Employees working on Instagram wanted to bill it as a way to depressurize the app for young people, but the team working on the Facebook app wasn’t into the idea. If Instagram went through with hiding likes, the presentation details how leadership at Facebook wanted to “minimize blowback to the Facebook app” for not hiding them and still “ensure credit ladders up to the Facebook company.” Instead of hiding likes for all users by default as was originally planned, Instagram earlier adopted a half measure by letting people opt into hiding their likes. Facebook’s “civic groups” policy stumbled over a simple design flaw In October 2020, Facebook announced that it would stop recommending civic and political groups to users in the US as part of a broader effort to avoid the mistakes of the 2016 election. (The policy was made permanent shortly after the January 6th riot.) But actually keeping those groups out of Facebook recommendation feeds has been a huge challenge for the company — and an internal document gives us new insight into why. The document shows Facebook employees grappling with a public article, flagged by the PR team, which found 30 separate groups still appearing in recommendation feeds in apparent violation of the policy. Escalated on January 19th, the document says many of the groups named in the report had been labeled as civic groups at one point — but were somehow still being recommended as part of facebook’s Groups You Should Join feature. Reducing churn could have solved almost all of the problems “Leakage has been there since Nov 2020 at the least,” the Facebook document reads. It’s not clear which article the document is referring to, but there were a number of reports spotting enforcement failures at the time. The Markup found a bunch of groups slipping through that January and again in June. Even now, it’s not clear the civic groups policy is being enforced as intended. At the time, most observers focused on the conceptual difficulty: it’s a hard philosophical problem to draw a clear line between which groups count as “civic” and even harder to scale it across a platform of Facebook’s size. But the internal report shows the real problem was much simpler. Facebook’s monitoring system (referred to in the report as “Laser”) had been trained to only look at the past seven days of content when determining whether a page fell into the “civic groups” category, which meant pages were constantly filtering in and out as the period viewed by the algorithm changed. In practice, that meant a pro-Trump or pro-Biden group could easily dodge the label by posting a few days worth of less obviously political content. The report estimates that a full 12 percent of labeled groups would churn out of the category from day to day. According to the report, 90 percent of the groups highlighted by the article had been caught by Facebook’s existing “civic groups” classifier — but they’d filtered out as part of the churn. So reducing churn alone could have solved almost all of the problems spotted by the report. There have been lots of stories like this over the past five years: Facebook sets a policy that seems measured and responsible, but a cursory test (usually from a journalist) shows banned content is still easily slipping through. From the outside, it’s often unclear how much of the problem is incompetence at Facebook and how much is just the inherent difficulty of managing a platform of that size. But in this case, the documents put the blame squarely on Facebook as a company. This was a high-profile policy with huge stakes for the country at large, with obvious delicacy in how it was implemented. A churn rate that high made it inevitable that targeted groups would slip through the cracks, and the company simply didn’t notice until reporters called them out.",2021-10-25 15:40:19,,,theverge
Quentin Tarantino’s Music Recommendation to Edgar Wright Inspired the ‘Last Night in Soho’ Movie Title,https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/quentin-tarantino-music-recommendation-edgar-wright-inspired-last-night-in-soho-movie-title.html/,"['movies', 'music', 'Quentin Tarantino']",['Jeff Nelson'],,'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' filmmaker Quentin Tarantino recommended a song to Edgar Wright. That one song ended up being the perfect title for 'Last Night in Soho.',"Edgar Wright is the beloved filmmaker behind big titles such as Shaun of the Dead and Baby Driver. His long-anticipated Last Night in Soho suffered from coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic-related delays. Wright’s fans are incredibly excited to finally experience his newest movie. Wright recently recalled in an interview that he came up with the Last Night in Soho thanks to a music recommendation from legendary filmmaker Quentin Tarantino. Quentin Tarantino has stories behind his soundtracks Quentin Tarantino | Elisabetta Villa/Getty Images for RFF Tarantino is known for having very distinctive music in his movies. He handpicks each and every song used in his movies. Many of them come from his own massive music collection. These songs build the setting and atmosphere for the given movie. He emphasizes the importance of selecting the right songs for his movies. For example, Dick Dale’s “Misirlou” in Pulp Fiction‘s opening credits starts the movie off with a bang. Meanwhile, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood features a collection of music from 1960s radio to perfectly establish the time period. Tarantino has a vast knowledge of film, but he’s also rather well-versed when it comes to music knowledge. One music recommendation gave Edgar Wright the ‘Last Night in Soho’ movie title Wright spoke about the process of coming up with a title for Last Night in Soho with Total Film. He expressed that he has always had a fascination with 1960s London, even though he never experienced it himself. Wright was trying to come up with a movie title for Last Night in Soho but was having some difficulty. His first ideas included Red Light Area and The Night Has a Thousand Eyes. However, they were a bit too close to other movie titles. The filmmaker said that the Last Night in Soho title came from a particular conversation with Tarantino. The initial conversation was regarding Tarantino’s movie Death Proof. They were talking about Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick, and Tich’s 1968 song “Hold Tight!” Tarantino personally recommended Wright to listen to their song “Last Night in Soho.” Wright said he then realized his movie title was “staring [him] in the face.” Tarantino called the song “the best title music for a film that’s never been made.” Wright ended up taking that challenge. Quentin Tarantino responds to the Edgar Wright using the ‘Last Night in Soho’ title Wright didn’t get the chance to talk to Tarantino about naming his movie Last Night in Soho. He was working on Once Upon a Time in Hollywood at the time, which kept him ridiculously busy. Wright later asked Tarantino if it was acceptable that he took the idea from him. Tarantino told him that the idea originated from filmmaker Allison Anders, but that “only [Wright] could make that movie.” So, there’s no bad blood here. Last Night in Soho is currently enjoying generally positive reviews from critics. The movie opens in theaters Oct. 29 for audiences to finally check out Wright’s latest movie.

That announcement came just over an hour after coach Matt LaFleur confirmed that Barry had tested positive. LaFleur said that Barry is fully vaccinated and therefore possibly could join the Packers (6-1) for Thursday night’s game if he tested negative Tuesday and Wednesday. “But I’m not going to hold my breath on that,” LaFleur said. LaFleur spoke to reporters before the announcement regarding Adams, who is tied for second in the NFL in catches (73) and is third in yards receiving (744). He did say there were “potentially some other issues with staff.” The reserve/COVID-19 list is for players who either test positive or have close contact with someone who’s infected. LaFleur said the Packers are in advanced protocols and conducted all of Monday’s coaches meetings virtually. LaFleur said all team personnel have to wear masks while in the building, whether or not they’re vaccinated. The Packers are working through which assistant will be responsible for calling defensive plays Thursday if Barry’s unavailable. One candidate could be defensive backs coach Jerry Gray, who has been a defensive coordinator with the Buffalo Bills (2001-05) and Tennessee Titans (2011-13). “I think regardless of how we do it, it’ll be a collective effort with everybody involved and having an input,” LaFleur said. “But certainly you feel confident with a guy like Jerry, who’s called it before and has had a top-five defense in this league. So we definitely have people that we feel are capable of getting the job done.”",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/davante-adams-packers-covid-status.jpg?quality=90&strip=all,nypost

More contagious offshoot of Delta coronavirus variant found in UK. What is it?,https://www.indiatoday.in/coronavirus-outbreak/story/delta-coronavirus-variant-ay-4-2-uk-india-symptoms-vaccine-1869060-2021-10-25?utm_source=rss,,,,More contagious offshoot of Delta Covid variant found in UK. What is it?,,2021-10-25 07:58:02,"In a reminder that the Covid-19 pandemic is not over yet, scientists are closely monitoring a new mutation of the Delta variant, named AY.4.2 . This comes amid a rise in cases in the United Kingdom (UK). AY.4.2 has also been found in India ""in very low numbers"", said scientists of INSACOG, a forum set up by the Union health ministry, a TOI report said. The new variant, which scientists say may be more transmissible than the Delta strain, has been declared as a ""Variant Under Investigation (VUI)"" (VUI-21OCT-01) in the UK. “The designation was made on the basis that this sub-lineage has become increasingly common in the UK in recent months, and there is some early evidence that it may have an increased growth rate in the UK compared to Delta,” the UK health security agency said. “More evidence is needed to know whether this is due to changes in the virus’ behaviour or to epidemiological conditions,” the UK health security agency said. According to the UK health security agency, about 6 per cent of Covid-19 cases that were genetically sequenced last week were of the AY.4.2 mutation. The Delta variant was behind the sharp rise in Covid-19 cases in the UK in spring, leading to enforcement of stringent lockdowns. Britain has recorded the highest number of new Covid-19 cases since July over the past week. Daily infections have been hovering over the 49,000 mark. What is AY.4.2? Since viruses mutate all the time, new versions are bound to emerge. The AY.4.2 mutation of the Delta variant was first noticed in July 2021 and since then it has been slowly increasing. Is AY.4.2 more transmissible? A report in the BBC says AY.4.2 contains mutations that might give the virus survival advantages. There has also been preliminary evidence that it spreads more quickly than the dominant Delta variant. AY.4.2 contains spike mutations Y145H and A222V that help the virus enter human cells more easily. Professor Francois Balloux, director of University College London's Genetics Institute, told the BBC that ""AY.4.2 is potentially a marginally more infectious strain"". How much more transmissible? ""It's nothing compared with what we saw with Alpha and Delta, which were something like 50 to 60 per cent more transmissible. So, we are talking about something quite subtle here and that is currently under investigation. It is likely to be up to 10 per cent more transmissible,"" Francois Balloux told the BBC. A few cases have also been identified in the US and infections with AY.4.2 are growing in Denmark and Israel.",,indiatoday

Christopher Lawrence ""Bong"" Go reassured that the government was working hard to accelerate the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines to halt the pandemic as his team conducted a relief effort for vulnerable residents of Makato and Numancia in Aklan on Monday, October 18. In a video message, Go explained that getting vaccinated substantially reduced one's risk of developing severe symptoms and being hospitalized. He reminded local authorities to follow the priority list to ensure the success of the national vaccination strategy. ""Habang patuloy tayong nagbabakuna, 'wag tayo maging kumpiyansa dahil delikado itong Covid-19. Target natin ma-achieve ang population protection this year at ang herd immunity by early next year para unti-unti na natin fully mabuksan ang ekonomiya. Iyan ang hiling namin palagi ni Pangulong Duterte (While we continue with our vaccinations, let us not be complacent because this Covid-19 is dangerous. We target to achieve the population protection this year and herd immunity by early next year in order that we could eventually fully open the economy. That is what President Duterte and I are always praying),"" the senator said. ""Ang importante, buhay tayo at malampasan natin ang pandemyang ito. Hindi ito kaya ng ating gobyerno kung hindi tayo magmalasakit at magbayanihan (What is important is that we are alive and that we overcome this pandemic. The government cannot accomplish these if we do not show compassion and community spirit),"" the senator added. Go's staff distributed meals, vitamins, face masks and face shields in batches to a total of 4,000 residents at the Aklan Sports Complex in the Makato and the Numancia covered courts. The staff gave select residents new shoes and bicycles for traveling as well as computer tablets for blended learning activities. Meanwhile, personnel from the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) provided each resident some financial assistance under its Assistance to Individuals in Crisis Situation program. The Department of Agriculture (DA) handed out separate financial assistance to farmers and fisherfolk under the Kadiwa ni Ani at Kita program. On the other hand, the Department of Trade and Industry and the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority conducted assessments of residents, who were seeking livelihood and skills training opportunities. The senator, who was the chairman of the Senate Committee on Health and Demography, also offered assistance to those who required treatment at the bigger hospitals in Metro Manila. He advised them to seek further aid from the government through the Malasakit Center, located at the Dr. Rafael S. Tumbokon Memorial Hospital in Kalibo, Aklan's capital. The Malasakit Center aimed to make medical assistance programs more accessible by putting together concerned agencies under one roof. These agencies were the DSWD, the Department of Health, the Philippine Health Insurance Corp. and the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office. The primary task of the Malasakit Center was to reduce a hospital bill to the lowest amount possible by covering various patient services and expenses, pursuant to the Malasakit Centers Act of 2019, which Go principally authored and sponsored in the Senate. The senator thanked Second District Rep. Teodorico Haresco Jr., Gov. Florencio Miraflores, Vice Gov. Reynaldo Quimpo, Makato Mayor Abencio Torres and Vice Mayor Ramon Legaspi 3rd, and Numancia Mayor Jeserel Templonuevo and Vice Mayor Rogelio Enero 2nd for working to help those hit hardest by the pandemic. As vice chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, Go has supported several initiatives to enhance accessibility and foster economic growth in Aklan. Among these initiatives were the construction of local roads in Makato and an evacuation center and a slaughterhouse in Numancia. Other major initiatives included the construction of roads in Balete; riverbank protection structures along the Tigayon-Kalibo and Minalezo sections of the Kalibo River; a multipurpose building for monitoring emerging and reemerging infectious diseases; a two-story building for the Ibajay District Hospital; multipurpose buildings in Balete and Buruanga; and the rehabilitation of the Altavas, Ibajay and Libacao public parks. Recently, Go's staff also provided relief to thousands of residents in Altavas, Balete, Banga, Batan, Kalibo, Lezo, Libaco, Madalag, Malinao and New Washington. The activities were carried out in batches to ensure the strict enforcement of health and safety protocols.",,2021-10-24 12:56:17,,https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2021/10/24/22370.jpg,manilatimes

The policy covering some 50,000 workers comes after similar measures for health-care and education employees and takes effect on Friday afternoon. Anyone who does not comply with the mandate will be placed on unpaid leave starting next Monday, November 1. As an additional incentive, the city has offered $500 to workers who decide to get vaccinated. Police and fire personnel joined sanitation workers, paramedics, teachers and a range of supporters in what was dubbed the “Anti-Mandate March For Choice.” It followed a smaller-scale demonstration on Sunday outside the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. NBA star Kyrie Irving, who plays for the Brooklyn Nets, has been sidelined by the team until he complies with the city’s vaccine requirement in a highly publicized case. Related Story CDC Approves Expansion Of Covid Vaccine Booster Rollout, L.A. To Begin Delivering Additional Shots Tomorrow As Covid vaccines have rolled out in recent months, federal, state and local officials have adopted a wide range of stances. Cities like New York, LA and San Francisco have enacted mandates covering indoor venues and municipal employees, while populous states like Florida and Texas have gone the other way. Debate over vaccines has continued despite a notable lack of scientific evidence indicating they cause harm in any statistically significant way. Last month, with the Delta variant surging in many states, President Joe Biden unveiled a sweeping set of mandates covering as many as 100 million private-sector employees as well as health care workers and federal contractors. New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio, who is in the waning weeks of his second term in office, was asked during his daily press briefing about the resistance to the mandate. Some firefighters and other workers have indicated they plan to show up for work on Monday without being vaccinated. “I appreciate always the people who do the work,” De Blasio said. “The vast, vast majority” of city residents have elected to get vaccinated, with 85% of all adults in the city having gotten at least one dose. Despite the fact that a “super-super majority of has decided this is the right thing to do,” the mayor added, “there’s still a lot of misinformation out there. Some people are being swayed by it. We’re going to be really clear and consistent” in enforcing the mandate, he said. Similar saber-rattling, as well as legal challenges, happened when education department workers, including teachers, were confronted with the mandate ahead of the start of school in September. Since those clashes, by the mayor’s count about 3,500 Dept. of Education employees have been vaccinated. “I think you’re going to see some of that” again, he said.",https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Vaccine-mandate-protest.jpg,deadline

The agency had initially hoped to launch the test flight by the end of this year, with astronauts set to walk on the Moon by 2024. Artist impression of Nasa’s Orion spacecraft It achieved a major milestone last Wednesday when it stacked the Orion crew capsule atop its Space Launch System megarocket. The huge spacecraft now stands 322 feet (98 meters) tall inside the Vehicle Assembly Building at NASA Kennedy Space Center in Florida. After further tests, it will be wheeled out to the launchpad for a “wet dress rehearsal” in January. That involves the full launch team following exact launch day procedures by testing and fuelling the rocket in a real-life countdown. The first window for the lunar launch opening is in February, officials told reporters on a call on Friday. “The February launch period opens on the 12th and our last opportunity in February is on the 27th,” said Mike Sarafin, Artemis 1 mission manager. The next windows are in March and April.

The mission duration is expected to be four to six weeks. NASA will also deploy small satellites, known as CubeSats, to perform experiments and technology demonstrations. Artemis 2 is then scheduled for 2023 and Artemis 3 for the following year, when humans will walk on the Moon for the first time since 1972. Both missions are now likely to be pushed back, however. NASA says the moonwalkers will include the first woman and first person of colour to make the trip. The space agency is seeking to establish a sustainable presence on the Moon as well as use the lessons it learns to plan a crewed trip to Mars in the 2030s. Orion first flew into space in 2014, launched by a Delta IV rocket, making two circumnavigations of Earth and testing its heat shield on re-entry into the atmosphere. But this time, NASA’s Sarafin said, the capsule will travel much faster and the temperature will be much higher when it returns from the Moon. Artemis 1 has several objectives: To demonstrate Orion’s ability to return from the Moon and operate in deep space where it is “much colder than in low Earth orbit,” and to successfully recover the spacecraft, he added. The mission also plans to study radiation and take selfies of the capsule with the Moon in the background.

Overhaul needed on ‘paper-based’ health sector records,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/overhaul-needed-on-paper-based-health-sector-records-1.4710145?localLinksEnabled=false,,,,"The State’s health service regulator has called for an urgent overhaul of how health information is managed, saying that it is central to the success of the Sláintecare reform plan. The Health Information and Quality Authority (Hiqa) has said there are “major deficiencies” in the collection, use and sharing of information with data on patient health usually being managed on different electronic systems or on paper-based systems, which can affect people’s safety. The watchdog has called for the establishment of the long-recommended eHealth Ireland digital systems to manage patient information, not just across the Health Service Executive but across the wider health and social-care sector. It also wants new legislation to allow patient information to be shared more easily and new guidance and codes of practice for healthcare professionals. Hiqa said that changes to how patient information is managed and shared and the legislation underpinning it was critical to the rollout of Sláintecare, the Government’s 10-year plan to overhaul the health service and integrate health and social care across State services. Laura Magahy, the executive director of Sláintecare, cited the slow progress in rolling out of the ehealth system as one of the reasons for her resignation from the role last month. Rachel Flynn, Hiqa’s director of health information and standards, said the urgent reform of the management of health information had to be made “a political priority” and that Hiqa’s concerns should be “a wake-up call” for everyone involved in health and social care. “Sláintecare is about integrated care. You cannot have integrated care relying on paper to communicate,” said Ms Flynn. “I have spoken to community health teams where they are delivering care in the community using a paper-based folder to share information. There are huge inefficiencies in that.” Cyberattack Ms Flynn said the experiences of the Covid-19 pandemic and the cyberattack on the HSE earlier this year showed the impact on people’s safety from having to rely on paper records and led to an increase in waiting lists and rescheduled appointments. “Covid highlighted the fact that a lot of our information systems are very, very basic,” she said. The pandemic showed that the State did not have a digital system covering vaccination programmes, while gaps in information systems highlighted how the State was unable to vaccinate particular groups, such as people with diabetes, because there was no national register. Health information systems in other countries allows them to prescribe medicines online but the Government had to pass emergency legislation for digital prescriptions during the pandemic. Ms Flynn said that Denmark has operated an online portal for patients where they could book appointments for Covid-19 test and look up test results and download their vaccination certs. “Denmark already had that infrastructure in place for all healthcare so they didn’t have to reinvent it for Covid-19, making their management of Covid-19 somewhat easier,” she said.",,2021-10-25 23:01:00,"The State’s health service regulator has called for an urgent overhaul of how health information is managed, saying that it is central to the success of the Sláintecare reform plan.

‘This is the path’: Pakula says road map unlikely to change regardless of COVID-19 case numbers,https://www.smh.com.au/national/victoria/victoria-records-1461-new-cases-as-further-easing-of-restrictions-announced-20211025-p592rp.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_feed,,['Simone Fox Koob'],,"The new road map back from restrictions outlined by the state government at the weekend will not be delayed even if there is a spike in coronavirus case numbers, according to Sports Minister Martin Pakula.",,2021-10-25 01:18:22,"The new road map back from restrictions outlined by the state government at the weekend will not be delayed even if there is a spike in coronavirus case numbers, according to Sports Minister Martin Pakula. On Monday as the state recorded 1461 new COVID-19 cases and a renewed push to vaccinate Indigenous Victorians was unveiled, Mr Pakula said it was unlikely the updated road map would change. Melburnians eat out again as the city reopens. Credit: Getty “There is no suggestion that this road map will be deviated from,” told 3AW radio on Monday. “I think the important thing to look at is not so much the case numbers, but the hospitalisation and ICU numbers and the truth of the matter is while the case numbers are tracking pretty close to the Burnet modelling, the numbers in hospital and the numbers in ICU are significantly lower than what was modelled and anticipated. “Those numbers are tracking below the model and I think the indication has been very clear, this is the path we are on now,” Mr Pakula said. A total of 802 people were in hospital with the COVID-19, of which 152 were in intensive care, 92 ventilated. It was an increase in the number of people in hospital with the virus in Victoria, taking the seven-day hospitalisation average to 792. On Monday, 91.4 per cent of Victorians aged 16 and over have had their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, and 74.7 per cent have had their second dose. Mr Pakula’s comments come after Victoria recorded 1461 new cases of coronavirus and seven deaths and as the state government unveiled a plan to drive up vaccination rates within Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. The Victorian government and Aboriginal community-controlled organisations will increase the number of mobile outreach vans across the state. “The fact that certainly up until now, our Indigenous communities have been amongst the most organised and the most proactive in taking our public health messages has been an outstanding success,” Health Minister Foley said. “The truth is we need to do more. “We need to make sure that particularly when it comes to communities that have lower vaccination levels, as we race towards a safer Victoria, that those communities are supported every step of the way.” “The truth is we need to do more.” The new push will see vaccination vans operated by the Victorian Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation deployed to Morwell this week, before they head to Seymour, Warrnambool, the Mornington Peninsula and the Grampians. Victorian Aboriginal Health Service chief executive Michael Graham said the vans will go directly to homes, parks and other community centres to try and reach people who are yet to receive their vaccination. “Whatever it takes, wherever it needs to go, it’ll go there,” he said. “Whatever it takes, wherever it needs to go, it’ll go there.” Mr Graham, a father of 10, said some people were still scared or hesitant to get the vaccine, and others, for example, people with a disability, have had access issues. There was also a reluctance among young people, he said. He said when you looked at the history of Australia and the number of viruses that have been introduced, it was understandable that there was some fear within the community. “There is always going to be fear of any virus that comes into this country I think. In saying that, we have done reasonably well, we have done better than I thought, and I think that’s due to the fact we’ve got Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations where they’re trusted, they’re culturally safe,” he said. “There is always going to be fear of any virus that comes into this country, I think. In saying that, we have done reasonably well, we have done better than I thought.” An additional surge workforce supported by the Royal Flying Doctor Service and Star Health will provide more support to regional areas such as Mildura, Gippsland, Shepparton as well as key areas in Melbourne. Close to 80 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Victorians over the age of 12 have had one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, compared to 90 per cent of the wider population. On Sunday, part of the third level of the Royal Children’s Hospital in Melbourne was listed as an exposure site after someone with coronavirus visited for more than an hour last week.

Credit: Chris Hopkins The Recovery Parent Waiting Room on the third level of the hospital, located on Flemington Road in Parkville, was listed as a Tier 1 exposure site. This means anyone who was there on October 18 between 1.51pm and 3.40pm must get tested immediately and quarantine for seven days since exposure if fully vaccinated, or 14 days if not fully vaccinated. The hospital was also listed as an exposure site less than two weeks ago , when dozens of sick and vulnerable babies were plunged into isolation with their parents after a father visited his sick child on the neonatal intensive care ward while unknowingly infectious with COVID-19. The hospital’s chief executive, Bernadette McDonald, said at the time the hospital would respond by introducing rapid antigen testing for all visitors. She said visitors would need to get tested when entering the hospital and return a negative result before being allowed into clinical wards. There were a number of other exposure sites listed across regional Victoria on Sunday, including in Coldstream, Traralgon, Mildura and Bendigo. The full list of exposure sites can be found here . From 6pm on Friday , travel restrictions within Victoria will cease, density limits at hospitality venues will increase only for fully vaccinated people, retail centres will reopen and masks will no longer be required outdoors. The changes will arrive in time for the Melbourne Cup long weekend and coincide with Victoria reaching a key vaccination target – 80 per cent of its population aged 16 and over will be double-dosed. Melbourne students will get an extra few days at school than was expected, with face-to-face learning to resume for all year levels from Monday, November 1, four days ahead of schedule. Universities, swimming pools, nightclubs and gyms will reopen, restaurants will be allowed more indoor diners, outdoor stadiums can welcome up to 5000 vaccinated people, and crowds at weddings and funerals will be permitted from Friday as Victoria moves beyond “locking people down to locking people out”. Premier Daniel Andrews on Sunday warned unvaccinated adults and older children would be barred from accessing all but basic services until 2023 under the Victorian government’s path back to freedom. He said the plan to enforce broad vaccination requirements well into next year gave the state’s public health the confidence to release most social gathering restrictions when 90 per cent of the population was vaccinated.

The number of counties affected by the measures doubled in just one week, from five to 10. They are mostly located in northern Slovakia, on or near the border with Poland and the Czech Republic. Slovakia has 79 counties. The measures include the closure of hotels, bars and restaurants, with people only allowed to buy meals at takeout windows. Fitness, wellness and aquatic centers also have been closed. The maximum number allowed to attend public gatherings is reduced to 100 fully vaccinated people. It's also mandatory to wear face coverings both indoors and outdoors. Slovakia, which has a population of nearly 5.5 million people, is one of the countries in the European Union that have been hardest hit by the pandemic. It has registered around 457,431 cases and 12,917 deaths. Almost 80% of 1,144 people who currently need hospitalization in Slovakia have been only partially vaccinated or haven't received a shot at all.

The county lies in the Mongolia region in the country where the administration has asked thousands of citizens to stay home and warned for civil and criminal action against those not following protocols, according to Bloomberg. In another development, a retired Chinese couple who tested positive for COVID-19, days after they went on a travel spree across the country, has been blamed for the latest spike in cases in the country, raising questions about the efficacy of China’s Zero-COVID policy. China on Friday reported 32 coronavirus cases, including four positive cases in Beijing, the spurt in the capital city causing a sense of disquiet among officials ahead of the winter Olympics early next year. Beijing has been reporting stray cases since Tuesday this week, ending the zero-case record for over two months. Critics say despite periodic outbreaks of infections in different parts of the country posing huge logistic challenges, China has shown no signs of relaxing its costly Zero-COVID policy. China’s National Health Commission, which releases daily updates of cases, said in its latest report that 28 new locally transmitted COVID-19 cases were reported on Thursday in different parts of the country. Separately, Beijing's health authorities reported four cases in the city. The places where the cases were reported included Beijing, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Shaanxi, Ningxia, Guizhou and Qinghai. The current spike in cases was largely attributed to an elderly couple from Shanghai who flew to several cities, including the tourist city of Xian, tested positive for COVID-19, and sent officials on a leather hunt to trace scores of people who had come in contact with them. Within three days of an announcement that the couple had tested positive in Xian on Saturday, hundreds of close contacts of the couple and their five travel companions, who later tested positive, were identified. During this period, several cities had rolled out mass testing, a land port stopped operating and popular locations visited by the group were closed for disinfection, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported. Details of the group’s domestic flights and hotels, stops at roast duck restaurants and noodle shops, was reported by the official media, with people being asked to report whether their movements overlapped with them. Such cases causing periodic outbreaks presents considerable logistical and economic challenges to China despite administering vaccines to three quarters of its population. The inevitability of further cases and a waning of vaccine antibody levels beg the question of how long China should persist with the Zero-COVID policy, the Post report said on Friday. China, which unlike the rest of the world is seeking to pursue a zero case policy by stringently restricting foreign travel, faced increased criticism as the cases reported in smaller numbers continue to surface. Wherever the cases prop up, officials immediately begin testing thousands of people around the area, besides banning flights and trains to prevent local people from travelling. Beijing, where the foreign travel is strictly restricted with 21-day quarantine for foreigners, followed the stringent policy of zero cases as it gears up to host the prestigious Winter Olympics in February next year. China has restricted travel from India and a number of other countries. Despite numerous pleas, China has not permitted over 23,000 Indian students enrolled in Chinese colleges to return besides hundreds of Indians working in the country, stating that it is a preventive measure to contain the spread of the virus.

‘My dad was a hero': Lifesaving Fargo doctor dies at 72 of COVID-19,https://www.inforum.com/news/7252404-%E2%80%98My-dad-was-a-hero-Lifesaving-Fargo-doctor-dies-at-72-of-COVID-19,,,,"Dr. Gerald Kiedrowski helped save the life of a boy who fell through the ice on the Red River in 1987. The boy survived. Four years later, he saved a girl who drowned in Norway. Kiedrowski died Saturday, Oct. 23.",,2021-10-24 22:13:06,"FARGO — Dr. Gerald Kiedrowski was a member of the medical team that revived an 11-year-old boy who was submerged for 45 minutes in the icy water of the Red River in 1987. Kiedrowski was an emergency room physician at the former St. Luke’s Hospital and restarted the heart of Alvaro Garza, a Moorhead boy who fell through the ice and was fished out of the frigid waters by emergency responders. The boy's core body temperature had fallen to 77 degrees. His blood was warmed by a heart-and-lung machine. In an uncanny second act four years later, while vacationing in Norway, Kiedrowski pulled a 10-year-old girl from the submerged hull of a capsized sailboat and saved her life by performing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation while the girl was taken by lifeboat to shore. “My dad was a hero,” said Megan Kiedrowski Bisers-Espelien on Sunday, Oct. 24. Gerald Kiedrowski died Saturday at age 72 at Sanford Health of COVID-19, she said. Just before he was intubated, realizing that his illness was serious enough that he might not survive, Kiedrowski left a consoling note for his family. His wife, Marilyn, discovered the note on Kiedrowski’s cell phone on Sunday, hours after his death. “Do not be sad,” the note said. “I’m going to heaven. I’m going to be playing golf with my dad.” Kiedrowski was a modest man who gave the credit for his healing hands to God, his daughter said. “He would say, ‘God wanted him to be alive and he was just His tool,” Bisers-Espelien said, recalling her father’s reaction to helping save Garza’s life. “He was very humble.” His reaction was the same after he saved the Norwegian girl. While others held his ankles, he was able to reach her, untangle her hair, and lift her out of the water. “I have to convince the others that there was still hope,” Kiedrowski told a Norwegian newspaper in 1991. Able to speak Norwegian, Kiedrowski told the others at the scene of the drowning that he was a doctor and could help. “Again, he believed God had him in that place,” Bisers-Espelien said. The family of the Norwegian girl, now a grown woman 30 years after the boating accident, has kept in touch with Kiedrowski, calling him every year to give thanks. Kiedrowski had planned to meet the family for the first time next year, his daughter said. “He was grateful that he could make a difference and save another life,” Bisers-Espelien said. “That’s why he became a doctor.” After spending years practicing medicine in Fargo, Kiedrowski moved to St. Cloud, where he was an urgent care doctor for 10 years before returning to Fargo in 2015 to be near family. He kept working part-time at the VA Medical Center until his illness. “He never retired,” Bisers-Espelien said. To better communicate with his patients, Kiedrowski learned multiple languages, most recently Somali. He spoke German and Russian fluently, she said. Kiedrowski was dedicated to his family and to his patients, even making house calls for members of his congregation, Grace City Church. “He always had a passion for people,” Bisers-Espelien said. “In a way, he could see in people’s souls, I think.” Her father tended to his family’s medical needs, never more dramatically than when Bisers-Espelien suffered an accidental gunshot wound to her neck that could have been fatal. Her father, who had gone deer hunting, left open his gun case, and a childhood friend accidentally shot her. Kiedrowski flew home that night and assisted in the operating room, twice resuscitating his daughter and, she believes, saving her life. “He took over,” Bisers-Espelien said. The bullet severed her spine, a paralyzing wound that left her in a wheelchair. Her father gave her support and encouragement that got her through a lengthy recuperation and therapy. Kiedrowski, who was born in the Twin Cities suburb of Richfield, Minn., spent most of his medical career in Fargo. Besides St. Luke’s, now Sanford Health, he worked at the former St. John’s Hospital and St. Ansgar Hospital in Moorhead. Devoutly religious, Kiedrowski was a member of the Gideon Society, which distributes Bibles. He is survived by his wife, Marilyn, eight children from two marriages and 27 grandchildren. Funeral arrangements are pending with Korsmo Funeral Services.",https://www.inforum.com/incoming/7252405-5z2efz-Dr.-Gerald-Kiedrowski.JPG/alternates/BASE_LANDSCAPE/Dr.%20Gerald%20Kiedrowski.JPG,inforum
Sonu Sood organises vaccination awareness drive in Mumbai,https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/entertainment/sonu-sood-organises-vaccination-awareness-drive-in-mumbai-328998,,,,"Mumbai, October 24 Sonu Sood is a name that has become synonymous with relief measures in the country. The actor once again stepped up to spread awareness about vaccination as he visited Kala Qila in Mumbai's Dharavi with frontline workers and their children to spread awareness on the importance of vaccination. India recently crossed the mark of 100 crore covid-19 vaccination doses. As we move forward on the path of recovery and putting the pandemic behind us, the concern with regards to the inoculation of slum dwellers still looms large. The road to achieving public safety from the pandemic starts from inoculation. Talking about the same, Sonu said, ""We cannot take the covid situation lightly as of yet. According to many researchers, there are many individuals in the slum areas who are not yet vaccinated. The idea is to get the entire nation jabbed to be corona-free."" Talking about the cause further, he said, ""With our Sunday drive, my agenda is to encourage maximum people to get their doses.

In dem Clip, der am vergangenen Donnerstag im Rahmen der wöchentlichen Live-Ansprache aufgenommen wurde, hatte der rechtsextreme Staatschef von negativen Auswirkungen der Corona-Impfstoffe für HIV-Infizierte gesprochen. Er zitierte dabei ""offizielle Berichte"" der britischen Regierung, wonach vollständig Geimpfte schneller ein Immunschwächesyndrom entwickeln würden. ""Ich empfehle Ihnen, den Artikel zu lesen"", sagte Bolsonaro, ohne zu erwähnen, woher die Informationen stammen. Einwöchige Zwangspause Am Montag wurde das Video von beiden Plattformen gelöscht. Gleichzeitig verhängte Youtube eine einwöchige Sperre für den Präsidenten. Zur Begründung heißt es von Youtube, man habe das Video von Bolsonaros Kanal entfernt, weil es gegen die firmeneigenen medizinischen Desinformationsrichtlinien zu COVID-19 verstoße. Facebook äußerte sich ähnlich. ""Die Behauptung, Corona-Schutzimpfungen würden Menschen töten oder ernsthaft schädigen, verstößt gegen unsere Grundsätze"", so ein Sprecher des Konzerns. Kritik am Präsidenten: ""Bolsonaros Maske gegen das Coronavirus"" (Archivbild) Die Behauptung Bolsonaros wurde mittlerweile auch von britischer Seite widerlegt. Die Regierung in London bestritt die Existenz von Berichten zu diesem Thema. Ein brasilianischer Ärzteverband teilte zudem mit, es gebe keine Erkenntnisse über einen Zusammenhang zwischen den Corona-Impfstoffen und Aids. Nach Angaben des UNAIDS-Programms der Vereinten Nationen können die meisten HIV-positiven Menschen problemlos mit den von den jeweiligen Gesundheitsbehörden freigegebenen Vakzinen geimpft werden. Bolsonaro, der im Juli 2020 positiv auf Corona getestet wurde , hat sich bisher nicht impfen lassen. Gleichzeitig sorgte er mehrfach mit umstrittenen Äußerungen zu den Impfstoffen für Aufsehen. Unter anderem sagte er, wenn sich jemand nach der Impfung ""in einen Alligatoren"" verwandle, sei das sein Problem. djo/kle (afp, rtre)",,dw

KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 26 ― The blanket ban on political gatherings for the Melaka election campaign will be enforced equally on all parties whether they are pro-government or in the Opposition, Datuk Seri Wan Junaidi Tuanku Jaafar said in the Dewan Rakyat today.The minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Law and Parliament) was responding to Kulim Bandar Baharu MP Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail who sought an assurance from the government that it would apply the law equally on all political parties campaigning in next month’s Melaka state election.The Pakatan Harapan lawmaker suggested the possibility that politicians with the ruling government may attempt to circumvent the ban and meet with constituents to garner support through “official” functions, pointing out that the Opposition would be at a disadvantage when they are prohibited from organising any forms of gatherings related to political campaigning.“What we do not wish for is a double standard. When the government organises, they use the National Security Council’s SOPs. When we organise, they use the Election Commission’s SOPs.“This will create tension and uncontrolled anger. I want to pre-empt the minister. So I want a thorough explanation from YB. If allowed, say it's allowed and if it's disallowed, say it's disallowed,” Saifuddin Nasution said during the Minister’s Question Time.As Melaka is currently under Phase Four of the National Recovery Plan (NRP), official government events are allowed for individuals who have obtained their full vaccination while subjected to the event’s space capacity and physical distancing measures.Wan Junaidi replied that the authorities apply the law equally on all, but added that he will still discuss this issue at the next Cabinet meeting.“Actually we do not practise double standards... and I am speaking on behalf of the Election Commission, NSC and the Health Ministry.“But for now, I cannot give a guarantee about the political activism that is set to take place. But I take note of YB’s question and I will raise this in the next Cabinet meeting to ask ministers to not circumvent the SOPs by KKM and NSC,” he said.NSC refers to the National Security Council, which still issues regulations Covid-19 while KKM refers to the Health Ministry by its Malay initials.On October 24, Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin announced the prohibition of all activities, gatherings or social meetings related to political campaigning for the Melaka polls to prevent the coronavirus from surging again, citing the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act 1988, also known as Act 342.MORE TO COME                                                                                               ",2021-10-26 03:23:41,,,malaymail

Ministers are under fire as daily cases topped 50,000 for the first time since lockdown ended and 223 people died in one day last week. Brits have been urged to get booster jabs to ‘protect the freedom and Christmas that we have all earned’ by the medical director of NHS England. But a model from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine suggests infections will peak in the coming weeks before nosediving over winter, The Telegraph reports. Experts predict cases could fall by 85% before Christmas in other unpublished models, it’s understood. The dramatic decline in infections ‘will happen without’ the introduction of mandatory face masks, vaccine passports and working from home measures. Sage member John Edmunds, a professor in the Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, said: ‘When we were doing the work about two weeks ago, the Health Secretary had made it very clear that the government was not planning to introduce Plan B in the near future ‘Our model was projecting that cases would start to decline some time in the autumn. ‘However, the model also suggests that cases may start to climb again in the spring, due to a combination of waning immunity and increased contacts.’ Cases in schools are believed to be driving the current coronavirus wave, but top scientists believe this will wane as children’s immunity builds. More than 50,000 daily covid cases were recorded for the first time since 17 July on Thursday (Picture: PA) However, the modelling comes as other experts caution vaccines are not enough to stop Covid. Professor Adam Finn, who is on the Joint Committee of Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), has warned against complacency amid the ‘worsening situation in the NHS’. He told Sky News: ‘The vaccines principally are very effective at stopping people from getting seriously ill. ‘They’re not so effective unfortunately at stopping infections altogether or stopping the virus from being spread about. ‘They do have an effect on that, but they’re not by themselves going to be enough at the present time to keep the spread of the virus under control. ‘And we do need to see people continuing to make efforts to avoid contact, to avoid transmission, and to do other things as well as get vaccinated if we’re going to stop this rise from going up further.’ He added: ‘Just giving more people vaccines, including people who maybe don’t actually need the vaccines yet, could actually run the risk of making things worse rather than better. ‘If you boost people before they actually need the vaccine, it is in some senses a waste of vaccine, but also it means that you are immunising them earlier and they may make a smaller response to the vaccine and that response may wear off earlier. ‘So I think the idea of just getting more doses indiscriminately into people’s arms is not really necessarily going to solve the problem.’ Health Secretary Sajid Javid is said to have set up a ‘war room’ where he is holding daily meetings on how to tackle the crisis. Labour has called for Plan B to be imposed immediately, with Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves claiming the vaccine programme is ‘stalling’. The Government is likely to introduce mandatory jabs for NHS staff to protect the vulnerable, despite warnings of legal challenges. Mr Javid said a final decision had not been taken yet ‘but it is something that I’m heading towards’. He told Times Radio: ‘We’ve been very clear and open about this, working with our friends in the NHS, and the reason for this is if you’re working in the NHS, that fantastic work you’re doing every day, you yourself are more susceptible to this virus because you’re just much more likely to come into contact with it, but also the people that you’re looking after are more vulnerable and that’s why they’re in hospital, they’ve got health needs, and this is about protecting them and protecting yourself.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.

‘Everyone is involved’: Joy as Big Scream Festival returns to Dublin’s inner city,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/everyone-is-involved-joy-as-big-scream-festival-returns-to-dublin-s-inner-city-1.4709652?localLinksEnabled=false,,,,"The Big Scream Festival is back in Dublin’s northeast inner city, with an eight-day Halloween programme this year that signals a further return of social activity in the capital. The festival began several years ago in response to increasing concerns about the lack of outlets for young people in the run-up to Halloween and ensuing problems with the stockpiling of tyres and other materials for large, anti-social bonfires. There were also concerns about alcohol and drugs being consumed at the latter unregulated events. “We wanted to divert the young people away from that and also provide something for everyone to get involved in,” said festival chairman Peter O’Connor. “It’s about listening to the young people, seeing what they want and if it can’t be done, explaining that to them. And in fairness the young people are brilliant. They have some great ideas, but you have to listen to them and communicate with them, so they feel part of it, not ignored. “If we can get the young kids now – the six-, seven-, eight- and nine-year-olds – to these events, make it part of what Halloween means to them, then when they become 13, 14, maybe the tyre collecting and bonfire making won’t be so attractive. “Everybody pulls together, works together, it works out great. We have Dublin City Council, the gardaí, the schools, the senior citizens, new communities, local businesses – everyone is involved.” Olympic openers Boxing Olympians Kellie Harrington and Emmet Brennan were on hand in Mountjoy Square on Sunday to open this year’s festival, which was all but cancelled last year, with most events online only. “You couldn’t really do anything. So at least this year we have the option of outdoors and that’s where most events will be,” said Mr O’Connor. It was “impossible to put a value” on a “normal, bright, happy day” such as that on Sunday, after the “heavy impact” Covid had had, said Noel Wardick, chief executive of the Dublin City Community Co-operative. “It has really heavily impacted people, with the lockdowns, the loss of work, the lack of space, overcrowding. It has been traumatic. We just know, from a mental health perspective events like this are really important to lift people. “This event has grown into a key event in the local social calendar. To have it cancelled last year, it was very hard on families.” Kellie Harrington meets Dracula at Dublin’s Mounjoy Square during the Big Scream Festival. Photograph: Leon Farrell/Photocall Ireland Dracula – aka David Herlihy – said he was “very proud” to be back in the streets where his creator, Bram Stoker, had spent his teenage years. “He was living in Buckingham Street but he went to school in Parnell Square. Every day he walked through the inner city all of those years. You know, I come to Ireland every year on my holidays because these streets are where I feel most at home.” Dressing up Among those most enthusiastic about the week ahead were Darla Harris (4), Lexy Hopkins (9), Lacey O’Neill (10), Kendall O’Neill (6), Harper O’Neill (9), and Isabella Byrne (8), who were all queuing for facepainting. All like dressing up and sweets, and seeing their friends after dark. “It’s a bit like Christmas. You get sweets instead of presents, and go out in the night with your friends,” said Lacey. “The Big Scream is great because they organise lots of fun activities for us.” Daily events will culminate next weekend with a two-day “creep carnival” in the grounds of O’Connell’s School on the North Circular Road, along with a parade of little vampires. Among other events will be fancy-dress competitions, spooky dance and music workshops, a Halloween fairy-garden aimed at younger children, arts classes for adults, singalongs held in senior citizens’ complexes, cultural walking tours, and entertainment on the Royal Canal Greenway on Halloween night.

So at least this year we have the option of outdoors and that’s where most events will be,” said Mr O’Connor. It was “impossible to put a value” on a “normal, bright, happy day” such as that on Sunday, after the “heavy impact” Covid had had, said Noel Wardick , chief executive of the Dublin City Community Co-operative. “It has really heavily impacted people, with the lockdowns, the loss of work, the lack of space, overcrowding. It has been traumatic. We just know, from a mental health perspective events like this are really important to lift people. “This event has grown into a key event in the local social calendar. To have it cancelled last year, it was very hard on families.” Dracula – aka David Herlihy – said he was “very proud” to be back in the streets where his creator, Bram Stoker , had spent his teenage years. “He was living in Buckingham Street but he went to school in Parnell Square. Every day he walked through the inner city all of those years. You know, I come to Ireland every year on my holidays because these streets are where I feel most at home.” Among those most enthusiastic about the week ahead were Darla Harris (4), Lexy Hopkins (9), Lacey O’Neill (10), Kendall O’Neill (6), Harper O’Neill (9), and Isabella Byrne (8), who were all queuing for facepainting. All like dressing up and sweets, and seeing their friends after dark. “It’s a bit like Christmas. You get sweets instead of presents, and go out in the night with your friends,” said Lacey. “The Big Scream is great because they organise lots of fun activities for us.” Daily events will culminate next weekend with a two-day “creep carnival” in the grounds of O’Connell’s School on the North Circular Road , along with a parade of little vampires. Among other events will be fancy-dress competitions, spooky dance and music workshops, a Halloween fairy-garden aimed at younger children, arts classes for adults, singalongs held in senior citizens’ complexes, cultural walking tours, and entertainment on the Royal Canal Greenway on Halloween night.

Moderna vaccine shows strong immune response in kids 6 to 11,https://www.wcpo.com/news/national/coronavirus/moderna-says-it-covid-19-vaccine-shows-strong-immune-response-in-kids-6-to-11,,,,"Moderna announced Monday that its COVID-19 vaccine has proven to be effective when administered to children ages 6 to 11, citing a new study.","Moderna announced Monday that its COVID-19 vaccine has proven to be effective when administered to children ages 6 to 11, citing a new study.The company says an interim analysis of data showed a robust neutralizing antibody response after two 50 microgram doses of its vaccine were administered to kids in this age group.The study evaluated the safety, tolerability, reactogenicity and effectiveness of two doses of the Moderna vaccine given to healthy children 28 days apart.Moderna says its vaccine was well tolerated with a safety and tolerability profile generally consistent with its study of adolescents and adults.The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate in severity, with the most common being fatigue, headache, fever, and injection site pain, according to the company.Moderna now plans to submit the data from the study to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA), and other global regulators.“We are encouraged by the immunogenicity and safety profile of mRNA-1273 in children aged 6 to under 12 years and are pleased that the study met its primary immunogenicity endpoints,” said Stéphane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer of Moderna. “We look forward to filing with regulators globally and remain committed to doing our part to help end the COVID-19 pandemic with a vaccine for adults and children of all ages.”Meanwhile, Pfizer has already asked federal regulators to authorize the emergency use of its coronavirus vaccine for children ages 5 to 11. An advisory panel for the FDA will consider that company's application on Tuesday.Top health officials, like Dr. Anthony Fauci, have said they believe the vaccine will be approved for emergency use in kids and the U.S. could start seeing the age group being vaccinated in early November.“So if all goes well, and we get the regulatory approval, and the recommendations from the CDC, it's entirely possible, if not, very likely that vaccines will be available for children from 5 to 11 within the first week or two of November,” said Fauci told CNN on Sunday.",2021-10-25 14:28:54,,,wcpo

Authorities say there is no risk to the public and staff, or breach of health orders.",,2021-10-25 01:40:11,"Queensland police were called to a “minor disturbance” at the dedicated COVID-19 hospital where a Gold Coast ride-share driver was last week too sick to speak to authorities, after the man was found outside his negative pressure isolation room. The 36-year-old, Duran Raman, was taken to the Gold Coast University Hospital on Wednesday, 10 days after returning to Queensland via Melbourne, with police launching an ongoing investigation into how he crossed the border without going into quarantine. While unable to provide details due to privacy reasons, a Queensland Health spokeswoman said there was no risk to the public or staff. Credit: Nine On Friday, Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young said the fit and otherwise healthy man — identified as Mr Raman — was “very unwell”, receiving high-flow oxygen and would probably need intensive care. Officers were then called to the hospital about 9am on Sunday after a “minor disturbance”, but the matter was resolved quickly and without any issues, a police spokeswoman said in a statement. “Police are not investigating an incident at a health facility on the Gold Coast,” she said. “There was no breach of a public health direction detected.” A source with knowledge of the matter, but not authorised to speak publicly, said Mr Raman was found outside the isolation room but still within the hospital’s dedicated COVID-19 ward. While unable to provide details due to privacy reasons, a Queensland Health spokeswoman said there was also no risk to the public or staff. “All patients isolating in COVID-19 wards are required to stay in their rooms until they are discharged,” she said. Queensland again reported no new cases of the virus on Monday, from almost 6000 tests in the previous 24 hours. After his case was announced by authorities last week, Mr Raman’s serious condition was said to have worsened and his inability to speak further hampering efforts to track his interstate movements in the three weeks before returning to Queensland. This occurred on October 10, via Melbourne, with police and health officials trying to figure out how he managed to cross the border without going into quarantine and spending 10 days infectious in the Gold Coast community. On Friday, chief health officer Jeannette Young said she believed he was that sick he may have done little travelling beyond the Broadbeach resort apartment he lived in alone. Despite the concerns raised by the case, no further infections have yet been linked. A number of new exposure sites have been listed by contact tracers in recent days linked to interstate truck drivers who spent time in the community while infectious. Police were looking into the movements of one of those on Friday , who went to a cinema and barber in Brisbane despite freight industry protocols requiring drivers to have “no or minimal” contact with the community and to leave their vehicle only for essential reasons.

The Samhain sorcerers – aka Derry City and Strabane District Council – have opened not one, not two, but five netherworlds filled with ancient spirits, digital wonders and dark, nightmarish visions. Three of these illuminated worlds will be spread across Derry city, with one in nearby Strabane and another in Buncrana, Co Donegal. Each world will feature its own programmes, including installations, large-scale inflatables, aerial acrobatics, choreographed displays and cutting-edge live music.

The 42-piece Irish Chamber Orchestra will bring the icing on the cake to such perennial Irish rock anthems as Celebrate, After All, Don’t Go, Mary and Parachute. And Irish Women in Harmony, featuring Tolu Makay, Aimee, Erica Cody, Faye O’Rourke, Eve Belle and Ailbhe Reddy, will perform 1980s and 1990s classics such as Mandinka, Linger and When Love Comes to Town.

School libraries move into the digital age,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/school-libraries-move-into-the-digital-age-1.4702822?localLinksEnabled=false,,,,"Trinity Comprehensive School in Ballymun has a striking design. Formed from the amalgamation of three post-primaries during the first phase of the stalled Ballymun regeneration project, the corridors at Trinity all wrap around an innovative school library. At any time of the day, the library – staffed by a full-time professional librarian – is a hive of activity. All students have at least one class timetabled in the library every week. Chess boards have grown into chess clubs. Poetry, creative writing, accelerated reading and events all happen there: the most recent event was the launch of the new book from RTÉ’s outgoing Washington correspondent, Brian O’Donovan, Four Years in the Cauldron. The librarian is constantly engaged with the students to make sure they are accessing the books they want – whether fiction, non-fiction or graphic novels – and also works with teachers to promote cross-curricular links. “A school library is transformational,” says Frances Neary, principal of Trinity Comprehensive. “It has given our students the opportunity to express themselves, to find words for their emotions without being judged, and simply to read for enjoyment rather than because they have to. “It is a place of refuge, escape, creativity, imagination and learning. But the librarian is central: otherwise, it’s just a room full of books without anyone there to show the potential within these books, without anyone to encourage and engage the students.” In 2005, a three-year pilot project to provide libraries to 10 disadvantaged schools issued its report. This led to a commitment to expand school libraries to 50 support school programmes with the highest level of disadvantage by 2010, with further expansion to be considered thereafter. But the expansion went on hold during the recession and, more than a decade later, has never been realised. Meaningful impact “There are now 30 libraries in the programme, which leaves over 200 Deis/ Junior Cycle Support Programme (JCSP) schools that don’t have school library supports,” says Kathleen Moran, senior librarian with the JCSP Demonstration Library Project. “It was disappointing to see there was nothing for school libraries in the recent budget. We’ve been knocking on the door for so long but it has never been back on the table.” Budget 2022 saw the Department of Education commit €20 million as a once-off capital allocation to schools for the purchase of books, audio books and other equipment. But Moran and principals of schools say that these resources need a library and a librarian if they are to make a meaningful impact. Brian O’Donovan, RTÉ Washington correspondent, launching his book, Four Years in the Cauldron, with Frank Christian Ajoc and Thembi Nkosi at Trinity Comprehensive School in Ballymun. Photograph: Damien Eagers At St Paul’s CBS, North Brunswick Street, Dublin 7, school principal Patrick McCormack says that their library has improved student engagement and retention. “I believe that every secondary school should have a library,” he says. “A fully resourced library is not just books on a shelf, but is a librarian working with the teaching staff and students in the school. “We have interactive materials, games, educational software and recreational spaces. We lend chess sets, board games and, crucially, digital readers to students. Schools should not have to be begging for this: it should be a nailed-on, protected resource.” The closure of the library during Covid, and subsequent restrictions and limitations on access, has brought this home for McCormack. “A box of books is not the same as a librarian who is a friendly face for the students and a person they can get support from. Our librarian, Annie Brady, was chosen as Librarian of the Year for the whole of Ireland and the UK in 2015. She organises coffee morning for the parents, she links in with the local primary school so that when children come to our secondary, they’re already familiar with the library. Storytelling classes “She involves herself with the teachers, SNAs and students; she makes sure the student voice is heard; she supports professional development; she runs oral storytelling classes with professional seanchaís; she organises musicians and other speakers to come in.” Moran oversees and supports all 30 of these libraries, but she has limited resources. The JCSP library project works with organisations like Poetry Ireland, Children’s Books Ireland, public libraries and third-level libraries. One particularly interesting initiative involved a collaboration with the Museum of Literature Ireland (MoLI), UCD’s school of English and astrophysics researchers at the UCD school of physics involving creative writing workshops. Students did online Zoom tutorials to write a poem on the theme of home, which has been etched onto the side of EirSat, Ireland’s first satellite (developed by UCD’s C-Space, the first Irish centre dedicated to collaborative space research and industry). Having had four administrative support staff when the project started, Moran is essentially alone now. At the same time, the demand for their services increased dramatically during Covid. “Our libraries were emptied of devices during Covid: we loaned them so young people could stay engaged,” says Moran.

We’ve been knocking on the door for so long.” Photograph: Damien Eagers “We do whatever needs to be done. We help close the achievement gap. The formal education system does not suit everyone and school libraries can come at learning from a different way, a way that suits every learner. “I had hundreds of requests from non-Deis schools for access to our digital library service during Covid, as well as requests for access from over 100 Youthreach centres,” says Moran. “I have quotations from suppliers to expand our digital library access to all 750 second-level schools and we could set it up very quickly if the funding and administrative supports were provided. “The set-up cost would be minimal and the main cost would be the purchase of additional ebooks, e-audiobooks and digital magazines – all of which would then be available to students and staff in every school in the country.” No school library? Visit your local It’s a simple but radical idea in many ways: a dedicated building where people can get books, audiobooks, educational resources and use of computers – all for free. In 2019, Ireland abolished library fines, another quietly radical move that has made this national resource more accessible to all. “It was a barrier to accessing information,” says Stuart Hamilton, head of libraries development at the Local Government Management Association. “Someone might get a fine in the early part of their library use and it deters them from going back. So now we trust them, and because people have such a positive relationship with their library, there’s a feeling of mutual trust and a social responsibility.” There are over seven million library visits per year, and the number of active members is growing.

Digital services have expanded to allow users to borrow audio books. The library’s Right to Read programme involves four different events for children throughout the year, all aimed at increasing literacy and developing a love of reading. “The buildings had to close during Covid, but we made it easier for people to join online,” says Hamilton. “We ran book clubs, coding events and children’s story time through Zoom, and discovered new audiences. We did home delivery services for some users and worked with Age Action to get older people online.

The Netherlands has one of the fastest-rising infection rates in Europe. The 7-day rolling average of daily new cases increased over the past two weeks from 13.43 new cases per 100,000 people to 29.27 new cases per 100,000 people on Oct. 24. “It’s just going too fast. We have to face up to the fact that the numbers are rising faster and sooner than expected,” Health Minister Hugo De Jonge told reporters in The Hague. He said hospital admissions also are rising faster than anticipated when the government relaxed its lockdown last month. “The Cabinet will have to think about extra measures,” he said. The Netherlands ended almost all COVID-19 restrictions on Sept. 25, including an end to social distancing. At the same time, the government mandated use of coronavirus health passes to get into bars, restaurants, cinemas and other public venues. De Jonge said that a press conference will be held next Tuesday to announce the next steps. The government had planned its press conference for next Friday. More than 18,000 people in the Netherlands are confirmed to have died of COVID-19, thought the true death toll is thought to be higher. ___ Follow AP’s pandemic coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic The Associated Press",,richmond-news

But while a mouse is simple in concept, the market for them is a scattered field of mouse genres, prices, and designs. You need to know a little about the landscape when you go shopping for a new model. Over time, distinct classes of mice have evolved, each made for different computing situations. The most common of these is the mainstream desktop mouse, designed for use with a desktop or laptop PC at a desk or table. Aside from the inevitable right and left mouse buttons, the usual features are a clickable scroll wheel and, in some cases, additional thumb buttons that let you navigate forward and back in your web browser. Travel mice (or ""mobile mice"") offer many of these same features but come in a smaller size. They're designed to fit easily into the pocket of a backpack or laptop bag. For this same reason, however, travel mice tend to be small for most hands—you can use them just fine for short stints, but they become uncomfortable over long periods due to the unnatural grip required. Generally speaking, travel mice are wireless and battery-powered, so you may want to bring along a spare set of AA or AAA batteries if that is what they use. Beyond these ""ordinary"" mice are two key mouse genres: the gaming mouse, and the ergonomic mouse. There's a lot of variance within each, and some crossover among all of these classes. (For example, a few ""travel gaming"" mice exist.) Let's take a look at the gaming field first, then move on to other genres and aspects that affect all mice. Gaming mice amplify every element of the basic mouse concept to the extreme: more buttons, higher tracking resolutions, curvier curves. Some gaming mice are general gaming models, while others are designed for specific game genres. In the latter case, depending upon the style of the game that the mouse is intended for (first-person shooter, real-time strategy game, MMO ), you may see a variety of specialized features. What most gaming mice have in common, though, is a combination of high-performance parts—laser sensors, feather-light click buttons, gold-plated USB connectors—and customization features, such as programmable macro commands and on-the-fly resolution switching. Gaming mice also stand apart in that the better ones tend to feature vendor-supplied software for setting up these custom features and shortcuts, defined sometimes on a per-game basis via profiles. The software's quality and functionality can vary wildly from vendor to vendor; that's where our reviews come in. Certain utilities are easier to pick up than others. For maximum comfort, some gaming mice let you customize the body of the mouse itself. Removable weights are common, letting you tweak the total heft of the mouse one way or the other. Some models take this even further, letting you shift the center of balance, or adjust the height and pitch of the palm rest. For non-gamers, these features are overkill; for dedicated gamers, they provide a competitive edge. Finding the ideal gaming mouse for you comes down to knowing your preferred style of game, determining whether or not you will take advantage of any of a mouse's more complex functions (it's easy to overspend on a gaming mouse), and then tweaking your choice to your specific tastes. Drive by our gaming mouse roundup for much more detail on the nuances of these mice. Ergonomics-first designs put all of the typical mouse functions into a form factor that places your hand in a neutral position. Designed to reduce the stresses that can lead to carpal tunnel and repetitive strain injury, ergonomic mice may look unusual and take some getting used to, but they do alleviate some very real problems. Some have a vertical design; others may have one-off sculpts. Whether you're looking at a specialized ergonomic mouse, or comfort is simply a concern in a more ordinary one, pay attention to the size of your mouse. (Make sure that it's not too big or too small for your hand.) Weight is also a consideration. Some people prefer a heavier mouse that anchors the hand, while others, especially players of MOBA games, want something light that furnishes little resistance to flicking and clicking. As a rule of thumb, a heavier mouse requires more effort to move, and even though the difference may not seem like much, over time it can mount. It's not just weight and size that are important. The sculpting of the mouse can also lead to unnecessary strain on (or conversely, extra support for) your hand and wrist. The most comfortable mice will fit the contour of your hand, rather than having a flat, shallow shape. Some mice have a thumb rest, providing a resting spot from which the finger can rise as needed to activate controls. (See our guide to the best ergonomic mice for more about the nuances of these very variable mice, in addition to a discussion of trackballs.) The simplest way to hook up a mouse to your PC is through a wired USB connection. Computer mice are usually plug-and-play devices, with no additional software to install (with the exception of higher-end gaming mice), meaning that plugging in the cable is all the setup you'll need to deal with. Unlike wireless alternatives, a wired device will draw its power over USB, so there are no batteries to worry about. Wired connections are also preferable for serious gaming or esports use (no battery to conk out in the midst of a match), though some high-end wireless mice are indistinguishable, from a response-time perspective, from wired ones. If you want more freedom and less cable clutter on your desk, however, it's hard to beat a wireless mouse. Instead of a wired connection, wireless mice transmit data to your PC through one of two primary means: an RF connection to a USB receiver, or via Bluetooth. (Some mice actually support both, but this is less common than supporting just one.) Both have their pros and cons, but if you want to reduce the number of cables on your desk and gain the flexibility to use your mouse unhindered—or even from across the room—wireless is the way to go. Most wireless mice connect to the host computer via the same 2.4GHz wireless frequency used by cordless phones and some Wi-Fi Internet bands. A dime-size USB dongle—small enough to plug in and forget about—provides the link to your PC. Know, however, that only in some isolated cases (such as with Logitech's Unifying-branded gear) can a single USB dongle provide connectivity to more than one device. That means that unless the vendor specifically notes otherwise, you can't use the same adapter for your wireless mouse and keyboard . You may need to devote two USB ports to separate mouse and keyboard USB dongles. Bluetooth options, in contrast, don't monopolize a USB port, and the stable, easy-to-manage connections are ideal for use with mobile devices, such as ultraportables , tablet PCs , and 2-in-1s . In regular use, a Bluetooth connection gives you roughly 30 feet of wireless range, but a Bluetooth mouse may not match the battery life offered by devices with an RF-based USB dongle. New innovations, such as motion sensors tied to power and connection management, can improve the battery life versus older Bluetooth devices, which maintained an always-on link that drained battery relatively quickly. But you'll want to look at the vendors' estimated battery life on a charge (as well as whether the mouse uses an internal battery you recharge, or disposables). Most of today's mice use one of two types of light-based motion sensor: optical/LED, or laser. Unlike mechanical tracking options of yore, light-based sensors have fewer issues with dust and dirt, and the absence of moving parts means fewer failures. Optical sensors pair a glowing LED beam—often red, blue, or infrared—with a small photo sensor, tracking movement by repeatedly imaging the surface below the mouse, translating any movement of the mouse into cursor movement. (The frequency of this imaging is called the ""polling rate,"" expressed as hertz, or hundreds of instances per second.) Because of the imaging sensor used, optical mice are a little less prone to problems caused by lifting the mouse when in use or by mousing on an uneven surface. Laser mice operate in a similar way, but they use an infrared laser diode instead of an LED. This allows, in some cases, for greater potential sensitivity (measured in dots per inch, or dpi) and polling rates. The one drawback is that they can be finicky about the surfaces on which they are used. Premium gaming mice generally use laser sensors, and they tend to work better with opaque mouse-pad surfaces meant for mousing; LEDs can be more forgiving. But this is not an absolute, and frankly, if you're concerned at all about mousing precision, a basic mouse pad will solve all ails. To offer the higher sensitivity of a laser sensor and the versatility of an optical mouse, a few isolated mice use both in tandem. Most better gaming mice also offer sensitivity adjustment, letting you shift from a precision setting for tight cursor-control circumstances (such as lining up a sniper's shot) to a broader-sweep one for melee combat and run-and-gun situations, or panning across an RTS world. This may be via dedicated-purpose button, or you may be able to program one of the mouse's buttons or toggles to execute resolution/sensitivity changes on the fly.

It’s no surprise at this point that these Apple Silicon chips are extremely powerful, but a new benchmark test run with Affinity’s tool shows that the M1 Max’s GPU beats the $6000 AMD Radeon Pro W6900X for some tasks. The tests were conducted by Andy Somerfield, lead developer of the popular image editor Affinity Photo. In a Twitter thread , Somerfield details how the Affinity team has been optimizing its software for Apple Silicon chips since the first version of Affinity Photo for iPad, and how far the performance of these chips has come with the latest MacBook Pro. Since a single benchmark doesn’t necessarily indicate how fast a GPU is, Affinity has developed its own tool to measure the performance of tasks related to its apps like Affinity Photo and Affinity Designer. For instance, the developer explains that Affinity Photo runs best with a GPU that has high compute performance, fast on-chip bandwidth, and fast transfer on and off the GPU. The fastest GPU that the Affinity team had ever tested in their benchmark tool was the expensive AMD Radeon Pro W6900X, which Apple sells for $6000 as an MPX module for the Mac Pro. The Radeon Pro W6900X has 32GB of GDDR6 memory that delivers up to 512GB/s of memory bandwidth. Even so, it was outperformed by Apple’s M1 Max GPU with 32 cores and 400GB/s of unified bandwidth memory. The #M1Max is the fastest GPU we have ever measured in the @affinitybyserif Photo benchmark. It outperforms the W6900X – a $6000, 300W desktop part – because it has immense compute performance, immense on-chip bandwidth and immediate transfer of data on and off the GPU (UMA). pic.twitter.com/iPg3L56y2u — Andy Somerfield (@andysomerfield) October 25, 2021 In the “Raster (Single GPU)” test, Apple’s GPU scored 32891, while AMD’s GPU comes right behind with 32580 benchmark points. Of course, as the developer explains, this doesn’t mean that the M1 Max GPU will perform better at every task. But it definitely shows how capable Apple’s chips are, and also that they can be better for image editing than a dedicated high-end GPU. Geekbench 5 tests recently showed that the M1 Max offers up to 181% faster graphics than the GPUs found in the previous 16-inch MacBook Pro. Both the new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro will be available in stores beginning Tuesday.

Negotiators edge closer to global carbon market deal at COP26,https://phys.org/news/2021-10-edge-closer-global-carbon-cop26.html,,,,"Nations are edging toward a deal that could create a global carbon market when they meet in Scotland for COP26 climate talks in about a week, after Brazil signaled it's willing to compromise.",,2021-10-25 15:57:04,"Nations are edging toward a deal that could create a global carbon market when they meet in Scotland for COP26 climate talks in about a week, after Brazil signaled it's willing to compromise. Brazil softened its stance on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which aims to create a framework for countries and companies to meet their climate goals by trading carbon credits , according to people familiar with the issue, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. The South American nation has a lot of leverage because the Amazon rainforest—one of the biggest carbon sinks in the world—would generate a large amount of credits in any global offsets market overseen by the United Nations. Brazil's willingness to be more flexible is a change after its reluctance to compromise with the European Union at the 2019 Madrid talks led to a deadlock in the negotiations. The new tone comes as businesses have put pressure on President Jair Bolsonaro to resolve the Article 6 debate. Around 100 chief executive officers of large companies recently signed a letter urging him to clarify Brazil's stance on major issues to be discussed at COP26. A final decision will only be reached in Glasgow and many hours of negotiations lie ahead. Striking a deal on the rules for a carbon market would be a major win for the summit, given that it looks increasingly unlikely the U.K. hosts will get the global commitment on phasing out coal they seek and some developing nations have been reluctant to raise their emissions-reduction targets without more financial support from rich countries . ""In all conversations with other delegations, we have clearly signaled that we are more flexible to make the agreement viable,"" Leonardo Cleaver de Athayde, Brazil's chief negotiator at COP26, said in an interview published in the Valor Economico newspaper on Oct. 21. Brazil's environment and foreign affairs ministries didn't immediately respond to questions. The U.K.'s COP unit declined to comment. The Glasgow gathering has been billed as a make-or-break summit to curb global warming, with the U.K. pushing hard for world leaders to raise their climate ambitions. COP26 President Alok Sharma has called on countries to keep alive the prospects of containing the global rise in temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels. An agreement on Article 6 would help countries achieve that goal. One of the main sticking points is whether to allow the use of credits generated under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. Brazil was one the top countries for emissions-reduction projects under the defunct Clean Development Mechanism, or CDM, and has in the past argued that all those credits should be allowed to make up for pollution cuts after 2020. But Brazil is now willing to find a compromise, said the people. Options on the table include allowing countries to use some credits created under the CDM to meet their earliest climate pledges, called Nationally Determined Contributions. Setting a cutoff date and limits on volumes of such credits could also be part of a potential solution, according to a U.N. document circulated among negotiators earlier this week. The paper was written by the chair of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice, and outlines possibles scenarios for a deal on Article 6. Another stumbling block has been disputes over potential double counting. In 2019, the EU said Brazil's plan would allow emissions savings to be counted twice. Brazil has long denied this, though it's now more willing to accept a middle-ground solution, the people said. That could include accepting the concept of double counting only for actions clearly stated in a country's NDC, or providing more time for countries to adapt by creating a period in which they would be exempt from such accounting rules, according to the SBSTA report. Proposed dates being considered include 2025 and 2030, according to the report dated Oct. 18. Still, it's likely that the EU will want more concessions. The bloc has repeatedly said that any agreement on Article 6 would have to guarantee its environmental integrity, and stressed that a bad deal would be worse than having no deal at all.

However, one curious Reddit user might’ve just spotted the prices for their upcoming Intel Arc GPUs thanks to Intel themselves. Intel had launched a ‘Xe HPG Scavenger Hunt’ website back in March of this year, as part of their marketing for their graphics division. As its name suggests, it’s a scavenger hunt of sorts where there’ll be 10 clues handed out by Intel and their partners, and participants will need to put it all together and submit an answer to stand a chance of winning their prizes. According to their terms and conditions, they’ll start releasing the clues from the end of October till the end of January next year. As part of the prize pool, Intel will send out one of their ‘premium’ Intel Arc graphics cards, some Intel Arc merch and a six month subscription for Xbox Game Pass for PC to 100 grand prize winners, with a stated total approximate retail value of USD900. Doing some quick math, six months of Xbox Game Pass for PC will be USD60, while the included merch could be anywhere from USD40 to USD60 at most, with the Intel Store listing an Intel Arc Jersey for USD53.65. This means that Intel’s top of the line Arc graphics card could be priced around the USD800 mark. Similarly, Intel will also be giving away the more ‘performance’ oriented Intel Arc graphics cards, Intel Arc merch and a three month subscription for Xbox Game Pass for PC to 200 1st place prize winners with a stated total retail value of USD700. Taking away the cost of the merch and Xbox Game Pass subscription, their performance graphics cards could be priced at around USD630. Unfortunately, if you were planning to join the Xe HPG Scavenger Hunt yourself, you’ll be disappointed to know that it’s not open to Malaysians at the moment. Nevertheless, it’s intriguing to see Intel perhaps unwittingly hinting at their retail pricing of their upcoming graphics cards. While these numbers do seem a little pricey right now, it should be pointed out that it’s still speculation for now, with no official word from Intel. Performance of their graphics cards also remain to be seen, though based on early leaks is expected to be between the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 and RTX 3080 for the highest tier premium GPU. According to Intel themselves, their Arc graphics cards ought to debut sometime in Q1 of 2022. If you can’t to get your hands on Intel’s graphics cards when they launch, you can check out more of what we know about them in the meantime such as Intel XeSS, Team Blue’s open source answer to NVIDIA’s own DLSS technology.

Dogecoin Has More Holders Than Bitcoin or Ether: Study,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/news/most-us-crypto-holders-own-dogecoin-popularity-survey-bitcoin-cardano-2587411,,,,"Dogecoin is fast becoming one of North America's favourite crypto assets after Bitcoin but it isn't as well received in all markets, especially in Asia.",,2021-10-25 12:14:09,"Dogecoin is the most popular memecoin around and although the cryptocurrency did begin as a joke back in 2013, its growth in the US — especially over the past year and a half — certainly isn't to be scoffed at. A recent study that was conducted across 22 countries by an Australian cryptocurrency survey agency, found Dogecoin's (DOGE) adoption rate in the US surpass that of Bitcoin and Ether — to a point where its adoption is almost twice as much as the global average. The agency in question, Finder, claims in its study that 30.6 percent of cryptocurrency owners in the US surveyed as part of the study, stated that they personally own Dogecoin . In sheer numbers, that is 1.6 times the global adoption level of 19.2 percent. The survey did, however, find that DOGE isn't as popular in Asia as Bitcoin , Ether , and Binance Coin. While more than three-quarters of the cryptocurrency holders own Bitcoin in Japan, Singaporean cryptocurrency holders prefer Ether. In Indonesia, though, digital assets holders prefer owning Binance Coin. But Dogecoin's rise in popularity isn't making headlines for the first time. Back in August, blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis confirmed that new investors are flocking to DOGE at levels that have not been seen in nearly four years. But a significant percentage of memecoin's supply remains in the hands of a few large holders, which shows that it's not as decentralised as some of the other crypto assets. Meanwhile, Cardano is another popular altcoin that witnesses mainstream adoption than some of the better-known crypto assets. According to the survey, Cardano enjoys the highest popularity in Australia. More than a quarter of the nation's adult cryptocurrency holders own the native crypto coin — ADA of the Cardano ecosystem. Based on a sample size of over 41,000 people across 22 countries, Finder's survey reveals that at least one in ten people have cryptocurrencies globally, showing that crypto adoption, is on the rise.

Choosing a course: What interests you the most?,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/choosing-a-course-what-interests-you-the-most-1.4702837?localLinksEnabled=false,,,,"After Christmas – and particularly coming into April – the demands of the Leaving Cert have a sneaky habit of creeping up on you, leaving you with a little less time for considering courses and career options. So, it makes sense to use your time wisely: open days are a good opportunity to find out as much as you possibly can about the courses that interest you. But how should you go about it? Once you’ve identified the courses that catch your eye, open days are usually structured to allow you to talk to tutors, lecturers and, ideally, other students on the course. Here’s some of the questions you should ask yourself – and them. 1 What do you like? “I start by sitting down with my students, asking them to look at the subjects they’re currently doing and what they enjoy the most,” says Betty McLaughlin, a former president of the Institute of Guidance Counsellors and a guidance counsellor in Mullingar, Co Westmeath. “If they’re doing six subjects and can pick two that they like, it can give them a steer as to what areas they may be interested in or have the aptitude for.” Of course, the subjects that students are taking in school may not directly correspond with a college course: there’s no sociology or psychology on the Leaving Cert curriculum, for instance, and while engineering is available as a Leaving Cert subject, a majority of students don’t sit the subject. “Take engineering or science as an example,” says McLaughlin. “You need to be a problem-solver, analytical and mathematical. If you’re doing honours maths and you’re good at it – perhaps alongside physics or chemistry – it could indicate that engineering or science is a good fit for you.” 2 What have you done? In March 2020, schools closed as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and this meant that students may have missed out on any work experience scheduled from mid-March onwards. That said, quite a few may have done work experience in the preceding months, and it may have given them an indication of what they are – and are not – interested in. 3 What might fit you? Psychometric interest tests are not the be-all and end-all, but they can give you a useful steer towards the areas that interest you. “There are useful psychometric interest tests available on Qualifax.ie,” says McLaughlin. “It can help you to understand if you’re geared more towards practical areas or whether you might prefer to work with people.” You’re not locked into the results of any of these tests: if the results absolutely jar with your instincts and gut feeling, they don’t have to be a deciding factor. 4 What if you’re not sure? A lucky few will already know the courses and career areas of most interest to them, but many won’t have a clue. This is where broad, general entry courses in areas such as arts, business, engineering or science can be useful, particularly if you’ve already identified the general area of study that might interest you. And, luckily, many third-levels offer broad, general entry routes to these areas, where students can sample a range of different subjects before deciding what to specialise in down the line. “I often try to gear students towards these general entry courses,” says McLaughlin. “They can get a broad taste of each module by the end of first or second year and it makes them better informed about what really interests them. But, that said, there are also specialised courses – such as politics with philosophy and economics, or genetics, or chemical engineering – that they can enter from first year, and some students will be sure from the outset that this is the right call for them.” 5 What are the modules like? This may be the single most important question a prospective student can ask themselves. Because, sure, the subject as a whole might seem interesting from a distance, but it’s only when you get up close and look at exactly what you’ll be studying that you can get a real feel for whether you’d enjoy it. A module is a self-contained unit of study within a programme. University College Dublin’s history programme, for instance, includes modules on Nazi Germany, Islam and Christianity in the middle ages, or as in UCD’s history course, Living Loving and Dying in 19th Century Ireland. At University of Limerick, the common entry biological and biological sciences course includes, in year one, modules on general chemistry, laboratory calculations and biology for biosciences, among others. “Go through the modules, be aware of what you will be studying and ask: will this excite me?” McLaughlin suggests. “Will I be sure I can do well in this course? Will it fulfil me?” 6 What commitment does it require? It’s a good idea to find out how many hours of “contact time” – the hours you’ll spend in lectures and tutorials – as well as the suggested amount of time you will have to study and work on assignments. “This is because you want to know how much is required of you and whether it will leave time for you to get involved in other aspects of college life, such as clubs and societies,” says McLaughlin. 7 Will I get the points and meet minimum requirements? “I always do a points forecast to help students get a sense of how they might do on their best day over their six best subjects,” says McLaughlin. “A lot of the students have a fair idea of what they are capable of, and [school exams and mocks] can help them. The CAO Change of Mind system is available until July 1st. You do need to be realistic about what you will get, and while your dream college might be, say, UCD, you might also be able to do the course in another college with fewer points.” While students have traditionally been able to get a rough idea of what points for any given course might be like, based on points in previous years, the huge surge in CAO points over the past two years – caused by grade inflation – make it difficult to know what points will be like in 2022. McLaughlin, however, says that there likely won’t be accredited grades in 2022 and that it is possible that the points in 2019 may be a better guide to possible CAO points next year. But nobody can be fully sure. 8 Is there work experience? A growing number of colleges and courses offer a semester or a year of paid work experience to students – experience which can be very helpful upon graduation. “This can also help the student to get into a company when they finish up,” says McLaughlin. “There may also be opportunities to study or work abroad. It’s definitely worth inquiring about this in relation to the courses that interest you.” 9 Why this college? While the course details should be critical to a student’s decision, don’t neglect whether the college – and town or city that it’s in – is the right place for you. Affordable student accommodation is in short supply and the Union of Students in Ireland, as well as individual lecturers and local students’ unions, have been highlighting stories of students commuting for four hours or more each day. For many students, the cost of living away from home is prohibitive and this means that they might want to look, if possible, at courses within a reasonable commutable distance. 10 Why this course? “Some courses are more or less the same wherever you do them,” McLaughlin says. “Nursing is monitored by [the regulatory body] the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland while the Teaching Council sets down what teachers need to know. This means that modules will be broadly similar. With this in mind, the differences may be around work experience or studying abroad.” It could also mean that, for some students and their families who are considering the family finances, it makes sense to study in a more local college. 11 What other entry routes exist? Go beyond the level-eight courses. Look at what’s available in level-seven courses and whether you can move from that level seven into a level eight. Post Leaving Cert (PLC) courses can also provide progression pathways into third-level. 12 Where will it take me? Although employers will increasingly take graduates from any discipline, McLaughlin advises students to see where graduates of the courses go on to work. This may be available online while college admission or careers offices will have tracked graduate destinations too.",,2021-10-26 00:00:00,"After Christmas – and particularly coming into April – the demands of the Leaving Cert have a sneaky habit of creeping up on you, leaving you with a little less time for considering courses and career options. So, it makes sense to use your time wisely: open days are a good opportunity to find out as much as you possibly can about the courses that interest you. But how should you go about it? Once you’ve identified the courses that catch your eye, open days are usually structured to allow you to talk to tutors, lecturers and, ideally, other students on the course. Here’s some of the questions you should ask yourself – and them. 1 What do you like? “I start by sitting down with my students, asking them to look at the subjects they’re currently doing and what they enjoy the most,” says Betty McLaughlin , a former president of the Institute of Guidance Counsellors and a guidance counsellor in Mullingar , Co Westmeath. “If they’re doing six subjects and can pick two that they like, it can give them a steer as to what areas they may be interested in or have the aptitude for.” Of course, the subjects that students are taking in school may not directly correspond with a college course: there’s no sociology or psychology on the Leaving Cert curriculum, for instance, and while engineering is available as a Leaving Cert subject, a majority of students don’t sit the subject. “Take engineering or science as an example,” says McLaughlin. “You need to be a problem-solver, analytical and mathematical. If you’re doing honours maths and you’re good at it – perhaps alongside physics or chemistry – it could indicate that engineering or science is a good fit for you.” 2 What have you done? In March 2020, schools closed as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and this meant that students may have missed out on any work experience scheduled from mid-March onwards. That said, quite a few may have done work experience in the preceding months, and it may have given them an indication of what they are – and are not – interested in. 3 What might fit you? Psychometric interest tests are not the be-all and end-all, but they can give you a useful steer towards the areas that interest you. “There are useful psychometric interest tests available on Qualifax.ie ,” says McLaughlin. “It can help you to understand if you’re geared more towards practical areas or whether you might prefer to work with people.” You’re not locked into the results of any of these tests: if the results absolutely jar with your instincts and gut feeling, they don’t have to be a deciding factor. 4 What if you’re not sure? A lucky few will already know the courses and career areas of most interest to them, but many won’t have a clue. This is where broad, general entry courses in areas such as arts, business, engineering or science can be useful, particularly if you’ve already identified the general area of study that might interest you. And, luckily, many third-levels offer broad, general entry routes to these areas, where students can sample a range of different subjects before deciding what to specialise in down the line. “I often try to gear students towards these general entry courses,” says McLaughlin. “They can get a broad taste of each module by the end of first or second year and it makes them better informed about what really interests them. But, that said, there are also specialised courses – such as politics with philosophy and economics, or genetics, or chemical engineering – that they can enter from first year, and some students will be sure from the outset that this is the right call for them.” 5 What are the modules like? This may be the single most important question a prospective student can ask themselves. Because, sure, the subject as a whole might seem interesting from a distance, but it’s only when you get up close and look at exactly what you’ll be studying that you can get a real feel for whether you’d enjoy it.

Vodafone's Rs 500 data plan outperforms Jio; Check out,https://www.thehansindia.com/technology/tech-news/vodafones-rs-500-data-plan-outperforms-jio-check-out-712416,"['Tech,Tech News']",['Kahekashan'],,"Both Vodafone and Jio offer a data plan that is priced at around Rs 500, offering special OTT services alongside the usual data benefits. Here's a quick look at both plans to see how they stack up in terms of value for money.","Vodafone's Rs 500 data plan outperforms JioVodafone's Rs 500 data plan outperforms JioThere's is tough competition between India's three main telecom operators, Vodafone Idea (Vi), Jio and Airtel, users are offered lucrative plans and services when they subscribe to prepaid and postpaid plans. With gigabytes of data being offered daily, many of these plans also offer access to specific OTT services, similar to how broadband services now offer bundled subscriptions these days.When it comes to streaming videos and other content, a proper data plan is required if WiFi is not available. Both Vodafone and Jio offer plans priced around Rs 500, offering users data and the ability to access their favourite streaming services. However, if users must choose between these two packages, it is important to understand the benefits that both operators offer. Vodafone prepaid Data Plan of Rs 500 Vodafone Idea has kept the competition with Jio strong with its Rs 499 prepaid data plan that comes with 3GB of data, unlimited calls, and 100 SMS every day. Vodafone prepaid data plan of Rs 500 is valid for 28 days. As a result, users get 84GB of data, which Vi expands to 100GB thanks to an additional 16GB of data. While this plan actually offers more data, the real benefit of subscribing to Vi's data plan is weekend data transfer and late-night binge deals, which users can take advantage of to increase their data usage further. of the package assignment. In terms of OTT services, Vi subscribers get access to Disney + Hotstar's mobile-only plan, which otherwise costs Rs 499 per year. Jio Prepaid Data Plan of Rs 499Jio's prepaid data plan that competes with Vi's offering is a data package that costs Rs 499 and is also valid for a period of 28 days. Users are offered 3GB of data every day, just like the other plan with unlimited calls and 100 SMS every day. With 3GB of data every day, users can access up to 84GB in a month, and Jio offers an additional 6GB, bringing the total to 90GB. This is still 10GB less than what Vi offers in its Rs 501 data package.In terms of OTT services, users will get access to the same Disney + Hotstar streaming plan for mobile, while also getting access to JioTV and JioCinema. The price of the plan was adjusted to accommodate the new Disney + Hotstar streaming plans. However, the Jio Rs 499 plan doesn't have the same data benefits (weekend transfer, more bingeing all night) as the Vi plan, putting it at a disadvantage compared to its competitor. It also offers less data (10GB less than Vi), which is worth keeping in mind when signing up for this plan.",2021-10-25 08:32:21,,https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2021/10/25/500x300_1118821-vijio.jpg,thehansindia

This free web tool is a fast and easy way to remove objects from images,https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744431/remove-edit-objects-images-photos-ai-free-cleanup-pictures,,['James Vincent'],,,"Ever needed to quickly edit something or someone out of an image? Maybe it’s the stranger who wandered into your family photo, or the stand holding up your final artwork for school? Whatever the job, if you don’t have the time or Photoshop skills needed to edit the thing yourself, why not try Cleanup.pictures — a handy web tool that does exactly what it promises in the URL. Just upload your picture, paint over the thing you want removed with the brush tool, and hey presto: new image. The results aren’t up to the standards of professionals, especially if the picture is particularly busy or complex, but they’re surprisingly good. The tool is also just quite fun to play around with. You can check out some examples in the gallery below: Cleanup.pictures seems to be from the same team that made a fun augmented reality demo that lets you “copy and paste” the real world, and is open-source (you can find the underlying code here). Obviously, tools of this sort have long been available, dating back at least to the launch of Photoshop’s Clone Stamp tool, but the quality of these automated programs has increased considerably in recent years thanks to AI. Machine learning systems are now not only better at the problem of segmentation (marking the divisions between an object and the background) but also inpainting, or filling in the new content. Just last week, Google launched its new Pixel 6 tools with an identical “Magic Eraser” feature, but Cleanup.pictures shows how this feature has become a commodity.

Dutch agency: Netherlands could face higher sea level rises,https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/science technology/dutch-agency-netherlands-could-face-higher-sea-level-rises-329469,,,,"The Hague, October 25 The Dutch climate experts warned Monday that the low-lying Netherlands could face higher sea level rises than previously forecast as well as the threat of extreme rainfall and other dangerous weather events caused by climate change. The Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, known by its Dutch acronym KNMI, issued the stark warning in a new update based on its own research and a report issued in August by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The Dutch report was presented less than a week before the UN's annual climate conference opens in Glasgow, Scotland. The October 31-November 12 event, known as COP26, is seen by many as an important and even crucial opportunity for concrete government commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. ""It might not be cheerful reading, but it is necessary reading,"" Dutch State Secretary for Infrastructure and Water Steven Weyenberg said. ""Talking about climate change as something we do for our children underestimates the urgency,"" he added. The KNMI said that if greenhouse gas emissions are not reduced, the sea level along the long Dutch coastline could rise by 1.2 meters (nearly 4 feet) by the year 2100. The institute warned in 2014 of a possible 1-meter rise. It said in Monday's update that if melting of the Antarctic ice cap accelerates, then sea levels could rise by 2 meters by 2100. The agency also warned of both heavier summer storms and droughts, with river levels expected to be lower in the summer and higher in the winter. The low-lying Netherlands is protected by thousands of kilometers (miles) of dikes along its rivers and its North Sea coast, and has a national Delta Fund that invests hundreds of millions each year in improvements and maintenance. Over the summer, torrential rainfall sparked widespread flooding in the southern province of Limburg. The same heavy summer storm caused dozens of deaths in neighboring Germany and Belgium. ""Adapting to extreme weather and anticipating sea level rises must be a top priority for a new government,"" Rogier van der Sande, chairman of the Dutch Union of Water Boards, said in a statement Monday. Four parties are currently negotiating to form the next Dutch ruling coalition, with climate measures one of the topics they are discussing. Weyenberg said it is clear more has to be done. ""The climate crisis is here. It's code red, and it is up to us all to act,"" he said. — AP",,2021-10-25 12:40:29,,https://englishtribuneimages.blob.core.windows.net/gallary-content/2021/10/2021_10$largeimg_2019581949.jpg,tribuneindia

Viviani is the only rider over 30 in the Italian track team and his success over the years, especially in the Omnium at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games, has helped create a successful Italian track programme by inspiring a new generation of riders that includes Filippo Ganna, Elisa Balsamo, Letizia Paternoster and, more recently, Jonathan Milan and Martina Fidanza.Fidanza started Italy’s medal haul by winning the women’s scratch race world title on the opening day of the 2021 Track World Championships.

The only bad news from the Roubaix Worlds was the theft of a number of track bikes, including the gold-painted men’s team pursuit bikes. Combined with Italy’s success in the European track and road championships and the road Worlds in Belgium, the Azzurri have won a total of 11 titles, taken six silver medals and five bronze medals in 2021. The men’s team pursuit squad won gold in Tokyo and on Sunday the Association of National Olympic Committees (ANOC) awarded them the prize of Best Male Multiple Athlete Event in Tokyo. ""This is the best-ever Italian track team,"" Viviani told La Gazzetta dello Sport. ""I’m proud to be the leader of the group of talented, young riders. We’ve never been this good. But now the bar has been raised higher and we can’t be happy with just the odd medal. The expectations are high and we’ll have to work even harder.""The Italian track team is now bullish for the 2024 Paris Olympics but is facing a staff shake-up as new Federation president Cordiano Dagnoni pushes through change among the national coaches. He has already appointed former Liquigas team manager Roberto Amadio as team manager, while Daniele Bennati is set to replace Davide Cassani as the selector of the men’s professional road team. Dino Salvoldi, the long-standing women's track and road coach is also to be replaced. Dagnoni will name his new coaches on November 2. Vivani is also facing change as he finally enjoys his off season. The sprinter from Verona will leave Cofidis for Ineos Grenadiers in 2022 in the hope of rediscovering at least some of the success he enjoyed during a rich spell with QuickStep between 2018 and 2019. He rode for Team Sky between 2015 and 2017 and will be allowed to again mix his road sprinting with track racing as he pursues other world titles. ""It’s not the Omnium title but the gold medal in the Elimination race is a perfect way to open my rainbow jersey account,"" Viviani told La Gazzetta dello Sport.""I was inspired by the team pursuiters, seeing them on the podium gave me extra motivation.

The only bad news from the Roubaix Worlds was the theft of a number of track bikes, including the gold-painted men’s team pursuit bikes. Combined with Italy’s success in the European track and road championships and the road Worlds in Belgium, the Azzurri have won a total of 11 titles, taken six silver medals and five bronze medals in 2021. The men’s team pursuit squad won gold in Tokyo and on Sunday the Association of National Olympic Committees (ANOC) awarded them the prize of Best Male Multiple Athlete Event in Tokyo. ""This is the best-ever Italian track team,"" Viviani told La Gazzetta dello Sport . ""I’m proud to be the leader of the group of talented, young riders. We’ve never been this good. But now the bar has been raised higher and we can’t be happy with just the odd medal. The expectations are high and we’ll have to work even harder."" The Italian track team is now bullish for the 2024 Paris Olympics but is facing a staff shake-up as new Federation president Cordiano Dagnoni pushes through change among the national coaches. He has already appointed former Liquigas team manager Roberto Amadio as team manager, while Daniele Bennati is set to replace Davide Cassani as the selector of the men’s professional road team. Dino Salvoldi, the long-standing women's track and road coach is also to be replaced. Dagnoni will name his new coaches on November 2. Vivani is also facing change as he finally enjoys his off season. The sprinter from Verona will leave Cofidis for Ineos Grenadiers in 2022 in the hope of rediscovering at least some of the success he enjoyed during a rich spell with QuickStep between 2018 and 2019. He rode for Team Sky between 2015 and 2017 and will be allowed to again mix his road sprinting with track racing as he pursues other world titles. ""It’s not the Omnium title but the gold medal in the Elimination race is a perfect way to open my rainbow jersey account,"" Viviani told La Gazzetta dello Sport . ""I was inspired by the team pursuiters, seeing them on the podium gave me extra motivation. I hope this is the first of many rainbow jerseys.""",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cJ2tBgWwuC3t9gNZimcBTP.jpg,cyclingnews

That was the question on my mind when I walked out to the parking lot to get into my car and it was not there. Given that Halloween was just a few days away, I naturally suspected that perhaps a ghost had decided to take my car for a spin. Seems like those ghosts don’t get much of a chance to spirit away an everyday car. I put aside the ghost theory and sought to find something more down-to-earth as an explanation for where my car was. This particular parking lot was quite expansive and there wasn’t any numbering system associated with the parking spots. Thus, I had to remember where my car was supposed to be as based entirely on my own mental “global positioning” brain ware, and absent of having any tangible and more reliable form of tracing. Relying on my noggin alone was not a sure bet. I was pretty sure that the parking spot of my car was next to a lamppost and about midway down a row of cars that was visually aligned with a sandwich shop outside of the fenced perimeter of the parking lot. That seems byzantine, I realize. Hey, at least it was a means to pin down generally where my car had to be. But my car was not where it was supposed to be. Indeed, it wasn’t anywhere near to where it was supposed to be. I stood in the presumed parking spot and looked all around me, stretching on my tippy toes and scanned the horizon like a sailor desperately trying to spy land ahoy. You might be thinking that I ought to remember what other cars were parked next to my car and thus I could just look for that pattern of say a red pickup truck and a yellow sportscar that were next to me. Unfortunately, this gambit wasn’t going to work out. I had parked my car very early in the morning that day, and it was now quite late in the evening. Most of the cars in this particular lot had turned over and a newer crop of cars had gradually entered into and parked here and there.

I routinely parked in this specific lot and had to jockey each day to discover an available empty space. As a result, each day my car was parked in some semi-randomly chosen spot such that I never knew beforehand where an open spot might exist. This all meant that I could readily be thinking about where I parked yesterday , rather than accurately remembering where I parked today. I decided that the brute force method of searching was required in this instance. I stridently walked up-and-down every row of the parking lot. This was done slowly and cautiously, wanting to make sure that I did not go hastily and inadvertently miss seeing my car. I assumed that by methodically searching, I would certainly find my car and the whole affair would be laughed off as a quirky moment of existence. If I were to sprint around in a panic, I figured it would only make me more panicky and I would be unlikely to detect my car, therefore end-up not finding it and shamefully enter into a mind-bending berserk mode accordingly. Well, the thoughtfully crafted brute force approach failed to unearth my car, which ostensibly meant that it was indeed missing. I was now begrudgingly convinced that my car was no longer in this parking lot. I knew absolutely that I had parked there. I knew absolutely that I was not somehow in the wrong parking lot. I knew for sure that I had not gotten a lift that morning or otherwise gotten to work by a method other than driving my car. Yes, the car was supposed to be here and it wasn’t, that was unnervingly the plain and agonizing truth. What did the heck happen to my car (I say that, minus the dude part, respectively)? I have already now covered the possibility that I had “misplaced” my car in terms of having thought it was in one spot and yet perhaps it was sitting quietly in another spot. So, misplacement was no longer on the list of possibilities. If my car wasn’t there, it must have been moved. I realize that seems blatantly obvious. Sorry, but that’s what goes through your mind when the shock of having a missing car strikes you to the bone. I liked my car. It was my favorite car of all the cars I’ve owned to date. Even if I didn’t somehow favor the car, nonetheless it was my car and it ought to be ready and waiting for me. Well, how could my car have been moved? One possibility that came to mind was that my car had been towed. Maybe my car was illegally parked while it was sitting in the parking lot. I have no idea how that could be, though perhaps some obscure parking rule had gotten my vehicle in trouble. Or perhaps my car had done something wrong, such as the horn suddenly squawking and nobody could stand the blaring sounds, so the parking lot management had my vehicle towed out of there. I summarily rejected the notion that aliens from another planet had beamed-up my car. That kind of thinking is fun when making a movie script or playing wild what-if games, but when your prized car is really gone, the practical ways of how it came to be missing are more valued and prudent to consider. There wasn’t an attendant in the parking lot. Near the exit gate, there was a payment kiosk and it had a red button to remotely make contact with someone associated with the parking aspects. I used the red button. Speaking to a human voice that emitted from a rather balky speaker, we determined that the parking establishment had not towed my car. Of course, someone else could have come into the parking lot and towed it, like one of the bounty hunter episodes. That fleeting thought was instantly rejected as being nearly equal to the alien invasion from Mars. Okay, it was now down to the remaining possibility that someone drove my car off the lot. I was the only person with a key to my car. If I had loaned out my spare key to someone else, they would immediately be a suspect in this budding crime scene. Those comedic shows where they pull a gag on someone can at times involve enlisting a friend of the unsuspecting dupe that then helps to drive off with their car, or subtly move it, sparking the person to be baffled at how their car was in a different spot than expected. This was inapplicable in my case. Anyway, it now seemed apparent that someone unknown to me had spirited away with my car. They must have devilishly gotten into my car and used one of those insidious under-the-dashboard sneaks to start my car and drive it away. Sadness ensued. I reported the matter to the police. They informed me that the odds were that my car was long gone by the time I had reported it missing. Having grown up watching TV shows that involve an all-points bulletin of citywide searches for a missing whatever, I was disappointed to discover that not only was such a street-by-street search not going to be undertaken, but there were also lots of other cars stolen on that day. In that sense, my stolen car was one of many and now was a statistic rather than something that had seemed very personal and personable to me. Shifting gears, the future of cars involves the emergence of self-driving cars. Here is today’s interesting question: Is it possible for an AI-based true self-driving car to go missing, and if so, what happens next? Let’s unpack the matter and see. Understanding The Levels Of Self-Driving Cars As a clarification, true self-driving cars are ones that the AI drives the car entirely on its own and there isn’t any human assistance during the driving task. These driverless vehicles are considered Level 4 and Level 5 (see my explanation at this link here ), while a car that requires a human driver to co-share the driving effort is usually considered at Level 2 or Level 3. The cars that co-share the driving task are described as being semi-autonomous, and typically contain a variety of automated add-on’s that are referred to as ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems). There is not yet a true self-driving car at Level 5, which we don’t yet even know if this will be possible to achieve, and nor how long it will take to get there. Meanwhile, the Level 4 efforts are gradually trying to get some traction by undergoing very narrow and selective public roadway trials, though there is controversy over whether this testing should be allowed per se (we are all life-or-death guinea pigs in an experiment taking place on our highways and byways, some contend, see my coverage at this link here ). Since semi-autonomous cars require a human driver, the adoption of those types of cars won’t be markedly different than driving conventional vehicles, so there’s not much new per se to cover about them on this topic (though, as you’ll see in a moment, the points next made are generally applicable). For semi-autonomous cars, it is important that the public needs to be forewarned about a disturbing aspect that’s been arising lately, namely that despite those human drivers that keep posting videos of themselves falling asleep at the wheel of a Level 2 or Level 3 car, we all need to avoid being misled into believing that the driver can take away their attention from the driving task while driving a semi-autonomous car. You are the responsible party for the driving actions of the vehicle, regardless of how much automation might be tossed into a Level 2 or Level 3. Self-Driving Cars And When They Go Missing For Level 4 and Level 5 true self-driving vehicles, there won’t be a human driver involved in the driving task. All occupants will be passengers. The AI is doing the driving. First, let’s dispense with the idea that the AI is somehow sentient. It is not. The AI of today is programmed and involves the same everyday kind of computers as found in your smartphone or laptop. To clarify, yes there are specialized computer processors that are built to aid in self-driving activities, such as chips that can process Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms rapidly, but those are still in the realm of conventional computing. I bring this up due to the interest in addressing the question about what happens if a self-driving car goes missing. We can reject outright the possibility that the AI of its own accord might drive the vehicle away from a particular place or parking spot. If the AI driving system drives the vehicle, it is because there is some everyday world reason for it. Thus, this does not include the AI as a sentient being that somehow decides today is the day it will go for a drive and showcase its freedom from the bonds of mankind (for my discussion about those kinds of futuristic and rather outsized notions, see the link here ). Let’s consider the reasonable possibilities for why a self-driving car might go missing. When my conventional car was missing, I initially assumed that I had “misplaced” my car. This meant that I was potentially confused about where I had last left my car. Perhaps I had parked it in place X and my mind was trying to convince me that I had parked it in place Y. The car was still sitting in place X and therefore was right where it was to start with. The alleged movement was only in my mind. Is it feasible for a self-driving car to get “misplaced” in the same manner as a conventional car? A fair answer to that question is that yes, it is conceivable. Suppose you owned a self-driving car and you parked it in the same parking lot as to where I work. You could readily do the same thing I did, namely coming back out later on and not be able to immediately find the self-driving car. In my case, it really was gone, but it was seemingly equally likely that I could have failed to remember accurately where it was parked. The beauty of a self-driving car is likely to be that it can be remotely activated and retrieved. A conventional car won’t drive itself to you. The best that most conventional cars can do is wink their headlights and toot their horn when you try to access them remotely. A true self-driving car would be able to properly and safely pull out of a parking spot and drive to wherever you might be standing and waiting for it to arrive (doing so entirely autonomously, and no human hand or guidance involved). In that sense, it is going to be very hard to misplace your self-driving car per se. No matter where your self-driving car was originally parked, it doesn’t especially matter, since it can find its way to you, assuming that it can be accessed remotely. I emphasize this remote access facet due to the off-chance that the electronic communications to your self-driving car are unable to function, perhaps being in a remote area or having some other form of communications networking issues. In that case, you would presumably have no means of alerting the self-driving car that it is needed and that it ought to startup and come to you. Likewise, if the self-driving car is out of battery charge and does not have the needed electrical energy to function, this also implies that you would not be able to remotely communicate with the vehicle. The proverbial dead battery is apt to make the self-driving car into a multi-ton paperweight, which of course could be said of any conventional car too. The point overall is that you could “misplace” a self-driving car, though finding it is altogether going to be relatively easy since you won’t search for it, and instead it will search for you (or, more likely, come to you). There is an added twist to this misplacement aspect. Since the self-driving car can drive itself, there is a chance that it might have opted to move from the parking spot that it was originally left in. With a conventional car, there is no chance that the car will opt to move (a human might do so, but not by the acts of the car alone). This suggests that if you did decide to walk out to find your self-driving car, it readily might not be in the original parked spot. The AI could have chosen to move the vehicle. Why would the AI do such a thing? Again, it is not as a result of sentience. Put aside any anthropomorphizing of today’s AI. The rational and easily explainable reason could be that the AI might have been programmed to detect adverse conditions while being parked. For example, suppose another car was backing into a spot that was head-to-head with the parked self-driving car. If the AI driving system was active, it might detect this danger, and start the car to move it away from getting dinged by the other car. The AI might then seek a different parking spot. In theory, the AI driving system would then send out an electronic message to indicate it had moved. The fleet operator or perhaps the owner would hopefully get dutifully notified. In any case, regardless of whether a notification was to occur, the notion is that the AI driving system can move the car, doing so for some programmatic reason. Indeed, it could be that the fleet operator opted to remotely activate the self-driving car, sending it to a local carwash. Unbeknownst to you, the AI driving system drove the self-driving car and left the parking lot, drove to a carwash, went through the carwash, perhaps refueled, and came back to the parking lot. All of that might take place without your awareness. That being said, this is somewhat farfetched in that if you owned the self-driving car, the odds are that the fleet operator would likely inform you of such actions. As an aside, some pundits reject wholescale the idea that individuals will own self-driving cars. The logic is that self-driving cars will only be owned in large fleets and by sizable companies, such as major automakers, major ridesharing firms, and the like. I am known for my contrarian stance that argues there will be individual ownership of self-driving cars (see my discussion at this link here ). I bring up this particular point because some would insist that you will never have a self-driving car and therefore never be able to “lose” a self-driving car (obviously, if you don’t have one, you can’t somehow lose it or misplace it). The future will consist of people always riding in self-driving cars on a ridesharing basis. A self-driving car will pick you up and take you to your destination. At no juncture will you care about where the self-driving car is parked. All that you know is that it appears when you need it, and it goes away when you don’t need it. For the moment, go with me on the perspective that people will be able to individually own a self-driving car. If you are agreeable to giving that notion some airtime, it means that we can continue the discussion about what happens when a self-driving car goes missing (which, as an aside, can be said to even apply when owned by a fleet, since the fleet owner could have similar concerns arise). Here’s where we are on this matter. A self-driving car that is parked can readily move from the parking spot. In contrast, a conventional car cannot readily be moved. It can be towed, of course. It can be driven by a human too. Each of those actions is somewhat harder to pull off than the same act of moving a self-driving car. With a self-driving car, there is an AI driving system in the car and ready to go, and for which can act somewhat on its own (perhaps pre-programmed to leave the parking lot at a particular time of day) or by remote activation. Could a self-driving car be towed? Yes, absolutely. We all need to realize that self-driving cars are in fact going to be towed from time to time. A self-driving car is still a car. Cars have various mechanical failures and breakdowns. An AI driving system cannot drive a car that is broken, any more than a human could drive such a vehicle. As such, you should not be surprised to witness self-driving cars getting towed to repair shops (see my coverage at this link here ). Could a human steal a self-driving car by breaking into the vehicle and driving it off? For a conventional car, a criminal can potentially break into a car, start the car, and drive it away. A quite natural question arises as to whether a human could do the same to a self-driving car. Well, eventually, the idea is that true self-driving cars won’t have any human-accessible driving controls. The thinking is that it will be best to prevent humans from driving cars since otherwise, they will continue to drive while drunk and drive while distracted. The hope is that by making self-driving cars only drivable by an AI driving system, we can reduce dramatically the number of car crashes and car-related fatalities and injuries. If that comes to pass, which not everyone agrees will necessarily happen, there won’t be any direct means for a car thief to drive away with a stolen car. They might be able to break into the self-driving car. They won’t have access to the driving controls. The odds are that self-driving cars will employ some form of Natural Language Processing (NLP) system for human riders to be able to tell the AI driving system where the person wants to go. In that case, presumably, the thief that has broken into a self-driving car could try to verbally instruct the AI driving system to spirit away with the car. This seems an unlikely scenario in that the odds are that NLP for AI driving systems will potentially use various security measures to make sure that the instructions being given are coming from the appropriate source. All told, the breaking into the vehicle is most certainly going to be detected by the AI driving system and that alone would setoff various alarms and alerts. A crook that then frantically tries to command the AI to drive away is bound to get nowhere. And, some predict that we will rarely have self-driving cars stolen at all. The sensors of the self-driving car will capture on video the car thief. The electronic communications of the self-driving car can instantly send out a message to the police and other authorities. Without any readily accessible driving controls, the thief cannot just hotwire the vehicle and drive away. Stealing a self-driving car also doesn’t make much sense for other various important reasons. For example, most self-driving cars will automatically be in touch with the fleet operator to indicate where the car is, what its status consists of, where it is going, etc. This is a vital form of traceability and monitoring by the fleet operator. A car thief would be tracked and generally unable to sneak away with the self-driving car (unless they could use some form of cybersecurity hacks to subvert or avoid the tracing, see my columns covering that looming prospect). Conclusion The good news is that stealing a self-driving car is going to be a tough crime to successfully commit. Even if a thief decided to steal a self-driving car via the act of towing (rather than driving off with the vehicle), the odds are that the towing action would readily be detected by the AI driving system and would emit automatically an electronic tipoff to the fleet operator that something has gone amiss. The somewhat unsettling news is that wherever you believe that you parked your self-driving car, there are lots of valid reasons why it might not be there anymore. At the same time, it won’t especially matter to you. You can park your car and forget where you parked it, doing so to your heart’s content. Almost akin to a beloved dog like Lassie, the AI driving system can come and find you when the time arises for you to need a ride. To clarify, the AI won’t be showering you with love and affection, and don’t expect those cherished canine slobbering kisses, since the self-driving car will only be doing what it was programmed to do. Perhaps someday we will have sentient AI, in which case the AI might be happy to see you, though the downside is that the AI might arbitrarily decide that it doesn’t want to give you a ride and will refuse to come and pick you up. We might need special Blade Runner -style bounty hunters that can wrangle those ornery AI driving systems that have decided purposely to go missing.",https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/0x0/filters%3Aformat%28jpg%29/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/616f63a78381218bc51e3a22/0x0.jpg?cropX1=104&cropX2=2024&cropY1=0&cropY2=1408,forbes

Ollie Barder Following on from the breakdown of the new Diaclone Big Powered GV toy, it seems only fitting to cover the flipside to that and feature the bad guys of Diaclone , the voracious Waruder . With Diaclone being the good guys back before Transformers was created, they needed the evil Waruder as an antagonist. So when Takara Tomy came to reboot the Diaclone toyline, the Waruder came along as well. Most of the new Waruder enemies are based around the Waruder Suits , which can combine in an almost infinite manner due to the modular nature of the suit itself. Inside each suit is a Warudaroid, these are the Waruder “pilots” but are actually closer to something like the Borg from Star Trek . This is because the Waruder don’t just destroy things, they actually want to capture and repurpose the Dia-Nauts . The Waruder are also somewhat hive minded, which is why the various Diaclone mecha have to be so multi-purpose to combat this threat.

Like the Diaclone mecha, the Warudaros is modular in terms of its assembly and has various forms. The two main modes though are a giant dinosaur like mecha and a humanoid mecha that is really rather massive. The build quality of the Warudaros is really very good, as the toy is nicely sturdy and very posable. Even across the various modes, the articulation is surprisingly thorough. The sculpt and detailing are also great throughout and really sell the whole insect inspiration from the Waruder, which brings me on to Transformers . As the Waruder were part of the old Diaclone range , they too became some of the original Transformers (along with a variety of Microman toys). In the case of the original Waruder , they became the Insecticons that were part of the Decepticon ranks. This insect-like design has since carried over to the newer Diaclone toys, with the Warudaros being a rather large example of that. The fact it also has a dinosaur mode also feeds into the decades long fascination with kaiju in Japan. So having the Diaclone forces face off against a mechanical monster feels very fitting. While these newer Diaclone toys do harken back to their 80s brethren, it’s very clear that these new toys are very much their own thing now. Yes, the Diaclone brand evokes a certain amount of nostalgia, but these new toys offer an awful lot more and are clearly aimed at an older demographic anyway. So if you’re curious about these new Diaclone toys from Takara Tomy, then places like HobbyLink Japan have some of the newer iterations in case you want to pick them up. Now if only Takara Tomy would make a Diaclone game.

The new 14-inch MacBook Pro is already $50 off at Amazon,https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/10/25/22744535/apple-macbook-pro-amazon-airpods-magsafe-google-pixel-6-buds-deal-sale,,['Cameron Faulkner'],,,"Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales Last week, Apple introduced its new generation of MacBook Pro laptops, featuring a new design (complete with a notched screen) and faster M1 chips. If you had your eye on the 14-inch model instead of the 16-inch MacBook Pro, you can save just a little bit of cash on it when you preorder at Amazon. The configuration that has the M1 Pro chip (eight-core CPU, 14-core GPU), 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD is $1,949.99 instead of $2,000. A $50 discount isn’t a whole lot, but it’s something. Verge editor-in-chief Nilay Patel just posted first impressions of his time with the latest MacBook Pro. It’s not a review (stay tuned for that), but check it out if you want to see some fresh images, along with takeaways from real-world usage of the M1 Pro and M1 Max chips. Another product that Apple recently debuted is discounted at Amazon. The new AirPods Pro that ship with a MagSafe charging case are $220 instead of Apple’s $249 price. In terms of features and specs, these are the same wireless earbuds that first shipped in 2019 — you can find those now for $197. It’s just the case that’s new here, and while we haven’t tested them yet (and thus, don’t know if the case has improved charging speeds or if it’s just magnetized), this is a decent deal I’d recommend for first-time AirPods Pro buyers who want everything they own to have MagSafe compatibility. If you’re interested in preordering a Google Pixel 6 or Pixel 6 Pro, Best Buy still has stock of the phones and is including a free set of Pixel Buds A-series wireless earbuds at checkout through Wednesday, October 27th. Those normally cost $100, so this is a solid incentive. Google unveiled the Pixel 6 phones last week, and the highlight was on the promising, new Google Tensor chip inside of both of them. Check out the video above for more details. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge While this isn’t technically a deal, it’s worth sharing that Microsoft’s Xbox Series S console is currently available at Best Buy for its normal $300 price. It was tough to find for several months following its debut in late 2020, and you may want to pick one up now if you planned to give it as a gift during the holidays. Supply of the console may dwindle as we get closer to Black Friday.",2021-10-25 13:36:23,,,theverge

Teachmint, one such startup that is helping teachers create their own virtual classrooms with a few taps on their smartphones, has raised $78 million in its Series B financing round, TechCrunch has learned and confirmed. Rocketship.vc and Vulcan Capital co-led the new round, the startup said on Monday. The new round values the 16-month-old Indian edtech firm at $500 million, according to two people familiar with the matter. Mihir Gupta, co-founder and chief executive of Teachmint, confirmed the size of the new funding round in a text message, but declined to comment on the valuation. Goodwater Capital and Epiq Capital as well as existing investors Learn Capital, CM Ventures, Lightspeed India and Better Capital also participated in the round, he said. The new investment comes months after the startup was approached by one of the two Indian edtech giants that offered the startup a $400 million acquisition price, according to three sources familiar with the matter. Teachmint declined the offer. The startup, which began its journey just weeks after the pandemic broke, is building what it calls the “ed-infra” for teachers in India to help them take online classes, engage with students virtually, assign them tasks, conduct attendance and also collect fees. This approach is different from edtech giants such as Byju’s, Unacademy, and Vedantu, where teachers directly don’t have a relationship with their students. And Teachmint’s model is working. The startup has amassed over 10 million users in the country, it said. “Since inception, we have been laser-focused on addressing the big technology-infrastructure gap that exists in education. Over the past 16 months, we have been humbled by the experience of powering the teaching and learning infrastructure for millions of teachers and students across India,” said Gupta. “From supporting individual teachers to powering K-12 schools, coaching institutes, colleges, universities and even EdTechs, we are disrupting technology penetration in education at an unprecedented pace. We are thrilled to welcome onboard Rocketship.vc and Vulcan Capital along with Goodwater Capital and Epiq Capital. We are also grateful to have the continuous support of our existing investors as we execute our vision at the global stage.” The startup said it will deploy the fresh capital to hire talent across product, technology, and design roles and will also soon offers its employees its biggest stock buyback option.

Leaked employee texts expose Zuckerberg,https://www.news.com.au/technology/online/social/history-will-not-judge-us-kindly-facebook-employees-rip-zuckerberg-in-leaked-messages/news-story/813b8dc5bd82ae0dcbb32fcede05b5e0,,,,"Facebook employees say Mark Zuckerberg’s obsession with growth has overridden ethical concerns and allowed hate speech and incitements to violence to spread unchecked, internal messages leaked to media outlets show.",,2021-10-25 21:39:00,"Facebook employees say Mark Zuckerberg’s obsession with growth has overridden ethical concerns and allowed hate speech and incitements to violence to spread unchecked, internal messages leaked to media outlets show. “History will not judge us kindly,” one staffer reportedly wrote on the day of the January 6 Capitol riots, which were organised partially through Facebook. “We’ve been fuelling this fire for a long time and we shouldn’t be surprised it’s now out of control,” wrote another Facebook staffer, according to the Atlantic. Facebook employees who had spent months raising concerns about the social media company’s engagement-obsessed algorithms pushing users toward extreme and conspiratorial content felt betrayed by a lack of action from the company, according to the report. In August 2020, one employee working on Facebook’s “integrity” team griped that any proposed design changes that would reduce users’ exposure to extreme content like the QAnon conspiracy theory had been consistently sidelined in favour of increasing user engagement. The employee accused the company of being “willing to act only after things had spiralled into a dire state,” according to the Atlantic. “Personally, during the time that we hesitated, I’ve seen folks from my hometown go further and further down the rabbithole of QAnon and Covid anti-mask/anti-vax conspiracy on FB,” the employee added. “It has been painful to observe.” Other Facebook employees, meanwhile, accused Zuckerberg of personally intervening to protect political figures who violated the company’s content moderation rules, according to the Financial Times. In one such case in 2019, Facebook moderators took down a video that falsely said that abortions are “never medically necessary”. After Republican politicians including Texas Senator Ted Cruz complained about the move, Zuckerberg was personally involved with Facebook’s decision to put the video back up, according to the outlet. Zuckerberg also allegedly gave into the Vietnam government’s censorship demands last year to avoid losing an estimated $1 billion in annual revenue from the country, insiders told the Washington Post. Ahead of an election in Vietnam last year, Zuckerberg personally decided to censor Facebook posts from anti-government pages because he argued going offline in the country would do more harm to free speech, the outlet said. Between July and December last year, Facebook took down more than 2200 posts by Vietnamese users — compared to just 834 in the first six months of 2020. Many Facebook employees also reportedly believe the company unfairly makes exceptions to its false news policy when dealing with certain publishers. Moves to remove “repeat offenders” from Facebook were dropped after being “influenced by input from Public Policy” an employee said in a December 2020 memo reported by the Financial Times, in reference to Facebook’s powerful Washington, DC-based arm led by former Bush administration staffer Joel Kaplan. In particular, Facebook gives special treatment to conservative publishers including Breitbart, Diamond and Silk, Charlie Kirk and PragerU, the employee said. Facebook did not immediately reply to requests for comment on the Atlantic and Financial Times reports. Company spokesman Joe Osborne told the Financial Times: “At the heart of these stories is a premise which is false. Yes, we’re a business and we make profit, but the idea that we do so at the expense of people’s safety or wellbeing misunderstands where our own commercial interests lie. The truth is we’ve invested $13bn and have over 40,000 people to do one job: keep people safe on Facebook.” Tuesday’s articles, which come on the same day Facebook is set to report third-quarter earnings, are part of a larger series of news stories based on documents leaked under embargo by whistleblower Frances Haugen. Other documents leaked by Haugen reportedly show that Facebook has allegedly misled investors and masked slowing growth among critical demographics like young users in the US, as well as failed to crack down on human trafficking on the site. Facebook shares were trading up 0.4 per cent at $325.75 (USD) on Tuesday — but have tanked more than 15 per cent since the beginning of September as Haugen has shared internal company documents with reporters and called on lawmakers to regulate the tech giant. — New York Post Children as young as 13 have been caught plotting horrific attacks on Australian soil over the internet.

Dairo Antonio Usuga, who headed the country’s largest narco-trafficking gang known as the Gulf Clan, was captured near one of his main outposts in Necocli, near the border with Panama. Images released by the government showed the 50-year-old Otoniel in handcuffs and surrounded by soldiers. “This is the hardest strike to drug trafficking in our country this century,” president Ivan Duque said in a message, adding that the arrest was “only comparable to the fall of Pablo Escobar,” the notorious Colombian narco-trafficking kingpin. Some 500 soldiers backed by 22 helicopters were deployed in the Necocli municipality to carry out the operation, which left one police officer dead. It was “the biggest penetration of the jungle ever seen in the military history of our country”, Duque said. A live broadcast by the police later showed a handcuffed Otoniel landing in Bogota before being taken into custody under heavy security. Colombia’s police chief Jorge Vargas said during a press conference that authorities carried out “an important satellite operation with agencies of the United States and the United Kingdom.” According to police, Otoniel was hiding in the jungle in the Uraba region, where he is from, and did not use a telephone, relying on couriers to communicate. Fearful of authorities, he “slept there in the rain, never approaching inhabited areas,” Vargas said. The United States had offered a $5 million bounty for information leading to the arrest of Otoniel, one of the most feared men in Colombia. He was indicted in the United States in 2009, and faces extradition proceedings to the country, where he would appear in the Southern District of New York federal court. The Colombian government blames the group — financed mainly through drug trafficking, illegal mining and extortion — for being one of the main drivers of the worst bout of nationwide violence since the signing of a peace pact with FARC guerillas in 2016. The Gulf Clan is present in almost 300 municipalities in the country, according to the independent think tank Indepaz. However, recent government efforts have seen the organisation decimated. Although Otoniel announced in 2017 he intended to reach an agreement to participate with the Colombian justice system, the government responded by deploying at least 1,000 soldiers to hunt him down. He took over the leadership of the Gulf Clan — previously known as the Usuga Clan — from his brother Juan de Dios, who was killed by police in 2012. Born to a poor family, Otoniel joined the Popular Liberation Army (EPL), a Marxist guerrilla group that demobilised in 1991. After laying down his arms, he later returned to fighting, joining far-right paramilitary groups. Many of these were demobilised in 2006 at the initiative of former right-wing president Alvaro Uribe’s administration, but Otoniel decided to remain in the fight. Colombia is the world’s top producer of cocaine, with the United States as its principal market, despite half a century of efforts to clamp down on the drug trade. In remote areas where there is little government presence, criminal groups like the Gulf Clan, dissident FARC guerillas and leftist ELN rebels fight bloody turf battles to control drug trafficking corridors and illegal mining operations. — AFP Footage showing an army veteran dealing with a would-be armed robber has gone viral after he swiftly dealt with the situation.

Tiny microscopic hunters could be a crystal ball for climate change,https://phys.org/news/2021-10-tiny-microscopic-hunters-crystal-ball.html,,,,It's hard to know what climate change will mean for Earth's interconnected and interdependent webs of life. But one team of researchers at Duke University says we might begin to get a glimpse of the future from just a few ounces of microbial soup.,,2021-10-25 17:03:17,"It's hard to know what climate change will mean for Earth's interconnected and interdependent webs of life. But one team of researchers at Duke University says we might begin to get a glimpse of the future from just a few ounces of microbial soup. Every drop of pond water and teaspoon of soil is teeming with tens of thousands of tiny unicellular creatures called protists. They're so abundant that they are estimated to weigh twice as much as all the animals on Earth combined. Neither animals nor plants nor fungi, the more than 200,000 known species of protists are often overlooked. But as temperatures warm, they could play a big role in buffering the effects of climate change , said Jean Philippe Gibert, an assistant professor of biology at Duke. That's because of what protists like to eat. They gobble up bacteria, which release carbon dioxide into the air when they respire, just like we do when we breathe out. But because bacteria account for more of the planet's biomass than any other living thing besides plants, they are among the largest natural emitters of carbon dioxide—the greenhouse gas most responsible for global warming . In a study published Oct. 19 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , Gibert, postdoctoral researcher Dan Wieczynski and colleagues tested the effects of warming on bacteria-eating protists by creating mini ecosystems—glass flasks each containing 10 different species of protists going about the business of eating and competing and reproducing. The flasks were kept at five temperatures ranging from 60 degrees to 95 degrees Fahrenheit. Two weeks later, the researchers looked to see which species had survived at each temperature and measured how much CO 2 they gave off during respiration. ""To me, the question was a simple one,"" Gibert said. ""Is there something to be measured on living organisms, today, that may allow us to predict their response to increasing temperature, tomorrow?"" The answer was yes. The researchers were surprised to find that each species' response to temperature could be predicted from just a few simple measurements of their size, shape and cell contents. And together, these factors in turn influenced respiration rates for the community as a whole. They also found that by taking measurements such as cell size and shape and plugging them into a mathematical model , they could get very close to how things played out in their mini ecosystems in reality. ""We can actually use what we know about the relationship between traits and temperature responses at the species level, and scale it all the way up to a whole ecosystem level,"" Wieczynski said. The work is important because it sheds light on ""how climate change will alter microbial communities and how this will feed back to influence the pace of climate change,"" Wieczynski said.

The A13 Bionic chipset, which is the same processor that powers the iPhone 11, is still fast and zippy. So, if you are into gaming, streaming video content, want a device for making presentations, or attending classes, this iPad will be a perfect fit. But the real highlight is the 12MP front camera that supports Center Stage, a new feature that uses the front-facing camera to track your face as you move around the frame. Sure, the entry-level iPad comes without a fully laminated display and lacks stereo speakers but that’s not a bummer. This iPad also supports the first-generation Apple Pencil and the Smart Keyboard. And yes, iPadOS will keep getting updates for 5 years, too. https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png Best for getting work done iPad Air 4 (2020) Price: Rs 54,900 onwards Although the iPad Air 4 was launched last year, it is still the most powerful tablet on the market. When lined up against the iPad Pros, the iPad Air 4 looks exactly like them but lacks a 120 Hz ProMotion display, a Face ID sensor (it includes a Touch ID embedded in the power button), and a LiDAR scanner. That being said, there’s a lot to like about the iPad Air. It’s got a 10.9-inch screen, fast A14 Bionic processor, slim edges around the display, a USB-C port and support for the second-gen Apple Pencil and the Magic Keyboard. You also get a pretty solid boost in battery life. The iPad Air 4 is mostly intended to get the work done, be it writing assignments, streaming Netflix, or playing games. It can be used by both students and working professionals. Read our review of iPad Air 4 . Best portable iPad iPad mini (2021) Price: Rs 46,900 The iPad mini isn’t designed to replace the iPhone or iPad Air. Instead, the iPad mini is a dedicated device that’s intended for portable gaming, jotting down notes, or reading eBooks. It has an audience who wish to have a smaller tablet with a nicer screen, a fast chip, better speakers and supports Apple Pencil. The newest iPad mini is essentially a miniature-sized iPad Pro with an 8.3-inch screen and slimmer bezels. It’s powered by the new Apple A15 Bionic chip, the same processor that powers the iPhone 13 series. The tablet also comes with an upgraded 12MP ultra-wide-angle lens with a 122-degree field of view, and that new lens enables a feature called Center Stage. Go for the iPad mini if you want a smaller tablet for things like reading, video calling, and gaming. Read our review of iPad mini 6 . Best tablet for serious work iPad Pro (11-inch, 12.9-inch, 2021) Price: iPad Pro 11-inch — Rs 71,900 onwards, iPad Pro 12.9-inch — Rs 99,900 onwards The iPad Pro is a premium tablet aimed at certain users who want the best Apple has to offer. The “pro” in the iPad Pro stands for “professional”, and it’s certainly that. Available in 11-inches and 12.9 inches, the iPad Pro is the top iPad in Apple’s line, the one with absolutely every feature available. The 12.9-inch model sports a new Mini-LED display — the same high-quality display as the latest 16-inch MacBook Pro. The iPad Pro has a USB Type-C port on the bottom, but it’s actually a Thunderbolt port. The premium iPad also supports the Magic Keyboard accessory as well as the second-generation Apple Pencil. These iPad Pro models are also the first to get the M1 chip that powers Apple’s MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro. Plus, iPadOS 15 makes the iPad Pro a versatile tablet. Not to forget, these iPad Pros are the only iPad to feature Face ID, a 120-Hz screen refresh rate for smoother scrolling, four speakers for better sound quality, and a lidar sensor for precise augmented reality.

AI voice-acting tool xVASynth gets even better at recreating videogame voices,https://www.pcgamer.com/ai-voice-acting-tool-xvasynth-gets-even-better-at-recreating-videogame-voices,,,,"Hear AI versions of Ron Perlman, Felicia Day, and Seth Green sing its praises.",,2021-10-25 06:55:06,"In January, Nat Clayton highlighted a neat tool for modders that was used to give a fan-made trailer entirely AI-synthesized voice acting . That tool is called xVASynth , and it's the work of software developer Dan Ruta, who just updated it to version 2.0. The video above demonstrates what's new with the help of some familiar voices, recreated by AI models trained on voice data to recreate a specific character. Not perfectly, of course—they have the clipped, hurried tone that gives away synthesized speech, as well as occasional mispronunciations—but good enough for mods. You'll hear characters like Cave Johnson from Portal 2, Elizabeth from BioShock Infinite, Butch from Fallout 3, Lady Dimitrescu from Resident Evil Village, and Widowmaker from Overwatch all extolling the improvements in xVASynth 2.0. Those improvements include support for installable pronunciation dictionaries via a community project called xVADict, which adds the unique words games are full of. There's also a 3D visualizer to make searching through hundred of AI models from dozens of games easier, clustering similar voices and letting you add filters to narrow them down. Audio quality has been improved, and an additional slider for energy control added alongside the existing sliders to modify the pitch and duration of individual lines. Plenty of Skyrim mods already use xVASynth, from Phenderix Magic World to Positive Undressed Reactions , and it also supports games like Cyberpunk 2077, Civilization 6, Dragon Age: Inquisition, and The Witcher 3.",,pcgamer

Russian hackers targeting US networks in ‘very large and ongoing’ cyberattack,https://nypost.com/2021/10/25/russian-hackers-target-us-networks-in-ongoing-cyberattack/,,['Emily Crane'],,Russian-linked hackers blamed for the massive cyberattack on the US last year have been targeting hundreds of companies and organizations in its latest wave of attacks on US-based computer networks.,Russian-linked hackers blamed for the massive cyberattack on the US last year have been targeting hundreds of companies and organizations in its latest wave of attacks on US-based computer networks.,2021-10-25 12:57:44,"Russian-linked hackers blamed for the massive cyberattack on the US last year have been targeting hundreds of companies and organizations in its latest wave of attacks on US-based computer networks — as the White House dismisses the incident as “unsophisticated, run-of-the mill operations.” In a blog post Sunday , Microsoft said Nobelium – the Russian-based agency behind last years’ widespread SolarWinds attack – has been targeting cloud service providers and technology service organizations in a bid to obtain data. The attacks have targeted organizations in the US and Europe since May, Microsoft said. One of Microsoft’s top security officers Tom Burt told the New York Times , which first reported the breach, that the latest attack was “very large and ongoing.” “Nobelium has been attempting to replicate the approach it has used in past attacks by targeting organizations integral to the global IT supply chain. This time, it is attacking a different part of the supply chain: resellers and other technology service providers that customize, deploy and manage cloud services and other technologies on behalf of their customers,” Microsoft said in its blog post. “We believe Nobelium ultimately hopes to piggyback on any direct access that resellers may have to their customers’ IT systems and more easily impersonate an organization’s trusted technology partner to gain access to their downstream customers.” Microsoft said it had notified 609 customers between July 1 and Oct. 19 they had been attacked. The company insisted only a small percent of the latest attempts were successful. “This recent activity is another indicator that Russia is trying to gain long-term, systematic access to a variety of points in the technology supply chain and establish a mechanism for surveilling – now or in the future – targets of interest to the Russian government,” Microsoft said. “The attacks we’ve observed in the recent campaign against resellers and service providers have not attempted to exploit any flaw or vulnerability in software but rather used well-known techniques, like password spray and phishing, to steal legitimate credentials and gain privileged access.” Microsoft said it had learned enough about these new attacks to provide information that “can be used to defend against this new approach.” A Biden administration official told the Times the latest attacks were “unsophisticated, run-of-the mill operations that could have been prevented if the cloud service providers had implemented baseline cybersecurity practices.” “We can do a lot of things… but the responsibility to implement simple cybersecurity practices to lock their — and by extension, our — digital doors rests with the private sector,” the official said. The US government blamed Russia for the major breach of government agencies last year known as the SolarWinds hack. President Biden hit Russia with sanctions back in April in the wake of the attack.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/russia-cybersurveillance-biden-preview-1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all,nypost

Eternals dreams big and falls hard,https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22741019/eternals-review-marvel,,['Joshua Rivera'],,,Image: Marvel Studios Confusing comics characters make for a very messy movie Continue reading…,2021-10-24 18:00:00,"Chloé Zhao’s 2020 film Nomadland begins with a few sparse lines of text that set up an entire world of loss. A sheetrock plant in the real-life town of Empire, Nevada, shuts down in January 2011. In six months’ time, Empire’s zip code is discontinued. It’s a ghost town. A stable-seeming environment is revealed to be constantly in flux, sometimes with frightening and destabilizing speed. Eternals , Zhao’s follow-up to her acclaimed Academy Award-winning film, also begins with explanatory text. This time however, it’s more lore than story, about beings from another planet brought to ours for a purpose the audience won’t fully grasp until the end of the film. It is withholding and not inviting, as if, from the very start, there are two forces at war for the kind of film Eternals should be. The latest film from Marvel Studios is equal parts puzzle piece and experiment. Eternals expands the frontiers of the MCU providing hints about what its future may hold while also being a project of formal ambition. Zhao deliberately breaks from the well-established Marvel formula to tell a more sweeping and mature story — the sort of story the filmmaker is known for. The script takes the sort of seismic shifts that can happen around us in six brief months and blows them up on a geologic scale across thousands of years, through the eyes of the most consciously diverse cast in a superhero blockbuster. Eternals , however, is ultimately haunted by that formula, continually yielding to the familiar whenever it tries to show us something new. Eternals is also saddled with one of the densest premises in Marvel Comics history, a relative anomaly in the large stable of memorable characters created by comics legend Jack Kirby. Even the considerably streamlined film version can’t lay the groundwork without heaps of exposition: The Eternals, the film’s opening text describes, are superhuman champions from a world called Olympia, dispatched to Earth by a cosmic god named Arimesh, a Celestial, in order to defend humankind from the monstrous Deviants. Throughout history, the Eternals have been here, helping humanity by fighting off Deviants and slowly providing technological advancement — to a certain point. Because the Eternals have another mandate: They cannot interfere in Earthly conflicts that don’t involve the Deviants. This is the reason the film gives — in an actual conversation, between characters — for The Eternals taking a raincheck on Thanos’ genocidal rampage or any of the horrors and atrocities of the past. It’s a bit hard to swallow, especially when the film goes to great special-effects lengths to depict historical moments of mass destruction. To the film’s credit, part of Eternals narrative arc is its characters wrestling with the morality of this mandate. The misfortune of putting this dilemma to characters who live for thousands of years is pretty simple: The longer the characters take to let awful stuff happen before they do something about it, the more they seem like chumps. In the present day, however, it’s pretty easy for the Eternals to follow this mandate. All of the Deviants on Earth have been wiped out, but instead of being offered a ticket to their home, Olympia, they’ve been effectively abandoned by their god and gone their separate ways, living in secret among the people of Earth. The exposition pauses and the action begins when Sersi (Gemma Chan) and Sprite (Lia McHugh), who live in London as a teacher and an (eternal) 12-year-old, respectively, are attacked by a not-so-extinct Deviant who also seems strong enough to kill Eternals. When the Superman-esque Ikaris (Richard Madden) arrives to help fend the Deviant off, a mini Eternals reunion becomes a full-blown road trip to get the family back together and figure out what’s going on with the Deviants. From here, Eternals becomes a hybrid travelogue and historical epic. As Sersi, Ikkaris, and Sprite reunite with their seven other “siblings” across the globe, the film flashes back to pivotal moments of their time on Earth, reflecting on their relationships with each other and humanity. They’re in Mesopotamia in 5000 B.C. kickstarting the Bronze Age; then they’re in Babylon in 575 B.C. seeding the wonders of the Hanging Gardens; then they’re in 1575 Mexico waching in shock as genocide Spanish colonists murder the people of Tenochtitlan. In cross cutting from one era to another, Zhao begins to emphasize place more than anything else — even action scenes seem to fade to take a backseat, a momentary interruption to the interpersonal drama of the Eternals as they question their role in the places around them. They fall in and out of love with each other, and humanity. They meet and are rebuffed by their god, Arishem the Celestial. They spend most of the film in doubt, unsure of what to do or believe. But Eternals is contemplative to a fault. Every time a new character is introduced, the ones we’ve previously met re-explain the story, and the same agreements and disagreements play out. In the best moments, Zhao allows the film to breathe around its most well-realized characters, like Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) who has settled into life as a Bollywood star and joins up because he wants to turn the adventure into a documentary about him saving the world with his ridiculously powerful finger guns. Less bombastic but equally compelling is Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), the Eternal inventor who, out of guilt for accelerating human technology to atomic war is possible, has retreated into a quiet domestic life with his human husband and son in the suburbs. The film’s cast is too big to give every character a fulfilling arc, but the film’s script by Zhao, Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo, and Kaz Firpo devotes most of the film’s runtime to its least compelling characters. Sersi, with her vague power to transmute inanimate matter from one form to another, most effectively shown off when she turns a speeding bus into rose petals, is the de facto protagonist, but also a listless one: She is torn between her life pretending to be mortal and dating her historian boyfriend Dane (Kit Harington) and her grander purpose, which she starts to question, but only when forced to. It’s almost like the Eternals take their vow of nonintervention so seriously that they also refuse to drive the film’s plot. Much has been made about what Chloé Zhao brings to the MCU as a filmmaker, largely stemming from Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige gushing over her insistence that Eternals be filmed on real locations , and not largely on green-screened soundstages, as many Marvel films are. The result is distinctive, but also strangely hollow. It’s as if, in order to accomodate the needs of a Marvel blockbuster, Eternals could only stage its action in the most barren of natural environments: A beach, a forest, a desert. Places big and open enough that a soundstage could be approximated, however begrudgingly. When it’s time for the naturalism of the film to give way to artificial action, the result is surprisingly demure — with one spectacular exception at the very end, Eternals’ action is quite small; a strange contrast to its grand scope. When the heroes “suit up” for their final fight, it almost feels wrong, or reluctant. The pat descriptors Marvel executives like Kevin Feige append to MCU films don’t hang so neatly on Eternals . Genre shorthand does a poor job of conveying what a viewer should expect. There are no heists, no spycraft, no strange new worlds nor hidden fantasy realms. Eternals is a meandering film about being estranged from your family, and how difficult it is to get the stones up to finally see them again. It’s two and a half hours full of people many thousands of years old going from place to place and talking about the good old days. After over a decade of the MCU formula’s dominance, it’s easy to mistake Eternals ’ deviance for profundity. Films that wrestle with difficult experiences can often be difficult to watch, and intentionally so. Unfortunately, Eternals isn’t bold, merely incongruous. The simpler explanation is truer: Eternals is a mess. It’s a movie concerned with conveying scale, about big ideas and forces that move on a geologic timetable beyond any one life. It wrestles with a morality that stretches beyond the considerations of one person or one planet, with purpose when time and distance have next to no meaning. The Marvel output bucks and protests under these conditions. The company’s plot-driven blockbusters are overwhelmingly concerned with the present, and to an arguably greater extent, what’s next. Eternals considers where we are, where we’ve been, and how much it’s changed us, if at all. These are largely internal ideas that are not easily translated to superhuman brawls in dim environs, where the beauty of the natural world is just a blank canvas for lasers and punching. Every fight is like a tether pulling Eternals back to the ground when it would rather fly. Each scene expounding on the cosmology of the MCU does more for movies we haven’t seen yet than it does for the one we’re watching. Movies can be big enough for ideas like this: difficult conversations of cosmic import with no clear answer, angry confrontations with an uncaring god, and whether or not our moral compass should shift as our perspective and reach grows. But a film must create a world where those questions matter, to its characters and to its audience. In a few short lines, Zhao did that with Nomadland . Eternals , however, just isn’t big enough. Or perhaps the Marvel Cinematic Universe is just too small. Eternals premieres in theaters on Friday, Nov. 5.",,polygon

On TechRadar, we've seen the film, and we'll publish our review of Eternals the closer we get to release – and we'll update this page as the critic average around the film solidifies. The thing is, Marvel needed to shake up the MCU on the big screen. Even if the numbers don't tell this story, Black Widow was such a rote film – a predictable solo flick that shed no real light on its lead and wasn't worth the pandemic-prolonged wait. The longer the MCU goes on, the more it's at risk of becoming formulaic. It sounds like Marvel's Eternals is the opposite of that, with its own distinctive visual style and its own dimension of lore that's designed to give the MCU more of an extended life. There was always a danger it wasn't going to land, but for once, no one can really accuse Marvel Studios of being risk-averse. Eternals releases on November 5 in the US and UK, and on November 4 in Australia.",,techradar
"Facebook whistleblower, Frances Haugen, raises trust and security questions over its e2e encryption",https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-raises-trust-and-security-questions-over-its-e2e-encryption/,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Europe', 'Policy', 'Privacy', 'Social', 'TC', 'ad tools', 'artificial intelligence', 'cryptography', 'e2e encryption', 'encryption', 'end-to-end encryption', 'ethiopia', 'Facebook', 'Frances Haugen', 'Messenger', 'online harms', 'Online Safety Bill', 'open source software', 'signal', 'social media', 'the telegraph', 'the wall street journal', 'UK government', 'UK parliament', 'United Kingdom', 'WhatsApp']",['Natasha Lomas'],,"Frances Haugen, one of (now) multiple Facebook whistleblowers who have come forward in recent years with damning testimony related to product safety, gave testimony in front of the UK parliament today — where, in one key moment, she was invited to clarify her views on end-to-end encryption following a report in the British newspaper the […]","Frances Haugen, one of (now) multiple Facebook whistleblowers who have come forward in recent years with damning testimony related to product safety, gave testimony in front of the UK parliament today — where, in one key moment, she was invited to clarify her views on end-to-end encryption following a report in the British newspaper the Telegraph yesterday. The report couched Facebook’s plan to extend its use of e2e encryption as “controversial” — aligning the newspaper’s choice of editorial spin with long-running UK government pressure on tech giants not to expand their use of strong encryption in order that platforms can be ordered to decrypt and hand over message content data on request. In its interview with Haugen, the Telegraph sought to link her very public concerns about Facebook’s overall lack of accountability to this UK government anti-e2ee agenda — claiming she had suggested Facebook’s use of e2e encryption could disrupt efforts to protect Uighur dissidents from Chinese state efforts to inject their devices with malware. The reported remarks were quickly seized upon by certain corners of the Internet (and at least one other ex-Facebook staffer who actually worked on adding e2e encryption to Messenger and is now self-styling as a ‘whistleblower’) — with concerns flying that her comments could be used to undermine e2e encryption generally and, therefore, the safety of scores of Internet users. Sounding unimpressed with the Telegraph’s spin, Haugen told UK lawmakers that her views on e2e encryption had been “misrepresented” — saying she fully supports “e2e open source encryption software”; and, indeed, that she uses it herself on a daily basis. What she said she had actually been querying was whether Facebook’s claim to be implementing e2e encryption can be trusted, given the tech giant does not allow for full external inspection of its code as is the case with fully open source e2ee alternatives. This is another reason why public oversight of the tech giant is essential, Haugen told the joint committee of the UK parliament which is scrutinizing (controversial) draft online safety legislation. “I want to be very, very clear. I was mischaracterised in the Telegraph yesterday on my opinions around end-to-end encryption,” she said. “I am a strong supporter of access to open source end to end encryption software. “I support access to end-to-end encryption and I use open source end-to-end encryption every day. My social support network is currently on an open source end-to-end encryption service.” “Part of why I am such an advocate for open source software in this case is that if you’re an activist, if you’re someone who has a sensitive need, a journalist, a whistleblower — my primary form of social software is an open source, end-to-end encryption chat platform,” she also said, without naming exactly which platform she uses for her own e2ee messaging (Signal seems likely — a not-for-profit rival to Facebook-owned WhatsApp which has benefited from millions of dollars of investment from WhatsApp founder Brian Action, another former Fb staffer turned critic; so maybe ‘meta’ would in fact be a perfect new brand name for Facebook). “But part of why that open source part is so important is you can see the code, anyone can go and look at it — and for the top open source end-to-end encryption platform those are some of the only ways you’re allowed to do chat in say the defence department in the US. “Facebook’s plan for end-to-end encryption — I think — is concerning because we have no idea what they’re doing to do. We don’t know what it means, we don’t if people’s privacy is actually protected. It’s super nuanced and it’s also a different context. On the open source end-to-end encryption product that I like to use there is no directory where you can find 14 year olds, there is no directory where you can go and find the Uighur community in Bangkok. On Facebook it is trivially easy to access vulnerable populations and there are national state actors that are doing this. “So I want to be clear, I am not against end-to-end encryption in Messenger but I do believe the public has a right to know what does that even mean? Are they really going to produce end-to-end encryption? Because if they say they’re doing end-to-end encryption and they don’t really do that people’s lives are in danger. And I personally don’t trust Facebook currently to tell the truth… I am concerned about them misconstruing the product that they’ve built — and they need regulatory oversight for that.” In additional remarks to the committee she further summarized her position by saying: “I am concerned on one side that the constellation of factors related to Facebook makes it even more necessary for public oversight of how they do encryption there — that’s things like access to the directory, those amplification settings. But the second one is just about security. If people think they’re using an end-to-end encryption product and Facebook’s interpretation of that is different than what, say, an open source product would do — because an open source product we can all look at it and make sure that what is says on the label is in the can. “But if Facebook claims they’ve built an end-to-end encryption thing and there’s really vulnerabilities people’s lives are on the line — and that’s what I’m concerned about. We need public oversight of anything Facebook does around end-to-end encryption because they are making people feel safe when they might be in danger.” Haugen, a former Facebook staffer from the civic integrity team, is the source for a tsunami of recent stories about Facebook’s business after she leaked thousands of pages of internal documents and research reports to the media, initially providing information to the Wall Street Journal, which published a slew of stories last month, including about the toxicity of Instagram for teens (aka the ‘Facebook Files‘), and subsequently releasing the data to a number of media outlets which have followed up with reports today on what they’re calling the Facebook Papers. The tl;dr of all these stories is Facebook prioritizes growth of its business over product safety — leading to a slew of harms that can affect individuals, other businesses and the public/society more generally whether as a result of inadequate AI systems that cannot properly identify and remove hate speech (leading to situations where its platform can whip up ethnic violence), or which allow engagement based ranking systems to routinely amplify extreme, radicalizing content without proper mind to risks (such as forming conspiracy-theory touting echo chambers forming around vulnerable individuals, isolating them from wider society), or overestimation of its ad reach leading to advertisers being systematically overcharged for its adtech. Internal Facebook documents highlight its moderation and misinformation issues During her testimony today, Haugen suggested Facebook’s AIs were unlikely to even be able to properly distinguish dialectal distinctions and nuances of meaning between UK English and US English — let alone the scores of languages in countries where it directs far less resource. Parliamentarians probed her on myriad harms during around 2.5 hours of testimony — and some of her answers repeated earlier testimony she gave to lawmakers in the US. Many of the UK committee’s questions asked for her view on what might be effective regulatory measures to close the accountability gap — both on Facebook and social media more generally — as MPs sought to identify profitable avenues for amending draft online safety legislation. “The danger with Facebook is not individuals saying bad things, it is about the systems of amplification that disproportionately give people saying extreme polarising things the largest megaphone in the room,” argued Haugen. Her list of suggestions for fixing a system of what she couched as broken incentives under Facebook’s current leadership included mandatory risk assessments — which she warned need to cover both product safety and organisational structure since she said much of the blame for Facebook’s problems lies with its “flat” organizational structure and a leadership team that rewards (and thus incentivizes) growth above all else, leaving no one internally who’s accountable for improving safety metrics. Such risk assessments would need to be carefully overseen by regulators to avoid Facebook using its customary tactic in the face of critical scrutiny of just marking its own homework — or “dancing with data” as she put it. Risk assessments should also involve the regulator “gathering from the community and saying are there other things that we should be concerned about”, she said, not just letting tech giants like Facebook define blinkered parameters for uselessly partial oversight — suggesting “a tandem approach like that that requires companies to articulate their solutions”. “I think that’s a flexible approach; I think that might work for quite a long time. But it has to be mandatory and there have to be certain quality bars because if Facebook can phone in it I guarantee you they’ll phone it in,” she also told the committee. Another recommendation Haugen had was for mandatory moderation of Facebook Groups when they exceed a certain number of users. Whereas — left unmoderated — she said groups can be easily misappropriated and/or misused (using techniques like ‘virality-hacking’) to act as an “amplification point” for spreading discord or disseminate disinformation, including by foreign information operations. “I strongly recommend that above a certain sized group they should be required to provide their own moderators and moderate every post,” she said. “This would naturally — in a content-agnostic way — regulate the impact of those large groups. Because if that group is actually valuable enough they will have no trouble recruiting volunteers.” Haugen also suggested that Facebook should be forced to make a firehose of information available to external researchers (as Twitter, for example, already does) — in a privacy-safe way — which would allow outside academics and experts to drive accountability from the outside by investigating potential issues and identifying concerns freed from Facebook’s internal growth-focused lens. Another of her recommendations was for regulators to demand segmented analysis from Facebook — so that oversight bodies get full transparency into populations that disproportionately experience harms on its platform. “The median experience on Facebook is a pretty good experience — the real danger is that 20% of the population has a horrible experience or an experience that is dangerous,” she suggested. She went on to argue that many of Facebook’s problems result from the sub-set of users who she said get “hyper exposed” to toxicity or to abuse — as a consequence of an engagement-driven design and growth-focused mindset that rejects even small tweaks to inject friction/reduce virality (and which she suggested would only mean Facebook giving up “small slivers” of growth in the short term and yield a much more pleasant and probably more profitable product over the longer term). “As we look at the harms of Facebook we need to think about these things as system problems — like the idea that these systems are designed products, these are intentional choices and that it’s often difficult to see the forest for the trees. That Facebook is a system of incentives, it’s full of good, kind, conscientious people who are working with bad incentives. And that there are lack of incentives inside the company to raise issues about flaws in the system and there’s lots of rewards for amplifying and making things grow more,” she told the committee. “So I think there is a big challenge of Facebook’s management philosophy is that they can just pick good metrics and then let people run free. And so they have found themselves in a trap where in a world like that how do you propose changing the metric? It’s very very hard because 1,000 people might have directed their labor for six months trying to move that metric and changing the metric will disrupt all of that work. “I don’t think any of it was intentional — I don’t think they set out to go down this path. And that’s why we need regulation — mandatory regulation, mandatory actions — to help pull them away from that spiral that they’re caught in.” Legislation that seeks to rein in online harms by applying regulations to platform giants like Facebook must also not focus only on individual harms — but needs to respond to societal harms, she also emphasized. “I think it is a grave danger to democracy and societies around the world to omit societal harm. A core part of why I came forward was I looked at the consequences of choices Facebook was making and I looked at things like the global south and I believe situations like Ethiopia are just part of the opening chapters of a novel that’s going to be horrific to read. We have to care about societal harm — not just for the global south but for our own societies. “When an oil spill happens it doesn’t make it harder for us to regulate oil companies. But right now Facebook is closing the door on us being able to act — we have a slight window of time to regain people-control over AI; we have to take advantage of this moment.” Facebook has been contacted for comment.

Kirsten Wild ends her career with two medals at Track Worlds,https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/kirsten-wild-ends-her-career-with-two-medals-at-track-worlds/,,['Jackie Tyson'],,'Beyond expectations' says Dutch rider about bidding farewell with bronze medal in Points race,"With multiple medals in hand, Kirsten Wild (Ceratizit-WNT) can now ride off into the sunset from competitive cycling. The Dutch sprinter completed her 17-year professional career at the UCI Track World Championships in Roubaix, France, with a bronze medal in her final event, the Points Race on Sunday.She earned a third consecutive rainbow jersey in the women’s Madison with Amy Pieters (SD Worx) over the weekend, bringing her haul of gold medals from the Worlds to 10. Wild is a three-time world champion in the Scratch race and Madison, and a two-time champion in the Points Race and Omnium events.“I think I've put together a decent list of honors both on the track and on the road,” the Dutch rider told Wielerflits after accepting her bronze medal in the Points race at Worlds on Sunday.“I look back on a very beautiful time. It was a great adventure and I would recommend it to anyone, if you can handle it physically and mentally.

A third place for Wild was better than she expected.“I had a difficult run-up. Let me say that this medal in the Points Race was also beyond expectations,” Wild said.“Lotte was very strong. A third place with such a strong opponent was the highest achievable. It was strange that it was my last laps. It was the last time I rode in orange. I enjoyed it – well, enjoyed it… I mostly suffered. I think it's nice that I finish on the podium after a very nice race.”She and Pieters have been the team to beat in the Madison for many years, so she was extremely disappointed the pair finished fourth in the first-ever Olympic Madison for women this summer, herself taken down in a crash in that event to fall out of medal contention. To end her track career with a gold in that event with Pieters was all the more special.“I'm really happy with what we did in the [Madison]. I am very proud that I was able to win there with Amy Pieters. Actually, I saw this as dessert. Of course you hope for everything, but I think a medal is very nice to end with.”Wild was one of many riders from Ceratizit-WNT who participated for their nations at the Tokyo Olympic Games, where she earned the bronze for the Netherlands in the Omnium on her third trip to the Games.“What a journey this has been. Started as a ‘bonus year’ and some time off, finished with a long year of struggling against myself. Got Covid-19 and a serious back injury. At that moment I couldn't imagine being on the Olympic podium,” she posted to social media in August.After the Olympic Games, the 38-year-old ended her road career at the Simac Ladies Tour, involved in a stage 3 crash and missing a final time to compete for a sprint victory.

A third place for Wild was better than she expected. “I had a difficult run-up. Let me say that this medal in the Points Race was also beyond expectations,” Wild said. “Lotte was very strong. A third place with such a strong opponent was the highest achievable. It was strange that it was my last laps. It was the last time I rode in orange. I enjoyed it – well, enjoyed it… I mostly suffered. I think it's nice that I finish on the podium after a very nice race.” She and Pieters have been the team to beat in the Madison for many years, so she was extremely disappointed the pair finished fourth in the first-ever Olympic Madison for women this summer, herself taken down in a crash in that event to fall out of medal contention. To end her track career with a gold in that event with Pieters was all the more special. “I'm really happy with what we did in the [Madison]. I am very proud that I was able to win there with Amy Pieters. Actually, I saw this as dessert. Of course you hope for everything, but I think a medal is very nice to end with.” Wild was one of many riders from Ceratizit-WNT who participated for their nations at the Tokyo Olympic Games, where she earned the bronze for the Netherlands in the Omnium on her third trip to the Games. “What a journey this has been. Started as a ‘bonus year’ and some time off, finished with a long year of struggling against myself. Got Covid-19 and a serious back injury. At that moment I couldn't imagine being on the Olympic podium,” she posted to social media in August. After the Olympic Games, the 38-year-old ended her road career at the Simac Ladies Tour, involved in a stage 3 crash and missing a final time to compete for a sprint victory. In her 17 years in the pro peloton, Wild amassed over 100 victories. Cycling energy products TORQ Organic Energy Bar -... Torq Organic Bar Amazon $33.75 View See all prices Science in Sport SiS Go...

The camera is capable of recording at up to 5.3K60, but the downside of this performance level is increased heat production that, in certain situations, may cause the camera to shut down unexpectedly. The GoPro HERO 10 Black firmware update, which is scheduled to launch by the end of the month, will introduce three new Video Performance Modes: Extended Battery, Tripod/Stationary Video, and Maximum Video Performance. The Tripod/Stationary Video mode is the one that will help reduce overheating and shutdown issues, doing so by optimizing the video resolution, frame rates, and video clip length for times when the camera lacks motion and airflow to keep it cool. The Extended Battery mode, meanwhile, optimizes the camera’s frame rate and resolution for max battery life and recording times. Finally, the new Maximum Video Performance mode maxes out the camera’s frame rates and resolution for top image quality. GoPro says the new Tripod/Stationary Video mode will extend the average video clip length at 5.3K60 by 47-percent to 29 minutes at 77F. The greatest clip length benefit is seen with the 4K60 video recording option, which has been increased by 154-percent to 63 minutes. This improvement is made possible, in part, by disabling HyperSmooth and GPS while in Tripod/Stationary Video mode. In addition to the firmware update, GoPro has also announced its new Enduro battery, which is designed to extend battery life and improve performance in cold temperatures. The Enduro battery can support recording 5.3K60 videos with an average length of 56 minutes when the battery itself has a temperature of 14F, according to GoPro. Users can also expect longer video recording lengths with Enduro when used in warmer, more typical environments. Enduro will be available for $24.99 USD starting on November 30.",,slashgear

Next-generation batteries could use material derived from trees,https://www.digitaltrends.com/news/solid-state-batteries-trees/,"['News', 'batteries', 'emerging technology', 'Wood']",['Georgina Torbet'],,"Researchers have developed a tree-derived material for use in solid state batteries, which are safer and less environmentally damaging than current batteries.",,2021-10-24 18:29:07,"A team of scientists has found a way to make use of an unusual material in next-generation batteries: Wood. The team from Brown University has developed a tree-derived material to be used in solid-state batteries, which are safer and less environmentally damaging than current batteries. Current generation lithium-ion batteries, like those used in phones, computers, and electronic vehicles, use volatile liquids as electrolytes. These electrolytes conduct lithium ions between the positive and negative electrodes of a battery. Liquid electrolytes do this job well, but they are toxic and can be dangerous. If the battery experiences a short circuit, for example, the liquid can combust and the battery can catch fire. This isn’t usually a problem in everyday use, but it has led to the recall of some batteries which have been incorrectly manufactured. To make batteries safer, researchers are developing solid-state batteries, in which a solid material is used as an electrolyte instead. A solid, non-flammable material would be safer to use and potentially less environmentally damaging to produce. Most of the current research into solid electrolytes has involved ceramics , which conduct ions very well but which are brittle and can easily crack or break. The Brown team has developed a material to be used as a solid electrolyte which is composed of a combination of copper and polymer tubes that are derived from wood and are called cellulose nanofibrils. The polymer material the researchers developed is extremely thin and flexible, like a sheet of paper, which makes it easier to use in manufacturing. Yet its ion conductivity is as good as thicker, more brittle materials like ceramics. “The lithium ions move in this organic solid electrolyte via mechanisms that we typically found in inorganic ceramics, enabling the record high ion conductivity,” said co-author Yue Qi, a professor at Brown’s School of Engineering, in a statement . “Using materials nature provides will reduce the overall impact of battery manufacture to our environment.” The researchers say they hope this development will help make solid-state batteries commonly available to improve safety in consumer electronics.

Researchers identify new threat to American chestnut trees,https://phys.org/news/2021-10-threat-american-chestnut-trees.html,,,,"For lumber companies, the American chestnut was a nearly perfect tree—tall, straight, rot-resistant and easy to split. It also was prolific, sending up new shoots that grew quickly.",,2021-10-25 20:05:41,"For lumber companies, the American chestnut was a nearly perfect tree—tall, straight, rot-resistant and easy to split. It also was prolific, sending up new shoots that grew quickly. In the early 1900s, the species made up a substantial portion of eastern hardwood forests. There were nearly four billion American chestnut trees in the United States, each growing up to 100 feet, with trunks four to seven feet thick. Healthy trees lived for 400 to 600 years, producing several bushels of nuts every year. Today, however, it can be difficult to find a healthy American chestnut. A fungal pathogen on trees imported from Japan and China wiped the species out in less than 40 years. That loss is considered to be the greatest ecological disaster to ever strike the world's forests. ""The pathogen is native to Chinese and Japanese chestnuts, so the two co-evolved,"" said Emily Dobry, a Penn State Behrend graduate now in Penn State's plant sciences horticulture master's-degree program. She is doing research work at the University's Lake Erie Regional Grape Research and Extension Center (LERGREC) in North East. ""The American chestnut had never been exposed to it before, however, so it had little natural resistance. Think of it as smallpox for trees."" Today, there are fewer than 1,000 American chestnut trees, largely in isolated areas outside of the tree's historical range in the eastern half of the United States, along the Appalachian mountain ridge and throughout New England. A few can be found at LERGREC, where researchers have been conducting a trial since 2013 with 15 chestnut trees—five each of the American, Chinese, and American-Chinese hybrid species developed by scientists, all planted in one long row. ""The idea was to plant American and Chinese chestnuts side by side with some of the hybrids that have been developed, and to allow them to be challenged with chestnut blight over the years,"" said Bryan Hed, a plant pathologist at LERGREC. ""Most of the trees have suffered dieback from disease, insects or weather and have had to be cut back and renewed,"" he said. ""The hybrid trees are notable exceptions: Three of them are currently 17 to 21 feet in height."" Trees are renewed using sucker growth from the original rootstock. ""The American chestnut is now designated as 'functionally extinct,'"" which means that although the species still technically survives, it cannot reproduce,"" Dobry said. ""The shoots rarely grow large enough to produce nuts, and therefore, future generations."" The most promising hope for the American chestnut now is probably transgenic—the development of a genetically modified tree. Scientists are trying to engineer a tree that is as close to an American chestnut as possible, with just enough genetic material from the Chinese chestnut to resist the blight. ""Researchers have developed partially blight-resistant transgenic American chestnuts that are capable of surviving infection from the pathogen that causes blight,"" Dobry said. ""It doesn't kill the pathogen; it's still present, but it doesn't destroy the tree."" The current balance of species in U.S. forests could pose another problem as scientists try to reintroduce the American chestnut: The oak tree has risen to fill its place. ""It will be a challenge for the American chestnut to establish itself into the forest ecosystem again, ""Dobry said. The American chestnut could bring other problems to the forest. In 2018, while working as an undergraduate researcher at LERGREC, Dobry discovered a fungus that was atypical for the American chestnut species. ""Initially, we assumed this was an unusual presentation of chestnut blight infection,"" she said, ""but after taking samples and doing research, we did not find blight , but a pathogen commonly known as chestnut brown rot. At the time, there had been no published report of this fungus in our hemisphere."" Dobry continues to study the domestically isolated strain, examining whether it may be harmful to species of trees closely related to the chestnut, such as oaks. ""If this fungus proves pathogenic to oak, it could be another blow to forest dynamics,"" she said. ""That's why the chestnut project and others like it are so important to protect the diversity and future of our forests.""

Climate scientists fear tipping points (maybe you should too),https://phys.org/news/2021-10-climate-scientists.html,,,,"Leaders may be going into the UN climate summit in Glasgow with the do-or-die goal of limiting global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius, but breaching that cap is not what keeps scientists awake at night.",,2021-10-25 08:15:26,"Leaders may be going into the UN climate summit in Glasgow with the do-or-die goal of limiting global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius, but breaching that cap is not what keeps scientists awake at night. The real disaster scenario begins with the triggering of invisible climate tripwires known as tipping points. ""Climate tipping points are a game-changing risk—an existential threat—and we need to do everything within our power to avoid them,"" said Tim Lenton, director of the Global Systems Institute at the University of Exeter. What's a tipping point? Anyone who has leaned back in a chair balancing on two legs knows there is a threshold beyond which you irrevocably crash to the floor. That portal between two stable states—in this case, an upright versus a fallen-over chair—is a tipping point, and Earth's complex, interlocking climate system is full of them. These temperature thresholds have potentially widespread impacts. If temperatures rise enough to melt the ice sheets atop Greenland and West Antarctica, it could lift oceans more than a dozen metres (40 feet). The Amazon tropical forest, upon which we depend to soak up carbon pollution, could turn into savannah. Or shallow subsoil known as permafrost—mostly in Siberia—tenuously holding twice the amount of greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere could see those harmful emissions seep into the air. ""We have seen a number of tipping points already in coral reefs and polar systems, and more are likely in the near term,"" the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said in a draft report on climate impacts, due out in February, obtained by AFP. In most cases, reversing the changes set in motion would be beyond the grasp of humanity for many generations, if not millennia. Why so scary? One of the first scientists to unlock the secret of tipping points recalled suddenly understanding some 15 years ago why they were so ominous. ""It was an 'Oh Shit!' moment,"" Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, founding director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), told AFP in an interview. ""Planetary machinery—the monsoon system, ocean circulation, the jet stream, the big ecosystems—abounds with non-linear systems,"" he said, referring to the potential for abrupt, dramatic change . ""That means you have so many points of no return."" In Antarctica, more than half the ice shelves that prevent glaciers—some larger in area than England and Scotland combined—from sliding into the ocean and lifting sea levels are at risk of crumbling due to climate change. ""It is like uncorking a bottle, and we are uncorking them one by one,"" said Schellnhuber. Earth-altering tipping points have different temperature thresholds. Scientists know these tripwires are there, but not exactly where they lie. Even more unsettling is how easily our already belaboured efforts to eliminate carbon pollution could be overwhelmed by the changes we are setting in motion. If thawing permafrost surrenders as much CO2 as humanity stops emitting, we find ourselves fighting a war on two fronts: on top of the struggle to slash our own emissions we'd have to cope with those generated by the planet itself. How many are there? Scientists count about 15 significant tipping points in the planet's climate system. Some are regional, others are global, all are interconnected. Those least resistant to global warming and closest to a point of no return are tropical coral reefs, the West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, alpine glaciers, Arctic summer sea ice and the Amazon forest. Parts of the climate system more resistant to rising temperatures include the global currents that redistribute heat through the oceans, the Arctic jet stream, the Indian monsoon, El Ninos in the Pacific, and desertification in the Sahel. While permafrost probably doesn't have a single temperature tripwire, the IPCC estimates it will release tens of billions of tonnes of CO2 for every extra degree of global warming. The last holdout would be East Antarctica's ice sheet, which holds 56 metres worth of sea-level rise. Why are we hearing about them now? The IPCC's most recent mega-report is the first to give tipping points more than a cursory mention. ""Abrupt responses and tipping points of the climate system... cannot be ruled out,"" the UN's climate science advisory body now warns. While scientists have long been aware of the danger that tipping points pose, part of the problem has been the inability of climate models—which are built to track gradual, linear change—to anticipate the timing or impact of abrupt shocks. ""Just because tipping points are challenging to predict doesn't mean they can be ignored,"" Lenton said. What is the ripple effect? A new wave of research is focusing on how sudden shifts triggered by tipping points ripple across the climate system, leading to possible chain reactions. Accelerating melt-off from the Greenland ice sheet , for example, is almost certainly slowing down the conveyor belt of ocean currents known as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). This, in turn, could push Earth's tropical rain belt southward and weaken the African and Asian monsoons, upon which hundreds of millions depend for rain-fed crops. Scientists cannot rule out the possibility that the AMOC will stall altogether, as it has in the past. If this happened, European winters would become much harsher and sea levels in the North Atlantic basin could rise substantially. There are dozens of other ways in which facets of the climate system are intertwined. What is a 'hothouse Earth'? Earth's past tells us that continuing greenhouse gas emissions ""could tip the global climate into a permanent hot state,"" according to the recent IPCC report. Think of it as the ultimate tipping point: ""hothouse Earth"". The last time atmospheric concentrations of CO2 matched today's levels, some three million years ago, temperatures were at least 3C more and sea levels five-to-25 metres higher. A combination of more carbon pollution and emissions from permafrost and dying forests ""might set us on such a trajectory in little more than a century,"" said Jan Zalasiewicz, a palaeo-biology professor at the University of Leicester. Johan Rockstrom, PIK director, said a 2C cap on warming was ""not a social or economic choice, it is actually a planetary boundary"". ""The moment that the Earth system flips over from being self-cooling—which it still is—to self-warming, that is the moment that we lose control,"" he told AFP. What are economic risks? Tipping points are not currently taken into account when assessing the economic risks associated with climate change—but experts argue that they should be. New York University economist Gernot Wagner earlier this year calculated the potential cost to society of major planetary tipping points. Once Earth's potential for nasty surprises is taken into account, the dollar damage to health and the environment caused by each ton of CO2 emitted today—known as the social cost of carbon—would increase by at least a quarter, he found. In other words, the greater the risk, the higher the cost. Any silver linings? But there is potential for positive change too. Just like social momentum helped to spur rapid transitions—the ending of slavery, the dismantling apartheid in South Africa, or the push to legalise gay marriage in the US, for example—so it might be with climate change. From electric vehicles and green investments, to a global youth movement led by Greta Thunberg, a crescendo of change has experts wondering whether the world is turning the corner on climate.

With the stacking of the rocket complete, it’s ready to be transferred to the launchpad for its long-anticipated trip into orbit. Along with the completion of stacking the rocket, NASA has also now confirmed a potential launch date for the uncrewed Artemis I mission. NASA is currently targeting liftoff for February 2022. However, before the launch can happen, NASA does have to go through a series of integrated tests to complete the checkout for the system. While there is still some testing to go, NASA Exploration Ground Systems program manager Mike Bolger says the completion of stacking Orion atop the SLS rocket is a significant milestone. Several test campaigns must be completed between now and that potential February launch date. One of the campaigns is Interface Verification Testing, designed to verify the functionality and interoperability of the interface across all elements of the rocket and the Orion capsule. Another test campaign is Program Specific Engineering Testing to ensure various systems aboard the rocket and capsule function as intended. NASA also has to conduct End-to-end Communications Testing, a testing program for the integrated radio frequencies between mission control to the SLS, ICPS, and Orion. Those communications are critical to ensuring communications between the rocket during the first few seconds of launch and as it travels into orbit. One of the most critical test campaigns for the rocket is the Wet Dress Rehearsal. During that test campaign, the cryogenic fuels will be loaded into the rocket as it prepares for simulated launch. For this test, the spacecraft and rocket will be rolled to the launchpad to be prepared for fuel and various checkouts. During that test program, mission controllers will run a simulated launch that stops before the engines would fire during the real launch.",,slashgear

How to earn new cards in Back 4 Blood,https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/back-4-blood-how-to-earn-new-cards/,"['Gaming', 'Back 4 Blood', 'Back 4 Blood tips', 'co-op games', 'first person shooter', 'zombie games']",['Jesse Lennox'],,"Not all the cards are created equal, and you'll want as many as possible to build the ideal deck. Here are all the ways you can earn new cards in Back 4 Blood.",,2021-10-24 15:50:19,"In all the important ways, Back 4 Blood is the co-op zombie shooter that fans have been waiting for since Left 4 Dead 2. It has a few minor tweaks to the gameplay here and there, many improvements to gameplay and progression, and the obvious technical and graphical upgrades that the new generation of hardware affords. If you’ve sunk dozens, or more likely hundreds, of hours into those old classic zombie survival adventures, then Back 4 Blood will be a welcome breath of fresh air in a space that really hasn’t had any comparable games. Of all the changes this game has, though, the biggest is clearly the card system. Cards are modifiers that add another layer of unpredictability to every campaign mission you run. The new A.I. director will still be there to tweak the difficulty, spawning Ridden and items based on how your team is doing to always keep things tense, but cards are on a different level. You will build your own deck to give yourself various buffs and advantages to keep up with the increasing difficulty of the missions. Not all cards are created equal, and you’ll want as many as possible to build the ideal deck. Here are all the ways you can earn new cards in Back 4 Blood. Further reading A beginner’s guide to Back 4 Blood: How to fight back against the horde Back 4 Blood’s card system explained Is Back 4 Blood cross-platform? Complete Accomplishments The first way to get cards in Back 4 Blood is slower and less reliable than the second. You will probably end up just getting some of these cards through natural progression, but some you will have to go out of your way for. And you’ll want to, too, because the cards you get this way are rare and can’t be obtained any other way. Accomplishments are tasks you can do while playing matches. Some are more simple, like getting a number of kills with different weapon types, while others are more like achievements or trophies where you need to do something more specific like complete the Bar Room Blitz mission while making sure the jukebox doesn’t break. For the most part, you’re better off leaving these cards to hunt until later on, or if you see one you really want to get early since a lot will come just by playing normally. Spend Supply Points on Supply Lines Your main source of cards is meant to come from the Supply Lines. You will earn Supply Points by playing and beating missions that you can take to Chenda in the Fort Hope hub zone. You start off with just one Supply Line to show you how it works, but once you complete it, more will open up. These look and act a little like battle passes. You invest your points and unlock a set series of rewards until the line is complete. Thankfully you can see exactly what all the rewards are going to be, including any cards, so you can decide which Supply Lines you want to dump your points into. You will be forced to unlock some other items, like cosmetics, in these Supply Lines as well, but you at least always know what you’re going to get and when, and outside of the cards tied to Accomplishments this is where every card will become available. Test cards out in Solo Finally, while you can’t keep them, you can at least test out any card in the game before you’ve even unlocked it. If you look in your Deck menu and go into the Solo section, you can access every card in the game to build a deck with. This deck can only be used in Solo mode, naturally, where nothing can be unlocked or earned. That makes it a perfect testing ground you can use if you see a card you think would be good to go for but want to make sure before attempting that Accomplishment or spending your Supply Points — feel free to test it out in Solo mode to make sure.

However, the NASA Starlight program points a path forward to send small, relativistic spacecraft far outside our solar system via standoff directed-energy propulsion. These miniaturized spacecraft are capable of robotic exploration but can also transport seeds and organisms, marking a profound change in our ability to both characterize and expand the reach of known life. Here we explore the biological and technological challenges of interstellar space biology, focusing on radiation-tolerant microorganisms capable of cryptobiosis. Additionally, we discuss planetary protection concerns and other ethical considerations of sending life to the stars. Directed Energy Propulsion of a Light Sail. (a) A light sail and payload propelled into interstellar space by directed energy laser propulsion. Emitted photons from a standoff laser array on the surface of the Earth (space-based laser arrays are also possible) impart momentum on the sail by reflection so as to accelerate the spacecraft up to relativistic speeds. Artist's rendition. (b) The laser array is composed of many small, modular sub-elements which can be articulated, switched off, and added so as to enable a large mission space. As the capability of directed energy propulsion grows, relativistic flight will become possible. Stephen Lantin, Sophie Mendell, Ghassan Akkad, Alexander N.

The file in question is an “Apple Watch Pro” logo that never saw the light of day. The demo unit that this file was discovered on was the original design that had a built-in iPad mini for walking a customer through watchOS. The “Apple Watch Pro” logo was discovered alongside logos for the Apple Watch Sport and Apple Watch Edition, leaving us to speculate that Apple at one point planned to call the mid-tier stainless steel watches “Apple Watch Pro.” The file appears to have been created on February 26, 2015 – just a few weeks before Apple held its “Spring Forward” event to reveal pricing and the release date for the watch. This particular Apple Watch demo unit didn’t allow customers to try the watch on their own wrist, rather it was mounted to a white case that sat atop Apple Store tables. The iPad mini display that sat to the side of the watch displayed information about the current app you were looking at on the Apple Watch. Upon looking into some of the demo content files on a 2015 Apple Watch Demo (A1623), I discovered an image of logo for an unknown model of Apple Watch.

But how do earthquakes occur, and when have been the strongest ones recorded? GettyEarthquakes are caused by plate movements in the earth’s crust[/caption] What causes earthquakes? The earth’s crust is made up of different pieces known as tectonic plates. These plates fit together like a jigsaw and continuously move at a rate of a few centimetres a year, in different directions and at different speeds. It’s common for plates to slides past each other, bump into each other and move away from each other. As plates carry on moving in different directions over long periods of time, friction causes energy to build up. Eventually it becomes so great that the energy is released, which creates a shock wave – an earthquake. If the earthquake is beneath the ocean it can create a series of huge waves, called a tsunami.

Others can be powerful enough to damage and destroy towns and cities. The size of such earthquakes would be measured on the Richter magnitude scale. There are earthquakes in the UK, but they are rare and so small that most people do not feel them. What have been the strongest ever earthquakes? 5. Kamchatka, Russia Earthquake (1952) On November 4, 1952, at 16:58 GMT (04:58 local time) a huge earthquake struck off the coast of Kamchatka Peninsula, in the far east of Russia. Measuring 9.0 on the Richter scale, it produced a great destructive Pacific-wide tsunami with waves up to 15 meters – causing extensive damage to the Kamchatka Peninsula and the Kuril Islands. The earthquake approximately left 10,000-15,000 people dead. 4. Tōhoku Earthquake (2011) On March 11, 2011, at 14:46 GMT (05:46 local time), a massive undersea earthquake off the coast of Japan occurred. The 9.1 earthquake triggered a tsunami – producing waves up to 40.5 meters high. The waves traveled inland as far as 6 miles and caused extensive and severe structural damage in north-eastern Japan.  On March 10, 2015, it was announced that the confirmed casualties were 15,894 deaths, 6,152 injured, and 2,562 people missing. 3. Sumatra Earthquake (2004) GettyElephants pull debris January 6, 2005 to clear an area destroyed by the tsunami in Indonesia[/caption] On Boxing Day 2004, one of the deadliest natural disasters in recent history occurred. The 2004 Sumatra Earthquake, also known as the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, ruptured off the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia. It created the greatest fault length of any recorded earthquake – spanning a distance of 1500km, had the longest duration of faulting ever observed – between 8.3 and 10 minutes, and produced a tsunami with waves 30m high. It caused the entire planet to vibrate as much as 1cm and caused up to a quarter of a million deaths. 2. Great Alaska Earthquake (1964) The Great Alaska earthquake was the most powerful recorded earthquake in US history The 1964 Great Alaska earthquake, also known as Good Friday earthquake, occurred at 17:36 local time (01:36 GMT the following day) on Good Friday, March 27 in the Prince William Sound region of Alaska. It lasted approximately 4.5 minutes and is the most powerful recorded earthquake in US history. The 9.2 earthquake triggered tsunamis felt in Alaska, Oregon and California. A total of 139 people are believed to have died – 15 as a result of the earthquake itself. 1. Valdivia Earthquake (1960) GettyThe earthquake in Chile in 1960 was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded[/caption] Also known as the Great Chilean earthquake, it was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded measuring 9.5 on the Richter scale. The earthquake hit on May 22, at 19:11 GMT (15:11 local time), approximately 100 miles off the coast of Chile – parallel to the city of Valdivia.  It lasted approximately 10 minutes and triggered a massive tsunami with waves up to 25m.

"Sony's Xperia Pro-I is a $1,800 phone with a 1-inch camera sensor",https://www.engadget.com/sony-xperia-pro-i-announcement-031222484.html?src=rss,"['Consumer Discretionary', 'Cameras & Photography', 'Technology & Electronics', 'site|engadget', 'provider_name|Engadget', 'region|US', 'language|en-US', 'author_name|Igor Bonifacic']",,,"At the start of 2021, Sony introduced the $2,500 Xperia Pro. It was a phone the company made for video professionals. Now, Sony is back with a second professional-grade smartphone designed to appeal to photography enthusiasts. The headline feature of the Xperia Pro-I is a 1-inch sensor borrowed from the company's RX100 VII point-and-shoot camera. That's a much larger sensor than you'll find on most phones. To put things in perspective, the primary sensor on the Pixel 6 Pro features a pixel pitch of 1.2µm. By contrast, the main sensor on the Pro-I has 2.4µm-sized pixels, making it much better in low light. It can also shoot 12-bit RAW files and native 4K video at 120 frames per second with eye-detection auto-focus. Speaking of auto-focus, it comes with 315 points that cover 90 percent of the frame.The Pro-I also includes one of Sony's BIONZ X imaging processors, giving it the ability to shoot up to 20 frames per second with both auto-focus and auto-exposure enabled. The fast readout speed of the sensor allows it to avoid a rolling shutter effect, a feature Sony says helps the Pro-I stand out from other phones with 1-inch sensors like the Mi 11 Ultra. Those handsets also don't have phase-detection autofocus like the Pro-I does.Complimenting the 1-inch sensor is a 24mm lens made from glass that can switch between f/2.0 and f/4.0 apertures. Sony went with an aspherical design to make the optics as small as possible. Flanking the primary camera is a 16mm ultrawide camera and a 50mm telephoto camera. Sony says it chose that lens arrangement after consulting with photographers who told the company they wanted a setup that matched their collection of prime lenses.Once you get past its camera, the Xperia Pro-I is essentially a souped-up Xperia 1 III. Internally, the phone features a Snapdragon 888 supported by 12GB of RAM and 512GB of internal storage. You can add up to 1TB of additional storage with the help of a microSD card. Powering everything is a 4,500mAh battery Sony claims will allow you to use the Pro-I for a full day on a single charge. Inside the box is a 30W power adapter that can charge the phone to 50 percent in 30 minutes.The Pro-I also features the same 6.5-inch OLED that came on the Xperia 1 III. It's a 4K display with a 120Hz refresh rate and 21:9 aspect ratio. On the audio front, the Pro-I not only comes with a 3.5mm headphone jack, but it also includes Sony's LDAC and DSEE technologies.All of those capabilities come with a hefty price tag. In the US, Sony plans to sell the Xperia Pro-I for the eye-watering price of $1,800. The way the company sees it, you're effectively getting a flagship phone and RX100 VII for less than the price of buying those devices separately. However, the Xperia Pro-I isn't a one-to-one replacement for the RX100 VII. Sony's point-and-camera outputs images at 20.1-megapixel, using the full readout from its sensor. The Pro-I uses a crop because taking advantage of the entire sensor would necessitate a much larger lens than would be feasible to include on a smartphone. Pre-orders for the Xperia Pro-I open on October 28th, with general availability to follow in December.  ",,2021-10-26 03:12:22,,,engadget

These come with a greater core count and enhanced graphics performance. The ports on the MacBook Pro through the years have been a letdown, which Apple has taken note of and has included more variety of ports this time. It now comes with an HDMI, Thunderbolt 4, SD card slot and supports MagSafe charging. Arguably, with the given features, the MacBook Pro 14-inch is perhaps the best handy laptop on the market right now but the $2,000 tag – it starts at – is not for everyone to digest. If you’re in the market for the best option for browsing, productivity and some gaming, there are many Windows laptops you can explore. When choosing the best laptop from the others, a good blend of portability, power and efficiency is a must. But in addition to these, the price is also a point of contention for many users. Comprising a blend of it all, below are some laptops with better value than MacBook Pro 2021 that should suit creators, business users and students demanding power from their machines. Dell XPS 13 is a direct competitor to the MacBook Pro 2021. It comes in 13-inch and 15-inch models with near bezel-less InfinityEdge LCD touchscreen and an attractive design. Powered by Intel’s latest and greatest Core-i3, i5, and i7 processors, the XPS 13 arrives with 8GB to 32GB of RAM and offers a selection of SSD storage – starting at 256GB capacity. Intel Iris Xe Graphics drives the display which comes in InfinityEdge OLED option as well – offering richer colors and better contrast – but for a $300 premium from the standard model. The very durable Dell XPS 13 features CNC machined aluminum chassis with choice of either carbon fiber or frost-finish palm rest. The laptop’s battery life stretches over 10 hours and for the ones who are more interested in a convertible, XPS 13 2-in-1 is also a great pick. Dell XPS 13 comes in different configurations for you to choose from. That means you can select according to the choice of hardware and specs your routine may demand starting at around $1,000. Most interestingly, all configurations of the laptop arrive with the same keyboard, speakers, ports and touchpad, which ensure your choice comes down to the memory, storage and processor and you get your preference without overspending. The ASUS ZenBook 13 OLED UX325 is one of the lightest and most portable OLED laptops on the market starting at $799.99. The exceptionally thin device is finished in glossy gray metal chassis and is powered by the choice of Intel 11th generation processors. The 13.3-inch OLED 1920 x 1080 Full HD panel has limited 400 nits of brightness, but it’s powered by Intel Iris Xe Graphics. The display features only 2.9mm bezel and the ASUS laptop tips the scale at 2.45 pounds. With stellar performance from 11th gen Intel Core i5 or Core i7 processor paired with up to 16GB RAM and up to 512GB SSD; the Asus ZenBook 13 is an outstanding blend of maximum performance in a lightweight design. The newly designed keyboard – from the previous ZenBook 13 – features a large trackpad and thanks to an ErgoLift hinge, can be raised up slightly for comfortable typing angle when the screen is opened. The ASUS ZenBook 13 OLED UX325 lasts for up to 13 hours on a single charge and comes with a 65W adaptor in the box. It can connect with up to three external displays using HDMI and two Thunderbolt 4 ports and also features microSD card reader and ASUS’s USB-C charging system. Razor laptops are prominently known for their gaming skills; but the Razer Book 13 with configuration options for ones who want to engage in multitasking, is a high-performance device to look for in comparison to the MacBook Pro. The 13.4-inch display of the Razor Book 13 features an extremely thin bezel and supports a tall 16:10 aspect ratio. The display is offered in Full HD+ or Ultra HD+ options with touch support. Beginning at $1,199.99, this Razor laptop is cut out from a single piece aluminum and offered in white anodized finish. The ultra-productivity laptop is powered by a choice of 11th generation Intel Core i5 or i7 processors, integrated Intel Iris Xe Graphics, and starts at 8GB of RAM and 256GB PCIe SSD storage. Users can pick from up to 16GB of RAM and up to 512GB SSD storage. The Razor Book 13 arrives with enough connection options including HDMI 2.0, two Thunderbolt 4, microSD card slot and a 3.5mm headphone jack. For connectivity, like every productivity laptop, you get Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.1 support and according to Razor it features two booming speakers and has a glass touchpad. HP Spectre x360 14 is a capable MacBook Pro competitor, more so because it even weighs heavy on the Dell XPS, a few performance tests indicate. One of the best 2-in-1 laptops right now, the HP Spectre x360 14 arrives in a durable body with a premium appearance. Its 13.5-inch display with 3:2 aspect ratio is designed to increase user productivity. The users can choose either between the base 1920 x 1280 IPS display or upgrade to the 3000 x 2000 OLED display for more colors and contrast. Spectre x360 14 is not just premium in appearance, it is a pleasurable productivity laptop whose guts are powered by 11th generation Intel core i5 or i7 processors and integrated Iris Xe Graphics. The laptop comes with at least 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, which can be customized to preference. Available in Nightfall Black and Natural Silver hues, the convertible laptop is slightly on the larger side yet it feels premium in the hand. It offers about 10 hours of battery backup and is provided with a stylus that attaches magnetically to the side of the laptop and lets you get creative when the Spectre is used as a tablet. Starting at $1,150, the HP Spectre x360 14 has enough ports, comfortable trackpad and keyboard, and delivers exceptional audio. Presenting the HP Spectre x360 14 a serious competition in the convertible domain and giving the expensive MacBook Pro a run for its money; Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio arrives as a versatile performance machine that flips into studio or tablet form factor to be used with a Surface Pen. The interesting two-tiered design of the laptop makes it slightly thinker than most Surface devices, while it’s the tilting display that renders the laptop a little flimsy but gives us different ways to position the screen. You get a smooth hepatic trackpad that’s exceptional to use. Its feedback intensity can be configured from settings. The keyboard however on the Surface Laptop Studio is similar to other Surface laptops, while the 14.4-inch, 120Hz PixelSense flow touchscreen sets it in the league of its own. The 3:2 aspect ratio display supports 10-point multi-touch and Dolby Vision but it lacks an anti-glare layer. Ideal for business use, creative work and a lot of media consumption, the Surface Laptop Studio runs Windows 11 out of the box, which gives it very integrated experience. The laptop in its base configuration comprises Intel Core i5, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD and starts at $1,599.99; it also comes in high-end Intel Core i7, 32GB RAM, and 1TB SSD configuration.",,slashgear

Unsurprisingly, there are a few manufacturers that are now trying to capitalize on that newfound popularity of the platform before demand dries up. Of all the PC makers, however, LG has been noticeably absent on that scene for years, but that might be changing now that the existence of a certain LG Chromebook has been sighted. This wouldn’t be LG’s first brush with Chrome OS. In 2014, it launched the LG Chromebase , the first of its kind to put Google’s young platform on an all-in-one computer with a large 21.5-inch screen. Since then, however, Chrome OS has never become a thing for LG, and the company has never launched a laptop-form Chromebook at all. Chrome Unboxed is quite excited to have spotted the mention of an “LG Chromebook” in a Bluetooth SIG filing. The name alone is already telling, pointing to form factor. Unfortunately, that’s all that’s available at the moment, leaving the door open to speculation and wishful thinking. This LG Chromebook could, for example, be branded as an LG Gram Chromebook, which would be a good fit for the company’s thin and light laptops. That would also imply that it would be powered by an Intel CPU, a processor that LG has had plenty of experience with. The device might also target the budget market, which is a safer bet for a relative newcomer to the Chromebook space. LG’s return to Chrome OS is perhaps perfectly timed within the context of current trends in the personal computing space. The company also has plenty of opportunities to break into a new market after its withdrawal from the mobile race. With CES 2022 expected to become a big return to in-person events, it’s also a perfect time for LG to reveal its comeback with its first-ever Chromebook.",,slashgear

Astronomers may have discovered the first planet outside of our galaxy,https://phys.org/news/2021-10-astronomers-planet-galaxy.html,,,,"Signs of a planet transiting a star outside of the Milky Way galaxy may have been detected for the first time. This intriguing result, using NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, opens up a new window to search for exoplanets at greater distances than ever before.",,2021-10-25 16:13:39,"Signs of a planet transiting a star outside of the Milky Way galaxy may have been detected for the first time. This intriguing result, using NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, opens up a new window to search for exoplanets at greater distances than ever before. The possible exoplanet candidate is located in the spiral galaxy Messier 51 (M51), also called the Whirlpool Galaxy because of its distinctive profile. Exoplanets are defined as planets outside of our Solar System. Until now, astronomers have found all other known exoplanets and exoplanet candidates in the Milky Way galaxy, almost all of them less than about 3,000 light-years from Earth. An exoplanet in M51 would be about 28 million light-years away, meaning it would be thousands of times farther away than those in the Milky Way. ""We are trying to open up a whole new arena for finding other worlds by searching for planet candidates at X-ray wavelengths, a strategy that makes it possible to discover them in other galaxies,"" said Rosanne Di Stefano of the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian (CfA) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who led the study, which was published today in Nature Astronomy . This new result is based on transits, events in which the passage of a planet in front of a star blocks some of the star's light and produces a characteristic dip. Astronomers using both ground-based and space-based telescopes—like those on NASA's Kepler and TESS missions—have searched for dips in optical light, electromagnetic radiation humans can see, enabling the discovery of thousands of planets. Di Stefano and colleagues have instead searched for dips in the brightness of X-rays received from X-ray bright binaries. These luminous systems typically contain a neutron star or black hole pulling in gas from a closely orbiting companion star. The material near the neutron star or black hole becomes superheated and glows in X-rays. Because the region producing bright X-rays is small, a planet passing in front of it could block most or all of the X-rays, making the transit easier to spot because the X-rays can completely disappear. This could allow exoplanets to be detected at much greater distances than current optical light transit studies, which must be able to detect tiny decreases in light because the planet only blocks a tiny fraction of the star. The team used this method to detect the exoplanet candidate in a binary system called M51-ULS-1, located in M51. This binary system contains a black hole or neutron star orbiting a companion star with a mass about 20 times that of the Sun. The X-ray transit they found using Chandra data lasted about three hours, during which the X-ray emission decreased to zero. Based on this and other information, the researchers estimate the exoplanet candidate in M51-ULS-1 would be roughly the size of Saturn, and orbit the neutron star or black hole at about twice the distance of Saturn from the Sun. While this is a tantalizing study, more data would be needed to verify the interpretation as an extragalactic exoplanet. One challenge is that the planet candidate's large orbit means it would not cross in front of its binary partner again for about 70 years, thwarting any attempts for a confirming observation for decades. ""Unfortunately to confirm that we're seeing a planet we would likely have to wait decades to see another transit,"" said co-author Nia Imara of the University of California at Santa Cruz. ""And because of the uncertainties about how long it takes to orbit, we wouldn't know exactly when to look."" Can the dimming have been caused by a cloud of gas and dust passing in front of the X-ray source? The researchers consider this to be an unlikely explanation, as the characteristics of the event observed in M51-ULS-1 are not consistent with the passage of such a cloud. The model of a planet candidate is, however, consistent with the data. ""We know we are making an exciting and bold claim so we expect that other astronomers will look at it very carefully,"" said co-author Julia Berndtsson of Princeton University in New Jersey. ""We think we have a strong argument, and this process is how science works."" If a planet exists in this system, it likely had a tumultuous history and violent past. An exoplanet in the system would have had to survive a supernova explosion that created the neutron star or black hole. The future may also be dangerous. At some point the companion star could also explode as a supernova and blast the planet once again with extremely high levels of radiation. Di Stefano and her colleagues looked for X-ray transits in three galaxies beyond the Milky Way galaxy, using both Chandra and the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton. Their search covered 55 systems in M51, 64 systems in Messier 101 (the ""Pinwheel"" galaxy), and 119 systems in Messier 104 (the ""Sombrero"" galaxy), resulting in the single exoplanet candidate described here. The authors will search the archives of both Chandra and XMM-Newton for more exoplanet candidates in other galaxies. Substantial Chandra datasets are available for at least 20 galaxies, including some like M31 and M33 that are much closer than M51, allowing shorter transits to be detectable. Another interesting line of research is to search for X-ray transits in Milky Way X-ray sources to discover new nearby planets in unusual environments.

Internal Facebook documents highlight its moderation and misinformation issues,https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/internal-facebook-documents-highlight-its-moderation-and-misinformation-issues/,"['Column', 'Social', 'TC', 'Facebook', 'tceng']",['Darrell Etherington'],,"The Facebook Papers, a vast trove of documents supplied by a whistleblower to news organizations has been released, and paints a picture of a company that repeatedly sought to prioritize profit.","Daniel Cooper Contributor Daniel Cooper is a senior editor at Engadget. More posts by this contributor Withings puts its heart-monitoring ScanWatch in the body of a diver’s watch Oh hey, Xiaomi has its own creepy robot dog now The Facebook Papers, a vast trove of documents supplied by whistleblower Frances Haugen to a consortium of news organizations has been released. The reporting, by Reuters, Bloomberg, The Washington Post and others, paints a picture of a company that repeatedly sought to prioritize dominance and profit over user safety. This was, however, despite a large number of employees warning that the company’s focus on engagement put users at risk of real-world violence. The Washington Post, for instance, claims that while Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg played down reports that the site amplified hate speech in testimony to Congress, he was aware that the problem was far broader than publicly declared. Internal documents seen by the Post claim that the social network had removed less than five percent of hate speech, and that executives — including Zuckerberg — were well aware that Facebook was polarizing people. The claims have already been rebutted by Facebook, which says that the documents have been misrepresented. Zuckerberg is also accused of squashing a plan to run a Spanish-language voter-registration drive in the US before the 2020 elections. He said that the plan may have appeared “partisan,” with WhatsApp staffers subsequently offering a watered-down version partnering with outside agencies. The CEO was also reportedly behind the decision not to clamp down on COVID-19 misinformation in the early stages of the pandemic as there may be a “material tradeoff with MSI [Meaningful Social Interaction — an internal Facebook metric] impact.” Facebook has refuted the claim, saying that the documents have been mischaracterized. Reuters reported that Facebook has serially neglected a number of developing nations, allowing hate speech and extremism to flourish. That includes not hiring enough staffers who can speak the local language, appreciate the cultural context and otherwise effectively moderate. The result is that the company has unjustified faith in its automatic moderation systems which are ineffective in non-English speaking countries. Again, Facebook has refuted the accusation that it is neglecting its users in those territories. One specific region that is singled out for concern is Myanmar, where Facebook has been held responsible for amplifying local tensions. A 2020 document suggests that the company’s automatic moderation system could not flag problematic terms in (local language) Burmese. (It should be noted that, two years previously, Facebook’s failure to properly act to prevent civil unrest in Myanmar was highlighted in a report from Business for Social Responsibility.) Similarly, Facebook reportedly did not have the tools in place to detect hate speech in the Ethiopian languages of Oromo or Amharic. Facebook has said that it is working to expand its content moderation team and, in the last two years, has recruited Oromo, Amharic and Burmese speakers (as well as a number of other languages). The New York Times, reports that Facebook’s internal research was well-aware that the Like and Share functions — core elements of how the platform work — had accelerated the spread of hate speech. A document, titled What Is Collateral Damage, says that Facebook’s failure to remedy these issues will see the company “actively (if not necessarily consciously) promoting these types of activities.” Facebook says that, again, these statements are based on incorrect premises, and that it would be illogical for the company to try and actively harm its users. Bloomberg, meanwhile, has focused on the supposed collapse in Facebook’s engagement metrics. Young people, a key target market for advertisers, are spending less time on Facebook’s platform, with fewer teens opting to sign up. At the same time, the number of users may be artificially inflated in these age groups, with users choosing to create multiple accounts — “Finstas” — to separate their online personas to cater to different groups. Haugen alleges that Facebook “has misrepresented core metrics to investors and advertisers,” and that duplicate accounts are leading to “extensive fraud” against advertisers. Facebook says that it already notifies advertisers of the risk that purchases will reach duplicate accounts in its Help Center, and lists the issue in its SEC filings. Over the weekend, Axios reported that Facebook’s Sir Nick Clegg warned that the site should expect “more bad headlines” in the coming weeks. Between the material available in the Facebook Papers, another round of Frances Haugen’s testimony in the UK later today and rumors of more whistleblowers coming forward, it’s likely that Facebook will remain in the headlines for some time.

macOS Monterey Rolling Out Now: How to Download,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/laptops/news/macos-monterey-apple-roll-out-launch-upgrade-available-features-how-to-download-2587534,,,,"macOS Monterey is now rolling out to all Mac machines. Available for free, the new macOS brings in a number of new features. Here's how you can download it.",,2021-10-25 17:00:01,"macOS Monterey, the latest operating system from Apple, has started rolling out to all Mac machines on Monday. Introduced in June at the Cupertino company's WWDC 2021 event, Monterey comes as a successor to last year's macOS Big Sur. Among its many new features, the latest macOS brings a redesigned Safari and “exciting new” FaceTime updates. It also offers handy features such as Universal Control, Focus, and Shortcuts. Apple is primarily focussing on multi-device usage with macOS Monterey, as it promises a more fluid experience than its predecessors. macOS Monterey doesn't quite follow the footsteps of its predecessor, the Big Sur . While Big Sur brought in an interface-level facelift , macOS Monterey is more focussed on tweaking the overall user experience . Encouraging users to engage with more Apple products, Monterey's Universal Control feature allows seamless usage of different devices such as an iPad or a MacBook or an iMac or even an Apple Pencil — all at the same time. For example, if you make a sketch or take a note on a Keynote presentation with your Apple Pencil on an iPad, it will automatically show up on your Mac machine. To encourage even more interconnectivity, macOS Monterey also brings AirPlay to Mac machines. So, you can now blast your favourite tunes on your powerful iMac speakers via the quick, wireless connection. Of course, you can share content between Apple devices as well via AirPlay. For those who FaceTime a lot, Apple now offers spatial audio support to the chats, along with a fresh Grid View which automatically the participant who is speaking for easier understanding for all. Chats will now also be free of most background noise, thanks to the new voice isolation feature on mics which will also bring your voice “front and centre” during calls. FaceTime's SharePlay feature also lets users share items such as movies or projects with friends over a call. Safari users can now enjoy a cleaner interface with the new Tab Groups feature that helps save and mange multiple tabs under the umbrella of a single title. Tab Groups will also seamlessly synchronise across all devices to ease workflow. macOS Monterey's Shortcuts feature works similar to its iPhone or iPad counterparts, helping automate tasks on a Mac machine. Users can edit Shortcuts to suit their own tasks and needs. Click here to check out a full list of all the new changes macOS Monterey brings to the table. macOS Monterey comes a free upgrade to all Mac machines, including the likes of iMac (late 2015 and later), MacBook Air (early 2015 and later), and Mac mini (late 2014 and later). The update should reach you automatically. To download the update, go to System Preferences > Software Update .

Smart doorbells: how to use them without being fined for infringing a neighbour's privacy,https://theconversation.com/smart-doorbells-how-to-use-them-without-being-fined-for-infringing-a-neighbours-privacy-170180,,"['Andrew Charlesworth', ' Professor of Law', ' Innovation and Society', ' University of Bristol']",,,"RossHelen/ShutterstockAs any local solicitor can tell you, some of the most bitter legal disputes originate from disagreements between neighbours. Whether it’s property boundaries, loud music or parking spaces, what might initially be minor irritations can gradually lead to a full-blown court battle. A relatively recent development in neighbour conflicts are clashes centred on home surveillance products, such as CCTV cameras and smart doorbells. These technologies, which may capture footage beyond the householder’s property, can pit householders against neighbours who feel their homes and private lives are being unfairly spied upon. Indeed, a UK judge recently ruled that a man’s home security system invaded his neighbour’s privacy, and he now faces a fine of up to £100,000. So what are the privacy implications of this technology, and what do people need to know if they have, or are considering installing, a smart doorbell? Read more: Zao's deepfake face-swapping app shows uploading your photos is riskier than ever The use of surveillance technologies is governed by a range of measures. Some provide advice and guidance, like the surveillance camera code of practice, which sets out principles for operators to follow. Others are legal requirements, such as the rules for collection and processing of personal data under the Data Protection Act 2018 and the UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). These measures aim to ensure that any use of surveillance technologies is for legitimate purposes, proportionate, and compliant with relevant legal obligations. A key concern is that surveillance should, as far as possible, be with the informed consent of those surveilled. Where do smart doorbells fit in? Purely “domestic use” of personal data by a private individual is exempted from the data protection legislation – for example your list of addresses for sending Christmas cards. But it’s well established that home surveillance systems, including CCTV and smart doorbells, are subject to UK data protection legislation. A key case in 2014 looked at the use of a home CCTV system by a Mr Ryneš in the Czech Republic. The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) held that while Ryneš’ CCTV system was installed for a legitimate purpose – the protection of his property and personal security – the data collection went beyond that permitted solely for domestic use. This is because it collected personal data from a public space, including a footpath and the entrance to his neighbour’s house opposite. With this ruling, the CJEU confirmed that domestic surveillance systems fall within the scope of the data protection legislation where they capture data beyond the boundaries of the homeowner’s property. This interpretation remains applicable under UK law for now, although the UK government could potentially alter the scope of the “domestic exemption” now that the UK has left the EU. Smart doorbells notify the homeowner via an app when someone is outside their property. siamionau pavel/Shutterstock While this case and others that have followed since didn’t involve smart doorbells specifically, the principle is the same. The case of Fairhurst vs Woodard in the English County Court in October 2021 reinforces the view that the courts are likely to take a dim view of those who fail to use home surveillance equipment in a way that respects the rights of other people, including their neighbours. Woodard installed a range of surveillance technology, including CCTV cameras and a smart doorbell, for home security purposes. But these could record video and audio well beyond the boundaries of his property. He then actively misled his neighbour, Fairhurst, as to how and when the cameras operated. The court found Woodard to have breached his data protection obligation to process data in a lawful and transparent way, and to have collected personal data without a specified or lawful purpose, as required by the Data Protection Act 2018 and the GDPR. Read more: What does GDPR mean for me? An explainer The court did recognise that home security could be a legitimate purpose for collection of data that would otherwise breach a neighbour’s right to privacy, if the collection was reasonable and proportionate for that purpose. For example, in relation to Woodard’s Amazon Ring doorbell, the court held that capture of incidental personal data (such as video of Fairhurst walking past) was permissible. However, the capture of audio at a significant distance exceeded what was reasonable for the purposes, as did the fact the system’s viewing range recorded large areas of Fairhurst’s property, including her side gate, garden and parking space. It’s worth noting that Woodard’s use of his home surveillance system, and his interaction with Fairhurst concerning that use, also led to a successful action for harassment against him. Some tips If you’re considering installing a home surveillance system, such as a smart doorbell, you should: identify a clear and justified purpose for your use of CCTV, such as home security; when purchasing a system, consider the scope of data it can capture, whether this is reasonable for your intended purpose, and if the system can be tailored to protect other people’s privacy rights. For example, with some systems it’s possible to disable audio, and to set “privacy” zones which are not recorded; ensure there is signage stating recording is taking place, and why; keep all data collected secure and accessible only to those who need it, and delete it when no longer needed; comply with requirements of the Data Protection Act 2018 and the GDPR, such as responding to requests from individuals about data you may hold on them, and deleting data if requested to do so. The Information Commissioner’s Office has also produced some helpful advice for people installing home CCTV systems. Pleasingly, providers are becoming more aware of the risks and requirements of home surveillance technologies and are building in new features which may encourage lawful use. For example, Amazon has recently added end-to-end encryption to its smart doorbell technologies. This aims to keep personal data captured secure against misuse by third parties by restricting access to video and audio streams to specified devices and permitted users.

Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy review - breezy but unfocused action,https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-10-25-marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-review-breezy-but-unfocused-action,,,,"I'm not sure what Guardians of the Galaxy wants to be.On one hand, it's a wonderfully accessible adventure wrapped up in family-friendly packaging, with an action-packed storyline that takes you on a delightful voyage through some of the galaxy's most colourful climes.

I'm not sure what Guardians of the Galaxy wants to be. On one hand, it's a wonderfully accessible adventure wrapped up in family-friendly packaging, with an action-packed storyline that takes you on a delightful voyage through some of the galaxy's most colourful climes. On the other, it boasts an aggressively complex combat system that requires a high degree of digit-dexterity and rarely forgives your mistakes. Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy review Developer: Eidos Montréal Publisher: Square Enix Platform: Played on PS5 Availability: Out 26th October on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch On a third hand (well, we're literally in alien territory here, so indulge me), the game routinely pastes together blistering action sequences with monotonous walk-down-this-corridor scenes, rambling exposition, and a generous dollop of tedious teamster ""banter"" on the side. It makes for an extraordinarily uneven experience that means you're usually only doing one of two things in Guardians of the Galaxy: getting your arse kicked by a cube of jelly; or being somewhere en-route to getting your arse kicked, listening to the other Guardians squabble. That's not to say I didn't enjoy my time with Guardians of the Galaxy, though. Admittedly, during the earlier chapters, I actively did not have fun. As much as I liked getting to know the cast (which I come to as an MCU noob having - GASP! - never seen the movies), it felt like the game was doing all it could to keep me from getting immersed in its world-building. If you're still desperate for an Marvel afficionado's take specifically, here's Aoife Wilson's impressions from an hour with GOTG. Watch on YouTube And it is a story worth hearing, by the way. Whilst the forced banter and arguments you're compelled to wade through feel a tad inelegant at times, the story of how Star-Lord Peter Quill and the rest of the Guardians - Drax, Gamora, Groot, and Rocket - come to save the galaxy this time around is a predictable, if curiously poignant, tale of love and loss... although the emotional impact of its climax dissolves pretty swiftly when you're forced into an infuriating final boss fight. To touch too deeply on the story will teeter into spoiler territory, so I promise I won't do that here, or even list the names of the characters and creatures you square up against (mainly because I have no idea who or what may be surprises taken directly from the cinematic universe). I can say, however, that in atonement for straying into a Quarantine Zone and being caught carrying contraband, the Guardians are forced to pay a hefty fine that, even collectively, the unmerry band of outcasts can ill afford. And so our story begins. Looks Groot, right? The trouble is, despite its PG-13 presentation and wondrously peculiar lifeforms - there's no blood, gore, or overt violence here, and I wasn't joking when I said one of the enemy types you take on is a cube of jelly - Guardians of the Galaxy's combat is tough and its enemies frustratingly spongey. Not only can you punch foes, but you can shoot them, fire elemental shots, perform special attacks, instruct your teammates to attack, tell them to dole out special attacks, or deploy the ultimate power move by having all of the Guardians attack at once. That sounds cool enough - and it is when it works out - but a lot of the time, there's so much visual noise and noise noise that it's hard to keep track of what's going on on-screen. Add in environment traps, electric mines, stagger meters, mystical shields, and a broken health recovery system - Quill will merrily collect health drops around him regardless of whether or not he needs them, which means when you do need them, they're all gone - and I found myself succumbing to the bad guys with embarrassing frequency. Oh, and for good measure, the Guardians refuse to revive each other too (there's one notable exception, but that's straying into spoiler territory again), so you're often fighting the ""heal"" button prompt as much as the enemies themselves. It's a tightly controlled experience, though, one that whizzes you through the story on rails with zero opportunities to explore off the beaten path. In some ways, it's hard to fault the game for that - Guardians of the Galaxy is a gorgeous looking game that boasts some truly stunning vignettes by forcing your perspective; I took 280 screenshots - but it does mean there's little merit in turning left when the others turn right. Most of the time you'll uncover a dead end rather than a secret collectable. ""There's a lot here that Eidos can be proud of, but those things are hard to find amongst an oversaturation of systems and mechanics."" And there's so much else - maybe too much else? Quick time events. Wwwwwoooaaaahhhh! slide sequences. Real-time combat. Environmental puzzles. Momentum streaks. Team takedowns. Spaceship battles and chases. Watchdog-esque hacking sequences. Swappable outfits. Dialogue choices, but I don't think they have a bearing on the outcome of the game. Unlockable perks, but I gathered enough resources to unlock all but one in my first playthrough. Ability points, but there's not a lot of those, either, even though you can unlock new abilities for Gamora and the lads as well as Quill. But wait, there's more! An obnoxious visor that coats your surroundings in a sickly hot pink glow to help discover lore, resources, or tips on what to do next, but I often found it unreliable, failing to properly choreograph my next steps. It's great that Edios has worked so hard to keep gameplay fresh, sure, but the downside of this is that you're never certain what the hell you're supposed to do next. If you're stuck and can't progress, is it because you haven't instructed a Guardian to do something or do you need to do it yourself? The most curious of all, however, is the Guardians' huddle, which unceremoniously yanks you from the fight into a first-person point-of-view to gee up - or calm down - your squaddies. To be successful, you need to listen to them - some will be cock-sure; others fearful of defeat - and pick from two responses to get them refocused. It's utterly pointless, though, as, during the speeches, keywords will appear in the air behind them to really hammer it home, so all you have to do is match the words to the statement. It adds nothing to the game other than a chance to reset the cooldown on the Guardians' special moves and allow you to kick butt to Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go or some other delightful 80s tune. It was sadly buggy, too. Playing the PS5 version, I encountered numerous issues, including a good dozen crashes, progress and audio glitches, broken button-prompts and HUD instructions - I once had ""Chapter 3 - The Cost of Freedom"" emblazoned across the top of my screen for 20 minutes, and a triangle prompt that wouldn't go away until a soft reset - and it took six attempts and an overnight reprieve to conquer the Dweller of Darkness boss fight because each time I cut off its third appendage, the game would crash. Bugs aside, there's a lot here that Eidos can be proud of, but those things are hard to find amongst an oversaturation of gameplay systems and mechanics, and uninspired combat. As much as I enjoyed the game's stunning set-pieces and thoughtful storyline - not to mention the prerequisite post-credits (and post-post-credits) scenes - unlocking the full complement of your pals' sparring skillsets and getting to the end of Guardians of the Galaxy feels like an unmitigated slog when you're fighting an endless sea of tanky, bullet-spongey Centurions. And I still can't quite understand why a game that relies so heavily on cooperative play offers no co-op option at all. Will you support Eurogamer?

World of Tanks Blitz 8.4,https://tweakers.net/downloads/57966/world-of-tanks-blitz-84.html,"['Software-update', 'Software']",['Japke Rosink'],,"World of Tanks Blitz wordt ontwikkeld door Wargaming, de maker van World of Tanks, World of Warships, World of Warplanes, Master of Orion en Total War: Arena. Het kan gezien worden als het kleine, snelle broertje van World of Tanks, en is een free-to-play, onlinespel waarin spelers elkaar in teams bestrijden met tanks uit de periode tussen grofweg 1925 en 1965. Het spel is gratis te spelen, maar maakt gebruik van microtransacties, waarmee je bijvoorbeeld betere munitie of premiumvoertuigen kunt aanschaffen. Het spel draait op Android, iOS, macOS en Windows. Daarnaast is het ook via Steam beschikbaar. World of Tanks Blitz 8.4 is enkele dagen geleden uitgebracht met de volgende aankondiging: Update 8.4 Polish Heavies The new branch of five researchable Tier VI–X heavy tanks has joined the European Nation! Each is well-armed, perfectly armored, and very dangerous! These Poles come with their own consumables that will bring you new tactical opportunities. Both newcomers and experienced commanders will enjoy riding the new heavies into battle. Economy Lesson We're continuing to refine the credit economy. This time, the changes will affect researchable Tier I–VI vehicles. Previously, the number of battles required to accumulate credits and research each subsequent tank could vary quite widely depending on the branch. To balance out this uneven profitability, starting from Update 8.4, some tanks will earn a little more, while others will earn a little less. These changes won't apply to Premium vehicles. Holiday Camos and New Arrivals Halloween is coming! While we ""probably"" won't go from Garage to Garage asking for consumables, it would be nice to dress up for this fun-filled occasion. Spooky Web, Pumpkin Mayhem, Pumpkin Spice, Scary Swarm, and Spidertrap are available again in the Camouflage tab. Also, with Update 8.4, you'll be able to get the harsh Bulwark camo for the harsh X T110E3 tank destroyer. Here are the new Legendary camos! Owners of the X T95E6 will soon receive an offer to purchase the feisty Piranha camo, while commanders of the X AMX 30 B will be offered to get the gorgeous Corsica camo.

Covid-19 antigen tests ‘reducing spread’ in meat plants,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/covid-19-antigen-tests-reducing-spread-in-meat-plants-1.4710038?localLinksEnabled=false,,,,"Antigen testing in meat plants since March has reduced the risk of Covid-19 outbreaks and made them safer, the Department of Agriculture’s director of laboratories has said. The department has been overseeing antigen testing of 4,000 workers in meat plants every week after a pilot in January found that the rapid antigen tests picked up about four out of five positive results confirmed by PCR tests, the standard and more sensitive test used by the HSE. Dr Donal Sammin, assistant secretary of the department who is in charge of the testing programme, said antigen testing was “perfectly good enough” at preventing the spread of Covid-19 in meat plants where the circulation of chilled air encouraged the transmission of the virus. He told The Irish Times that the antigen tests had allowed food businesses to pick out and remove workers most likely to transmit infection quickly from the factories before there was a chance of a “super-spreading event occurring in the plant”. “It is not as sensitive as PCR, but it’s a good measure of infectivity. Our use of this test wasn’t so much to use it as an accurate diagnostic in individual workers; it was about using it as a risk-reduction tool in a population of people to make the workplace safer for all,” he said. Long resisted by public health officials because of concerns about their accuracy, the general use of antigen tests is only now being given an enhanced role in the Government’s response to Covid-19. Asymptomatic people In an effort to suppress the spread of the virus, the State will send antigen test kits to fully vaccinated asymptomatic people who are found to be close contacts of confirmed cases. The Department of Agriculture found antigen testing to be effective in a validation study carried out on meat workers at the start of this year. Tests on 5,111 workers in 17 meat plants in January compared antigen and PCR test results and found that 41 people tested positive on both tests. Some 79 tested positive on the PCR tests but when the viral load was taken into account and those least likely to be infectious – or those who possibly had the virus previously and were no longer infectious – the antigen test picked up 79 per cent of positives confirmed by the PCR tests. “When we look at those PCR positives, a rapid test is picking up four out of five of those so it is doing exactly what we would hope it would do,” said Dr Sammin. The sample found just two false positives out of the sample. “One of the fears people have had about these rapid tests is that you might be getting a lot of false positives; that has not been our experience,” he said. A key advantage of the antigen test is the result is available in 15 minutes whereas a PCR test typically takes two working days from a lab “which is too long to break transmission cycles”.",,2021-10-26 02:33:15,"Antigen testing in meat plants since March has reduced the risk of Covid-19 outbreaks and made them safer, the Department of Agriculture’s director of laboratories has said. The department has been overseeing antigen testing of 4,000 workers in meat plants every week after a pilot in January found that the rapid antigen tests picked up about four out of five positive results confirmed by PCR tests, the standard and more sensitive test used by the HSE. Dr Donal Sammin , assistant secretary of the department who is in charge of the testing programme, said antigen testing was “perfectly good enough” at preventing the spread of Covid-19 in meat plants where the circulation of chilled air encouraged the transmission of the virus. He told The Irish Times that the antigen tests had allowed food businesses to pick out and remove workers most likely to transmit infection quickly from the factories before there was a chance of a “super-spreading event occurring in the plant”. “It is not as sensitive as PCR, but it’s a good measure of infectivity. Our use of this test wasn’t so much to use it as an accurate diagnostic in individual workers; it was about using it as a risk-reduction tool in a population of people to make the workplace safer for all,” he said. Long resisted by public health officials because of concerns about their accuracy, the general use of antigen tests is only now being given an enhanced role in the Government’s response to Covid-19. In an effort to suppress the spread of the virus, the State will send antigen test kits to fully vaccinated asymptomatic people who are found to be close contacts of confirmed cases. The Department of Agriculture found antigen testing to be effective in a validation study carried out on meat workers at the start of this year. Tests on 5,111 workers in 17 meat plants in January compared antigen and PCR test results and found that 41 people tested positive on both tests. Some 79 tested positive on the PCR tests but when the viral load was taken into account and those least likely to be infectious – or those who possibly had the virus previously and were no longer infectious – the antigen test picked up 79 per cent of positives confirmed by the PCR tests. “When we look at those PCR positives, a rapid test is picking up four out of five of those so it is doing exactly what we would hope it would do,” said Dr Sammin.

"TG4: “Go leor bainte amach ach go leor, leor, fós le déanamh”",https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/tuarasc%C3%A1il/tg4-go-leor-bainte-amach-ach-go-leor-leor-f%C3%B3s-le-d%C3%A9anamh-1.4707950?localLinksEnabled=false,,,,"FOCLÓIR: Ardán - platform; spleodrach - lively; tionscal cruthaitheach - creative industry; ré nua - new era; coibhneas - proportional relationship; closamharc - audiovisual; nuálach - innovative; éiceachóras - ecosystem; sclaigeach - potholed. ‘Sílim gur éirigh linn dul i bhfeidhm ar shochaí na tíre le branda TG4 ar bhealach nach raibh aon duine ag súil leis.” Sin a bhí le rá ag Alan Esslemont, Ardstiúrthóir ar TG4, agus é ag machnamh ar a bhfuil bainte amach ag an stáisiún náisiúnta Gaeilge, agus ceiliúradh 25 bliain ar aerthonnta na tíre ar na bacáin. Céim stairiúil a bhí ann i saol na Gaeilge nuair a bunaíodh ardán nua closamhairc do theanga dhúchais na tíre le seoladh Teilifís na Gaeilge ar Oíche Shamhna 1996. Tógadh tionscal cruthaitheach Gaeilge nach raibh ann go nuige sin agus cuireadh seirbhís teilifíse ilghnéithí ar fáil don Ghaeltacht agus do phobal na Gaeilge atá ina crann seasta i saol na Gaeilge ó shin i leith. “Sílim go bhfuil íomhá níos spleodraí, níos tarraingtí ag an nGaeilge go náisiúnta mar gheall ar sin,” a dúirt Esslemont le Tuarascáil. “Tá go leor bainte amach ach go leor, leor, fós le déanamh.” Dar ndóigh ní raibh gach aon duine ag súil le ré nua i gcraolachán na tíre nuair a bunaíodh an tseirbhís nua Gaeilge. A luaithe agus a fógraíodh go raibh sé beartaithe an stáisiún nua a chur ar bun baineadh úsáid as gach leithscéal faoin spéir chun cur ina choinne. Cur amú airgid a bheadh ann! Ó ghéarchéim na ndrugaí go staid na mbóithre sclaigeacha ní raibh ní ar bith beo nár thuill níos mó caiteachas stáit ná stáisiún éigin Gaeilge. Caiteachas gan tairbhe a bheadh ansin! Ach éalaíonn an t-am go mear, níorbh bhuan do na cáinteoirí agus ligeadh don tionscnamh dul ar aghaidh gan ach corr fhogha á thabhairt faoi. Tá stádas bainte amach ag TG4 i sochaí na tíre anois agus craoltar réimse leathan clár Gaeilge go tráthrialta atá ar ardchaighdeán. “An rud is tábhachtaí do TG4 i gcónaí ná an t-ábhar, na cláir agus an lucht féachana,” a dúirt Esslemont. “Le 25 bliana anuas tá an t-uafás déanta againn”. Dar ndóigh tá an Ghaeilge ag croí-lár thogra TG4. Ardán atá ann a thugann glór do phobal atá faoi bhrú agus a dhéantar neamhaird air i saol an Bhéarla go ró-mhinic. Ach, nuair a chraoltar tuairisc faoi imeacht éigin sa tír, mar a tharlaíonn go laethúil ar Nuacht TG4, agus nuair a fheictear agallaimh á gcur ar an oiread sin daoine a bhfuil Gaeilge acu, is léiriú é sin go bhfuil pobal labhartha na Gaeilge beo agus bríomhar. Is fíor nach labhraíonn muintir na hÉireann ar fad Gaeilge gach lá. Ach mealltar líon den phobal sin nach mbeadh mórán teagmhála acu leis an teanga de ghnáth. Mar shampla, ó thaobh na Gaeilge de, ba thalamh bán é an rugbaí go dtí gur thosaigh TG4 á chraoladh le tráchtaireacht i nGaeilge. Cinnte, is cúis ghearáin é ó am go chéile an méid Béarla a chloistear ar an stáisiún ach táthar ag súil go ligfidh breis acmhainní don stáisiún bheith ina sheirbhís lán-Ghaeilge amach anseo. Agus, is ar an todhchaí atáthar ag díriú anois. Gillian Ní Cheallaigh agus Gráinne Seoige i seomra nuachta TnaG i 1996. Fís tar éis Covid Ar nós go leor eile sa tír, spreag an phaindéim deis dianmhachnaimh d’údaráis an stáisiúin agus d’eascair plean nua “Fís tar éis Covid” as an bpróiseas sin. “I ndáiríre, chuir sé go leor againn ag machnamh ar cén áit a bhfuil an Ghaeilge i súile an Stáit agus cén áit a bhfuil TG4 i súile an Stáit,” a dúirt Esslemont. Tá sé i gceist leis an bplean go gcuirfear béim ar sholáthar níos cuimsithí don lucht féachana - don óige ach go háirithe - chun cur le hinmharthanacht fhadtéarmach TG4 amach anseo. “Cuireann ár straitéis nua béim ar réimse clár agus réimse ábhar nach ndearna muid a ndóthain iontu [go dtí seo],” a dúirt ceannasaí TG4. “Tá mé ag cuimhneamh go háirithe ar an aos óg ag leibhéal réamhscoile, bunscoile, meánscoile agus suas go dtí aois 35.” Tá sé i gceist díriú isteach freisin ar an nuacht agus ar chúrsaí reatha. “Cé go bhfuil ardchaighdeán ar an méid atá ar bun againn faoi láthair, níl ár ndóthain á dhéanamh [maidir le cúrsaí nuachta] agus níl ár ndóthain á dhéanamh sa réimse digiteach. “Is ansin, ach go háirithe, atá an lucht féachana óg ag fáil a gcuid nuachta,” a dúirt sé. Ach, cé go mbeidh tacaíocht dhúthrachtach ón Stát de dhíth má táthar chun spriocanna nuálacha an stáisiúin a chomhlíonadh, bheadh luach saothair le fáil ar sin. De réir mheastachán TG4, tá luach níos mó ná €2 don gheilleagar ar gach €1 a infheistíonn an stáisiún i dtionscail na cruthaitheachta. Bhí teacht isteach de €40.3m (ca €37m de sin ón stát) ag TG4 anuraidh. Infheistíodh 77 faoin gcéad de sin in ábhar Gaeilge. Caitheadh €25.8m ar sheirbhísí cruthaitheacha agus caitheadh €21m de sin ar chomhlachtaí cruthaitheacha atá lonnaithe sna réigiúin. Tá an stáisiún ar an bpríomhfhoinse mhaoinithe ar earnáil an closamhairc sna réigiúin lasmuigh de Bhaile Átha Cliath agus Cill Mhantáin. Meastar go gcothaíonn TG4 thart ar 420 post san earnáil faoi mar atá agus ceaptar go dtiocfadh fás mór ar seo le hinfheistíocht bhreise. Chomh maith leis an mbuntáiste a bheadh ann maidir le breis ábhar seirbhíse poiblí i nGaeilge a bheith ar fáil, bheadh buntáiste fostaíochta ann freisin. “Ceann de na rudaí móra atá muid ag iarraidh a dhéanamh le Fís TG4 tar éis Covid ná infheistíocht a dhéanamh san earnáil agus go bhfeicfidh daoine óga go bhfuil deiseanna ann gur féidir gairm bheatha a bhaint amach a bheadh ag plé le cúrsaí teilifíse,” a dúirt Esslemont. Cothroime le RTÉ Fuair TG4 €4.2m de ardú breise sa cháinaisnéis is déanaí ach beidh gá le €9m nó €10m de ardú in aghaidh na bliana idir seo agus 2025 chun ‘Fís tar éis Covid’ a thabhairt i gcrích. D’fhágfadh sin go mbeadh maoiniú poiblí de € 78.6m á gcur ar fáil do TG4 faoi 2025. “Tá muid an-bhuíoch as an airgead breise a fuair muid i mbliana,” a dúirt an t-ardstiúrthóir. “Beidh muid in ann tús a chur le Fís TG4 tar éis Covid ach dáiríre caithfidh muid dul i dtreo cothroime i bhfad i bhfad níos fearr idir RTÉ agus TG4.” Agus téann sé sin go dtí cnámh na huillinne maidir le seasamh an stáisiúin i súile an stáit. “Ba cheart go mbeadh éagsúlacht agus iolrachas sna meáin phoiblí,” a dúirt Esslemont. “Ní mar sin atá éiceachóras na meán faoi láthair. [I gcomparáid leis an] méid atá ag TG4, tá ar a laghad an méid sin faoi dheich ag RTÉ. Luann Esslemont na h-acmhainní a fhaigheann S4C sa Bhreatain Bheag. Cuirtear £81.5m de chistí poiblí ar fáil in aghaidh na bliana agus faightear 515 uair a chloig de chláracha ón BBC. “Is scannal é nach labhraíonn daoine faoin chaoi nach dtugtar tacaíocht go háirithe do phobal labhartha na Gaeilge in Éirinn i gcomparáid le pobal labhartha na Breatnaise sa Bhreatain Bheag. “Tá muid ag iarraidh an díospóireacht sin a spreagadh. Tá an-jab déanta ag TG4 d’íomhá na Gaeilge go náisiúnta ach tá go leor, leor, eile ag teastáil chun tacú le pobal labhartha na Gaeilge.”",,2021-10-25 00:00:01,"FOCLÓIR: Ardán - platform; spleodrach - lively; tionscal cruthaitheach - creative industry; ré nua - new era; coibhneas - proportional relationship; closamharc - audiovisual; nuálach - innovative; éiceachóras - ecosystem; sclaigeach - potholed. ‘Sílim gur éirigh linn dul i bhfeidhm ar shochaí na tíre le branda TG4 ar bhealach nach raibh aon duine ag súil leis.” Sin a bhí le rá ag Alan Esslemont, Ardstiúrthóir ar TG4, agus é ag machnamh ar a bhfuil bainte amach ag an stáisiún náisiúnta Gaeilge, agus ceiliúradh 25 bliain ar aerthonnta na tíre ar na bacáin.

Chomh maith leis an mbuntáiste a bheadh ann maidir le breis ábhar seirbhíse poiblí i nGaeilge a bheith ar fáil, bheadh buntáiste fostaíochta ann freisin. “Ceann de na rudaí móra atá muid ag iarraidh a dhéanamh le Fís TG4 tar éis Covid ná infheistíocht a dhéanamh san earnáil agus go bhfeicfidh daoine óga go bhfuil deiseanna ann gur féidir gairm bheatha a bhaint amach a bheadh ag plé le cúrsaí teilifíse,” a dúirt Esslemont. Cothroime le RTÉ Fuair TG4 €4.2m de ardú breise sa cháinaisnéis is déanaí ach beidh gá le €9m nó €10m de ardú in aghaidh na bliana idir seo agus 2025 chun ‘Fís tar éis Covid’ a thabhairt i gcrích. D’fhágfadh sin go mbeadh maoiniú poiblí de € 78.6m á gcur ar fáil do TG4 faoi 2025. “Tá muid an-bhuíoch as an airgead breise a fuair muid i mbliana,” a dúirt an t-ardstiúrthóir. “Beidh muid in ann tús a chur le Fís TG4 tar éis Covid ach dáiríre caithfidh muid dul i dtreo cothroime i bhfad i bhfad níos fearr idir RTÉ agus TG4.” Agus téann sé sin go dtí cnámh na huillinne maidir le seasamh an stáisiúin i súile an stáit. “Ba cheart go mbeadh éagsúlacht agus iolrachas sna meáin phoiblí,” a dúirt Esslemont. “Ní mar sin atá éiceachóras na meán faoi láthair.

Read More",2021-10-24 10:00:05,"Article content It took all of about a half a day into my long-term test of the Outlander PHEV to understand why it is the country’s top-selling plug-in hybrid. Now that I’ve had a couple of weeks using the all-wheel-drive SUV for all manner of things on all manner of roads, my appreciation for it has only grown. Article content Sure, there are a few niggling things that I discovered over time — the seemingly random placement of drive mode buttons, the absence of a built-in NAV system — but in terms of being a comfortable, practical and, if managed properly, downright frugal compact crossover, the Outlander PHEV passes with flying colours. And with an all-in price under $50,000 for my tester, before rebates at that, it’s a very strong value for money proposition too. As to those rebates, there is the $2,500 federal one, and provincial ones in B.C. ($1,500), Quebec ($4,000), New Brunswick ($2,500), Nova Scotia ($2,500) and PEI ($2,500).

Long-term test introduction: 2022 Outlander PHEV Black Edition Back to video This model is the last of its generation, with an all-new plug-in Outlander coming next year as a 2023 model, promising more power and more all-electric range. It will also, no doubt, come with a new body style, one most likely similar to its fourth-gen, gas-powered stablemate. Increased engine output and range are most welcome; however, I’m not convinced the ‘new’ look — including somewhat demonstrative headlights — is an improvement over the current PHEV’s sleek and smooth exterior.

You may use a different browser or device to view this in full screen. OK That improvement to the power output of the Outlander PHEV continues what has been a steady march in that direction, as the 2021 model received a bigger engine — a 2.4-litre in place of the 2.0-litre — larger battery capacity — from 12 kWh to 13.8 kWh — and upgraded electric motors over the previous plug-in. That’s the same powertrain that is in my tester, with that four-cylinder putting out 126 horsepower and 149 lbs.-ft of torque. Dial in that electric power, however, and the combined power output is 221 hp, or 31 hp over the previous powertrain. And the electric range bumped up from 35 km to 39 km (but on that note, my first couple of weeks have seen a higher all-electric range. More on that in the second instalment of this long-term test drive in a couple of weeks). Article content Also new for 2021 are Sport and Snow driving modes integrated into Mitsubishi’s tried-and-true Super All-Wheel Control (S-AWC) all-wheel drive system. To engage these modes you simply press the Twin-Motor 4WD LOCK button to simulate locking of a centre differential and optimally distribute torque to all four wheels to maximize traction. What makes the Outlander PHEV stand out among most of its plug-in peers is the ability to use Fast Charging to juice up the battery pack, which takes about 25 minutes to replenish up to 80 per cent power. Other charging methods include using a standard outlet at home with a supplied charging cable, through brake regeneration, and through ‘Charge Mode’ which uses the gasoline engine to charge the battery (I’ll also report more on this latter system in the next instalment). Article content The low deck makes loading and unloading for a road trip easy, and despite being billed as a compact crossover, rear cargo space is SUV-like. Photo by Andrew McCredie What I’ve come to appreciate about the Outlander PHEV is that there is a lot going on with that powertrain, depending on which drive mode you are in, how you drive when in EV mode, and even how you use the five-level regen braking paddle shifters on the steering wheel. And the full-charge range has gone as high as 91 km, which I’m still trying to figure out. For all of that, I’m glad to have this vehicle longer than the typical week we get to test a new car out. However, my two weeks so far have revealed a few things about the Outlander PHEV. Most notably, how little gas I’ve used during my daily commute and errands. I’ve plugged it in every night in my car port, and by morning have a full charge. The rare occasions when I’ve gone further than 50 kilometres are the only times the gas engine has fired up. I made it from my home in North Vancouver to the Vancouver airport and back on electricity only — a round trip of 58 kilometres — with more than handful of clicks on the clock. I also did some off-road travel in the Outlander PHEV along some logging roads near Squamish, and the all-wheel-drive system performed as advertised — my only complaint being the gas-engined power output was not ideal for climbing up some of the steeper sections. However, the vehicle’s low centre of gravity — greatly aided by the battery pack — kept it pinned and stable to the ground, and provided a fairly high level of 4×4 confidence. Article content The official maximum electric range of the Outlander PHEV is just over 50 kilometres, but that changes depending on your driving style and driving conditions. Photo by Andrew McCredie In the coming weeks I hope to fill it up with passengers for some urban exploring, take my dog for some mountain hikes and dive deeper into the inner workers of that mysterious gas-electric powertrain. One final thing: on three occasions now I have been approached by Outlander PHEV owners in parking lots and on side streets asking me all kinds of questions. How long have I owned it? Did I have the previous generation model before this one? What’s the highest I’ve got the all-electric range to on the gauge? How much range do I think the next gen will have? Passionate is an understatement in describing their appreciation for the model, and to me that is a ringing endorsement of this vehicle. Needless to say, I’m looking forward to the next few weeks testing it out more.",,driving
Skullcandy Commits To Keeping One Million Pounds Of E-Waste Out Of Landfills,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jenniferhicks/2021/10/24/skullcandy-commits-to-keeping-one-million-pounds-of-e-waste-out-of-landfills/,"['Consumer Tech', '/consumer-tech', 'Innovation', '/innovation', 'Consumer Tech', '/consumer-tech', 'technology', 'jenniferhicksblog']","['Jennifer Kite-Powell', ' Senior Contributor']",,"Consumer electronics company, Skullcandy commits to keeping one million pounds of e-waste out of landfills by 2025 and it starts with upcycling.","Consumer electronics company, Skullcandy commits to keeping one million pounds of e-waste out of landfills by 2025 and it starts with upcycling.",2021-10-24 17:30:00,"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin A sculpture created out of e-waste in the likeness of Mount Rushmore and the G7 leaders on a hill in ... [+] Hayle, Cornwall, England, Wednesday, June 9, 2021. The sculpture, created by British artist Joe Rush ad sculptor Alex Wreckage, named Mount Recyclemore, aims to highlight the growing threat of e-waste. (AP Photo/Jon Super) ASSOCIATED PRESS According to the United Nations Global e-waste monitor, global e-waste volumes grew 21% between 2104 and 2019. in 2019, worldwide, there are more than 53.6 million tons of discarded e-waste. Based on this data, the report predicts that global e-waste will reach 74 megatons by 2030, doubling waste tonnage in 16 years, making e-waste the world's fastest-growing domestic waste stream. Jessica Klodnicki, Skullcandy CMO and head of the brand's sustainability task force says the consumer electronics industry has not educated consumers on the implications of their products' impact or given guidance on how to dispose of products at the end of life properly. Klodnicki says that because Skullcandy's target consumer is predominantly Millennial and Gen Z, the company started to know them better. “It was clear that they expect brands to solve significant issues facing the world, including climate change.” ""Sustainability in e-commerce often focuses just on production and logistics, but what comes after a product's lifecycle is being neglected,"" said Klodnicki. ""Once the product is with the customer, it's none of our business, right? Wrong. Businesses and consumers need to evolve and adapt circular economy programs to take recycling a step further."" Skullcandy's upcycle program was started in 2019 with a portion of proceeds from upcycled sales going to advance the causes championed by Protect Our Winters (POW), a climate advocacy organization. Three years later, the company has committed to keeping one million pounds of e-waste from landfills around the world by the close of 2025. MORE FOR YOU Google Issues Warning For 2 Billion Chrome Users Forget The MacBook Pro, Apple Has Bigger Plans Google Discounts Pixel 6, Nest & Pixel Buds In Limited-Time Sale Event “Consumers generate around 40 million tons of electronic waste every year worldwide, and only 12.5% of e-waste is recycled,” says Klodnicki. “This means the remainder of products is being discarded in landfills or sent to incinerators, which release harmful toxins into the air,"" Klodnicki said it was intimidating for the brand to acknowledge they were a small player contributing to the issue. ""We felt it was important to take ownership and action on the matter. We started the program in the US and Canada, partnering with a well-respected facility to handle the upcycling and proper recycling process,"" said Klodnicki. ""We took our learnings and expanded the program into Europe and the UK. Fast forward to 2021; we began doing extensive research around carbon offsets and becoming carbon neutral."" Klodnicki says Skullcandy is aware that this is an important, yet controversial subject. ""The research we found was complicated and often not congruent, but we felt and still feel that it is important for the company to work towards being carbon neutral as soon as possible,"" said Klodnicki. ""We chose to look at something we could effect immediately and set a large-scale goal around, which was withholding one million pounds of e-waste from landfills,"" said Klodnicki. ""We have the tools to track our impact (or lack of) and now have the information to further educate our retailers to partner with us in keeping products out of landfills,"" added Klodnicki. Since the launch of the Skullcandy circular commerce program, 439,216 units of product have been upcycled or recycled, which Klodnicki says equates to 458,450 pounds or close to 10,000,000 AA batteries of returned products withheld from landfills globally. ""Our new Grind Fuel and Push Active True Wireless Earbuds tackles this issue head-on by allowing over-the-air updates to consumers' earbuds, so consumers don't have to completely replace the hardware just because a new feature is available,"" added Klodnicki. By the close of 2021, Skullcandy says it also plans to have packaging exclusively utilize 100% recyclable packaging. And, by the end of 2023, the company will shift away from plastic to solely using FSC certified paper products. Klodnicki says the company hopes that more consumer electronics brands will recognize the severity of e-waste in landfills worldwide and prioritize being proactive versus reactive to the problem. ""We are being transparent about the initiatives and goals we have in place while also following our climate change partner's mission of progress over perfection,"" adds Klodnicki. In partnership with Carbon Checkout, Skullcandy launched a Carbon Checkout program on four of their global websites that encourage customers to offset their footprint on digital orders at the time of purchase. Klodnicki says that offsets in North America go towards a landfill gas capture project in Virginia, and international offsets fund a wind farm project in Bulgaria. But carbon offsets are not without controversy. In June 2021, Bloomberg reported on the dilemma of trying to decide what offsets should be traded and who can buy them. Shopify committed to investing at least $1 million each year into carbon sequestration ; Etsy announced in 2019 that it would pay for high-quality carbon offsets for consumers using its site. But Klodnicki says that since the launch of their program in August 2021, customers have already offset their purchase nearly 1,700 times. ""This means that Skullcandy's Carbon Checkout program hits above the industry standard, having achieved 11% redemption thus far.""",https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/0x0/filters%3Aformat%28jpg%29/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/617594e099d2aad2a31bf699/0x0.jpg,forbes

Asteroids and comets pummeling Earth delayed rise of oxygen,https://www.space.com/asteroid-comet-strikes-early-earth-oxygen,,,,"Remnants of ancient asteroids revealed Earth was bombarded by massive space rocks more often than previously thought, vastly altering oxygen levels in the planet's early atmosphere.",,2021-10-25 10:30:50,"Remnants of ancient asteroids revealed Earth was bombarded by massive space rocks more often than previously thought, vastly altering oxygen levels in the planet's early atmosphere. When Earth formed 4.6 billion years ago, it had almost no atmosphere. As the planet cooled, an atmosphere started to form , though it was mainly of carbon dioxide and nitrogen at first, which was inhospitable for life as we know it today. Eventually, Earth experienced a major shift in surface chemistry triggered by the rise of oxygen levels, also known as the Great Oxidation Event (GOE). Between 2.5 and 4 billion years ago, during the Archean eon, asteroids and comets often rained down on Earth. These space rocks (some of which measured more than 6 miles or nearly 10 kilometers wide) greatly impacted the chemistry of the planet's early atmosphere — especially the accumulation of oxygen, according to a new study. Related : Earth nearly lost all its oxygen 2.3 billion years ago The study found that asteroids and comets fell to Earth more often than previously thought and may have delayed when oxygen started to accumulate on the planet. Therefore, the new atmosphere models help scientists better pinpoint when Earth started to look like the planet it is today. ""Free oxygen in the atmosphere is critical for any living being that uses respiration to produce energy,"" Nadja Drabon, co-author of the study and a Harvard assistant professor of Earth and planetary sciences, said in a statement . ""Without the accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere we would probably not exist."" When an asteroid or comet collided with Earth, it created a giant vapor plume. Some of the vaporized rock in the plume would then condense and solidify, falling back to Earth to form a thin layer of sand-size particles, also known as impact spherules. It was not until recently that scientists discovered more of these tiny, ancient particles, which otherwise go unnoticed because they appear to be ordinary bits of rock. The researchers analyzed the rock particles to get a better picture of the total number of impact events that occurred in Earth's ancient past. The new models suggest early Earth endured an impact approximately every 15 million years, which is about 10 times more often than previous models estimated, according to the statement. Next, the researchers modeled how these meteorite impacts would have influenced Earth's atmosphere, revealing that repeated collisions of objects larger than 6 miles wide would have triggered an oxygen sink, which, in turn, would have sucked most of the oxygen out of the atmosphere, the researchers said. — Brilliant yellow-green fireball lights up sky above England (video, photos) — 32,000 mph fireball spotted soaring over North Carolina — Powerful Bering Sea fireball spotted from space in NASA photos Their findings align with current geological records that suggest the early Archean eon was characterized by relatively low oxygen levels. It was not until around 2.4 billion years ago, when impacts slowed, that oxygen levels in Earth's atmosphere increased, paving the way for life as we know it today. ""As time went on, collisions become progressively less frequent and too small to be able to significantly alter post-GOE oxygen levels,"" Simone Marchi, lead author of the study and a scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, said in a statement . ""The Earth was on its course to become the current planet."" The research is described in a paper published Thursday (Oct. 21) in the journal Nature Geoscience.

Unvaccinated tennis players could be allowed to play in Australian Open,https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/other-sports/unvaccinated-tennis-players-could-be-allowed-to-play-in-australian-open-1.4709963?localLinksEnabled=false,,,,"Unvaccinated tennis players could be allowed to travel to Melbourne and compete at the Australian Open, according to an email sent to WTA players that appears to contradict previous federal and state government advice. Last week the immigration minister, Alex Hawke, said players who were unvaccinated or would not reveal their vaccine status would not be allowed to enter Australia, placing world No 1 Novak Djokovic in doubt for the January tournament. Victoria recently introduced a vaccination mandate for all professional athletes, but the WTA Players Council has advised players on the women’s tour that they may be allowed to compete under certain conditions, including quarantining for 14 days, if they are unvaccinated. The leaked email to players said unvaccinated players would have to quarantine, arrive after December 1st and produce a negative test result within 72 hours of departure to be allowed entry. It would open the door to players such as Djokovic, who has refused to disclose his vaccination status, to appear at the grand slam at Melbourne Park. The Players Council said it had been in regular contact with Tennis Australia CEO, Craig Tiley, and were informed of the conditions at the end of last week. But the email conceded the issue was not “100% resolved yet”, and a further update from the governing body was expected on Friday. “We have been communicating regularly with Craig and the Tennis Australia team in recent months and they shared some good news with us on our Players Council call last Friday that we would like to share with you so that we know the facts and are not confused by the rumours that have been circulating,” the email said. “Tennis Australia has asked us to wait a few days before speaking about it as they were still working with the government on the details.” Restrictions for fully vaccinated players would be significantly improved from those at the tournament earlier this year, the email said, given Victoria’s vaccination rate is expected to hit 80 per cent at the end of the week and 90 per cent by next month. Those who have received two doses of the jab would be able to arrive any time after December 1st and not have to undertake a period of quarantine or live in a bio-secure bubble as they did in January this year . They would also have complete freedom of movement while in Melbourne. The conditions are in stark contrast with those endured at the tournament in Melbourne earlier this year, when several players complained about the conditions in mandatory hotel quarantine and their inability to fully prepare for the year’s first grand slam. It remains unclear whether players who are again forced to quarantine this time around would be willing to do so. Tennis Australia issued a statement on Monday afternoon to confirm it was working with the Victorian and federal governments on conditions for players and that details would be finalised soon. “Everyone has been buoyed by the easing of restrictions over the past week, along with the premiers announcement yesterday that large crowds will be welcomed back to events next year,” TA said in a statement. “We are optimistic that we can hold the Australian Open as close to pre-pandemic conditions as possible.” Victorian sports minister Martin Pakula said earlier in the day that the situation was still evolving. “I don’t want to put the cart before the horse,” Pakula told Melbourne radio station 3AW. “We’re still talking to the feds and that will play out over the next two or three weeks. “And it will be done in plenty of time for all of the players to know what the requirements are and for those who aren’t vaccinated to get vaccinated. “We are still resolving with Tennis Australia and the Commonwealth the question of whether unvaccinated foreign nationals will be allowed into Australia at all and, if so, under what circumstances.” Despite the easing of restrictions in Victoria by the end of next month, on Sunday the premier, Daniel Andrews, reiterated the federal government’s position that “if you’re not vaccinated, you’re not getting in”. On Wednesday last week, the immigration minister said it was unlikely tennis players would be given exemptions. “Not at this time.

Hertz also announced plans to install thousands of chargers throughout its network to support the increase in EVs, in addition to a “premium and differentiated rental experience” for customers renting a Tesla that includes educating drivers on how to use and charge the car. Customers who rent a Tesla Model 3 will also have access to Tesla’s supercharging stations, infrastructure that is already under pressure in some locations as sales of the Tesla EVs skyrocket. Tesla shares rose more than 5% following the news, pushing the stock price to $960 shortly after the market opened. Hertz stock also saw an 11% increase, to around $27. Like other companies in the travel and tourism industry, Hertz had a rocky pandemic, with decreased rentals pushing the company to file for bankruptcy protection in May last year. The deal with Tesla comes just four months after Hertz emerged from bankruptcy, amidst a remarkable rebound for the rental car industry. Investment firms Knighthead Capital Management and Certares Management took over Hertz earlier this year.",2021-10-25 14:36:03,,,techcrunch

And no, Telesto did not cause it. I don’t think. I’m pretty sure. So, I was tagged roughly a zillion times yesterday regarding a video that had gone online about an extremely weird glitch that seemed to give players the ability to generate a ridiculous amount of orbs in PvP using the Titan bubble or Warlock well supers. The warnings here, I will give you up front. At best, Bungie is aware of this exploit/glitch and is tracking who is using it using a specific error code it may server them. At worst, this is something that could potentially get you banned, and there are reports of players being banned for using it. It’s called the Min/Max glitch, and involves putting the game into Windowed Mode, then hovering over the maximize button for five seconds. Pop the super and then it’s orb city. The weird thing is, this has been in the game for a long time. People have told me that this glitch was discovered some time this summer around July, and was already passed along to Bungie. What appears to have happened is that Bungie has been working on fixing this bug, which is supposed to be “nasty,” ever since, but they haven’t been able to crack it. So right now the temporary fix is hitting people with these RUTABEGA errors. There is no outright confirmation from Bungie that they are banning people who use it, and yet they can definitely track who is, and I wouldn’t rule it out. What’s happened now is that this player, JB3, published the glitch, so now Bungie had to comment on it publicly. Here’s what DMG had to say about it yesterday, responding to the original poster (who has reportedly been banned a few times for using/showing off things like this): MORE FOR YOU ‘Demon Slayer’ Season 2 Finally Has An Actual 2021 Release Date Netflix’s ‘Squid Game’ Season 2 Not A Sure Thing, Says Director ‘Genshin Impact’ Still Refuses To Increase Anniversary Rewards, Despite Fan Outcry So, the result of this glitch is nuts, it’s true. Instant supers for days. But if you use it, you are putting yourself at risk as Bungie is both extremely aware it exists and can track who is using it. You could just get the usual penalties repeated error codes give you, but push too hard, and I would not rule out a potential ban. So I would just avoid it completely. This has made Telesto bugs look tame, so let’s just stick with those, shall we? Telesto bolts now drop Bright Dust? That sounds like a nice, pleasant one. Someone work on figuring that out.

The Guardian reports that dozens of ships have been forced to float in the waters outside for ports for weeks now, as the Biden administration scrambles to unblock the bottleneck. “These issues go through the entire chain, from ship to shelf,” Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary, told ABC7. “That’s why we’re not just working with the ports. It’s the truckers, the rail companies, the operators and also those retail companies that are at the other end of those supply chains.” The port is now operating 24/7 following an order from the Biden administration last week.

Where’s the mystery here? Huawei watches are usually announced before they head to stores, but the Huawei Watch Fit Mini seems to have skipped that part. The watch is available from Amazon Germany for 99 Euro, roughly $115 in a direct conversion. However, there’s no word of a US release at present. At first glance the Huawei Watch Fit Mini seems like a narrower version of the Watch Fit. It’s only 25.9mm wide, and has a 1.47-inch AMOLED screen of 196 x 368 pixels. The Huawei Watch Fit Mini lacks GPS, though, so will not be as effective a run tracker as its bigger sister. There is also no mentioned of Connected GPS, where the watch takes location information from a connected phone, although other affordable Huawei watches do support this. Neat as the Huawei Watch Fit Mini looks, its positioning is somewhat awkward. The Huawei Watch Fit now tends to sell at well below its original price, making the mini appear less of a good deal that it might otherwise. It has an aluminium front casing, with plastic on the back, and sells with either a brown, purple or white strap. There’s a heart rate sensor on the rear, and 5ATM water resistance means you can wear a Huawei Watch Fit Mini while showering or swimming.

‘They went above and beyond’: Celebrating good customer service by Irish businesses,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/consumer/they-went-above-and-beyond-celebrating-good-customer-service-by-irish-businesses-1.4704571?localLinksEnabled=false,,,,"As keen readers will know, we spend much of our time on this page giving out. If we are not moaning about high prices we are complaining about terrible customer service. And we make no apologies for that. But every now and then it is worth acknowledging that amidst all the horror stories and the let downs there are many thousands of businesses and people who do the right thing and look after their customers. often when it doesn’t benefit them at all. They just do the right thing because they are sound. So, what with it being a bank holiday and all – and one which is always pretty depressing, heralding as it does the start of winter – we thought we would stand down our gripes for the day and hand the page over to those with good news stories to share. It’s time to celebrate the sound. Stena Line A reader by the name of John Daly was due to travel to UK with Stena Line earlier this month “I assumed that the ferry was departing at 20.55. Unfortunately that was the departure time for Irish Ferries crossing. Stena was departing at 20.30.” Around 25 minutes before the boat was due to set sail Daly’s phone rang. “I was on the M50 when I received a call. The lady asked me where I was. I replied that I was on the M50, near the port tunnel. She replied saying that ‘We will wait for you. Put your foot down’. I couldn’t imagine our biggest airline doing that. So 10 /10 for Stena. I was the last to board.” Maybe Daly was being a bit harsh on airlines when he said they’d not be so accommodating to dallying passengers. Because as it happens we also got a mail from a reader in connection with Aer Lingus, a company which has come in for its fair share of criticism on this page over recent years. Aer Lingus Shane Colton “felt compelled to send in my positive experience” with the airline because “there are so many examples nowadays of poor customer service so nice to be able to call out positives when possible!” Colton was heading to London a few weeks ago and he admits that it had been so long since he’d been on a plane that he was out of practice. Aren’t we all? “I decided there was no point going down to the gate too early and instead was relaxing over my pint in the bar. Needless to say I was cutting it a bit too ‘just in time’ and as I was strolling down to the gate, my name got called out over the intercom to go to the gate. Next thing the guy from the gate rang my mobile phone to check was I lost or if I was on my way (they could probably tell I had checked in),” he writes So after “putting an inch to my final step and being mortified at being last to board the plane, I now learned to not only check which gate your flying from, but the time the gate closes. I was deeply grateful to them for the gentle nudge as I highly doubt the other low-cost airlines would have done the same. Having to sit around the airport all day, rearranging alternative flights and costing a fortune would have lost me day one of my weekend trip and ultimately soured my weekend. I’m a big believer in customer service not being all high and fancy, it can be very small simple acts of kindness.” Irish Ferries We also heard from an Irish Ferries customer. It’s another company which has featured on this page in a less positive fashion of late. “Given the many problems that you have covered with refunds and vouchers for travel cancelled due to the pandemic, I wanted to report a recent, very positive experience with Irish Ferries,” says Bairbre Redmond. “In early 2020 I had paid €1,500 for a return Dublin-Cherbourg trip for June 2020. I cancelled the trip in May 2020 and opted to take a voucher rather than a refund. This was partly because the voucher was going to be good for travel up to the end of 2021 (when travel in that period looked to be a lot more viable than it turned out to be). As I was lucky enough to afford it, I also wanted to try and support Irish Ferries by leaving the money with them; we’ve travelled with them annually to France for 12 years and have always had very good experiences with them.” Fast forward to last spring when it became clear travel to France was not going to be a runner in the summer of 2021 either. “I began to think that my magnanimous gesture of taking a voucher might have been a bit foolish,” Redmond says. “I wrote to Irish Ferries asking if they would allow us to book travel for 2022 using the €1,500 voucher. Their subsequent reply did not say that it would be possible, but asked me to “revert back to us near end of 2021 and we can favourably review for extension of the travel credit, taking into consideration the value of credit you currently have held”. While hopeful, I had been increasingly nervous that Irish Ferries could still limit or refuse to honour the voucher as we wouldn’t be using it for travel in 2021.” The 2022 Ireland-France travel bookings opened last week and Redmond “prepared for a lengthy dispute to be able to use our voucher for a post-2021 booking. “I phoned them this morning and, with no issue, was told that I could use the entire amount against a 2022 booking and was helpfully talked through how to draw down the credit on an online booking. An hour later the Irish Ferries agent (Paula) phoned me back to make sure I had been able to complete this as she was concerned that she might have misled me on using one aspect of their (new) booking system. Credit where it’s due, an extremely positive experience (and an excellent booking agent). Apart from being a long-time customer with Irish Ferries, I have no other connection with the company.” Promise Gluten Free Sorcha King wanted us to highlight what she said was “a small gesture but [one which] made me feel important as a customer. King’s husband and son are both coeliac so the family spend a lot on gluten-free foods. “A few weeks ago I bought sandwich baps from Promise Gluten Free ( an Irish company based in Donegal). The baps were four days within the best-before date and still sealed but unfortunately had a patch of mould so I took a picture and emailed it to them,” she writes. “I got a lovely email back,” she says. The company accepted that there was an issue – it is one which is, King tells us much worse in warmer weather. “They apologised and asked for my address to send out a hamper in the post. A big box arrived a couple of days later filled with a large selection of their breads. I wasn’t expecting such a lovely hamper. It will stick with me the way they treated my complaint and I reach for their products when shopping.” First Stop Paul Doyle has not one but two good news stories he wanted us to share. First up was First Stop in the Omni Shopping Centre in Santry. “These guys always go further to make getting our three cars sorted. From tyres to batteries, full service to brakes, they are always friendly, search for best prices for parts. They keep you informed by phone and are apologetic when the bill is big because something needs to be done. The management and team always have time to explain and show you what needs to be done. And, they are friendly in a natural ‘Dub’ way. Every time for years now. Exceptional. And all of four of us have had the same individual experience.” Shouk Doyle also had a shout out for Shouk, the restaurant in Drumcondra. “They had a problem one evening, we had to wait 25 minutes for our online takeaway pickup. The team were totally apologetic, kept us informed of the likely delay and were polite and calm. They said they would be in touch. Two days later I got a call from them, explaining what happened, apologising again and hoping it would not affect our custom. Then, I was asked if I would give my email as they would like to sent me a small voucher. They sent a €15 voucher with a further apology. Their approach was friendly, efficient and clearly made us feel we were important to them. In both cases there is clearly a customer ethos from management down. Rare and natural in both cases.” Feeney’s of Dromore West Catherine Sheridan mailed us because she wanted to share a good experience she had with Feeney’s of Dromore West in Co Sligo. “I was involved with a local government management agency conference this week. I was speaking about the economic opportunities arising from climate change. I had hoped to make it to a hotel in time to give my presentation but I got my timings wrong,” she says. That makes her the third reader of this page this week to get their timings wrong. “We stopped at Feeney’s and explained our predicament. They sorted me with WiFi and set me up in their coffee shop where I was able to deliver my presentation. I’d like to I say to rapturous applause but it really wasn’t that sort of an audience. However it was incredible that I could. It was because of the attitude of the team in Feeneys. They went above and beyond for me and it was so, so brilliant.” Butternut Box Melanie Morris signed up to Butternut Box recently. It is a home-cooked, human-grade dog food and she had heard the business story and liked how they conducted themselves on various public platforms. “I ordered my first two-week batch late one evening using Apple Pay, which is connected to my Revolut card. I loved the service, Flumpy loved the food, I stayed on as a subscriber,” Morris says. “My payment didn’t go through this week (I should have switched to my more regular visa debit card), and they emailed me to politely let me know…. And that they would be sending by out my delivery anyhow, in the meantime.” She describes this attitude – rightly – as “really impressive. They also have a 24/7 vet nurse hotline for Butternutters, just like VHI for human members.” CliffRun Media Brigid Flanagan wanted to give a shout out to CliffRun Media. “My mother uses their Acorn, a tablet-like device for older people. She bought it during the first lockdown so she could keep in touch with people and watch mass/attend funerals virtually. It stopped working recently. We shipped it back to CliffRun Media. The long and short of it is that [the company] called today to let me know they can’t fix it but will provide her with a replacement, a refurbished one, at no charge.” Connolly Hospital Cian Conroy and a friend were knocked off their bicycles earlier this month – he chooses not to dwell on the driver’s role in the incident. “The extent of our injuries meant we both had to be rushed to A&E by ambulance and to then receive extensive treatment from the medical staff in A&E and the wider facilities in Connolly Hospital,” he says. “Everybody we encountered went out of their way not only to restore our bodies but also to lift our spirits. They were professional, attentive and courteous at every interaction. The staff were from every corner of the earth, New Zealand, South Africa, Nigeria, England and closer to home. I couldn’t name them all, and probably due to Covid masks I may not recognise them if we meet again, but would hope a name check of Blanchardstown A&E might in some way convey my thanks.” Done. Shout-outs “A few weeks ago in Tower Records I sat down on the stairs to breastfeed the baby... one of the staff members was over in about five seconds to see if I wanted a chair.” – Liz O’Sullivan “The staff at the checkout in Aldi Wexford are amazing when my husband, who has dementia, is trying to pay with pre-decimal coins.” – Patricia Stafford “Hairy Baby have a girl called Dee who’s just exemplary. Bought a load of t-shirts for presents, one had tiny hole in it. I was expecting big rigmarole to get replacement but after an email, a new one arrived in two days – no hassle, no stress. Presents were all a great hit.” – Orlaith Read “Dee from Hairy Baby also helped me out with a reprint of a t-shirt from over 10 years ago. So helpful and lovely.” – Aideen Nolan “Hilary from The Mill Pharmacy, Coolaney went out of her way to help me get my medication on time last week when I got discharged from hospital. Don’t know what I would have done without her.” – Jennifer Devaney Gaughan “We booked in for two nights in the Bloomfield Hotel with our two smallies in a family room. Had to leave after the first night (our own fault) and they refunded the second night. Amazing gesture, wasn’t expecting it at all. Fab hotel, fab pool, gorgeous location.” – Sara McGough. “Myself and a friend in Glengarriff for a weekend, booked a taxi back to cottage after meal, realised we had no cash, taxi driver didn’t take card – no ATMs open. He brought us home anyway as he didn’t want to see us stranded and walking in the dark – gent.” – Hazel Nolan “Sailed home on an overnight ferry with Stena Line. Noisy people in the lounge. Asked about paying to upgrade to the hygge lounge. Guy in customer service suggested an alternative and gave us a cabin free of charge. Was wowed by the service and totally not expecting that.” – Patricia Kirwan “DAA and Ryanair were magnificent in providing special assistance for my two elderly parents travelling with me to Faro [at the] end of September.” – Deborah Martin “My pharmacist from McCabes Pharmacy in Sandyford Hall in D18. She is nice anyway but this story is above all. I have apnoea and have to use purified water. It’s a five litre bottle. I ordered it during the week but was not well enough to collect it. I called this morning and asked if there was any chance the delivery van could drop it down. The delivery van must have been busy because my neighbour in the pitch dark ran into her, just now at 8pm, long after they closed, walking with the five litre bottle trying to find the number of my house. What a saint.” – Denis Crowley",,2021-10-24 23:00:00,"As keen readers will know, we spend much of our time on this page giving out.

How the Watch Word’s Most Enduring Designs Became Unisex Timepieces,https://robbreport.com/style/watch-collector/unisex-watches-1234642130/,"['Style', 'Watch Collector', 'Hermès', 'Louis Vuitton', 'Maison Margiela', 'Piaget', 'Rolex', 'Vacheron Constantin', 'Watches']",['dsimms29'],,"The sexiest watches are, by nature, sexless.",,2021-10-24 15:00:00,"These days, there’s no point in asking whether a watch is intended for ladies or gents—the answer, whether the watchmaker likes it or not, is “yes.” Fashion and jewelry are having big unisex moments, with men rocking pearl necklaces, pussy-bow blouses and platform heels even as designers, from Louis Vuitton ’s Nicolas Ghesquière to Maison Margiela ’s John Galliano, are cutting strong, broad-shouldered suits for anyone, male or female, who wants to wear them. And now the watch industry is catching up to its peers—and its clients. Perhaps noticing, as we have, that chic women are sporting everything from a massive Rolex to an F. P. Journe Souverain while many stylish men are discovering a penchant for smaller cases or diamond accents, watchmakers have begun branding models unisex or are avoiding labeling them at all. Interestingly, the same trend holds true for the most coveted and collectible vintage timepieces, though not because heritage brands were somehow unsung pioneers of gender fluidity—or at least, not purposefully. Classics become classics for a reason: because the design is as universally stylish as a fine cashmere sweater and can likewise be worn snug or oversized based on nothing more than personal preference. Today’s iconic models— Patek Philippe’s Nautilus , Audemars Piguet’s Royal Oak , Vacheron Constantin ’s Historiques American 1921 and Cartier’s Tank , for example—are as distinct in mid-30 mm form as they are in the 40s, with diamonds or without. And while each started life as a men’s watch, when the manufacturers began creating versions for women, they did so simply by shrinking the size instead of introducing clichés such as pastels, florals or froufrou rococo dials. Consider a modern, 35.2 mm Patek Philippe Nautilus Ref. 7118/1A , ostensibly for women. It isn’t far removed from its 40.5 mm moon-phase cousin, Ref. 5726/1A , and both look remarkably similar to the 42 mm original from 1976. Place any one of them on any wrist and it exudes the same good taste, but the specific message will vary slightly based on the size: A hefty watch on a woman, like an undersized watch on a man, has become a sign of quiet confidence. Patek Philippe’s 2021 Nautilus Collection Courtesy of Patek Philippe But for a style to transcend gender, it seems clear it first needs to stand the test of time—bold designs especially. Watchmakers are forced to chase trends just like any fashion-conscious designer, though they’ll never admit to it, which means you need to take the chorus of “instant classic” and “modern icon” claims with a grain of salt. How will those models fare, for example, compared with Jaeger-LeCoultre’s Reverso , celebrating its 90th anniversary this year, which has changed very little in the past century? At its inception in the Roaring ’20s, the Reverso was a fancifully practical, face-flipping sports watch, but in today’s more dressed-down era, it’s considered an Art Deco–inflected dress model appropriate even for eveningwear. The style never really changed—society did. With that kind of staying power, what difference could a minor detail like gender make? Of course, plenty of currently buzzy—and unisex—watch trends are about to appear tragically dated (looking at you, brightly colored ceramic cases) but there are a few new designs that have the potential to remain in demand for the long haul by buyers of both sexes: Bulgari’s Octo Finissimo , a large, ultralight and ultramodern beauty; Piaget ’s razor-thin Altiplano , so slim it can fit in your wallet’s credit card holder; and the Hermès Arceau L’Heure de la Lune Moonphase, a wildly cool interpretation of a centuries-old complication. Retailers say these models are flying off shelves and into vaults belonging to people of every gender. If nothing else, think of a model’s unisex potential as a bellwether of return on investment. A Cartier Crash , recently seen looking both surprisingly outré on rapper Kanye West and expectedly elegant on New York socialite and entrepreneur Lauren Santo Domingo, is a prime example: Last year, an 18-karat yellow-gold London version sold online at Sotheby’s for $225,000, well over double its top estimate of $90,000, and dealers say it’s nearly impossible to come by now. The latest green-dial Nautilus , Ref. 5711/1A, released in April, is already selling on the secondary market for roughly $360,000—more than 10 times its original retail price of $34,893. It’s an unusual but important lesson for watchmakers with strong brand DNA: The best way to keep pace with today’s fast-morphing cultural landscape is to not change much at all.

What should we expect from those upgrades? Our contention would be improved 60fps support along with a more graphics rich 30fps mode, tapping into hardware-accelerated ray tracing.

There's not much to share this week in terms of DF content discussion as we're under embargo on various projects but we look forward to sharing more on some truly special content we have in development, but it's straight on to Supporter Program Q+A and once again, we (obviously) recommend that you become involved! Joining us on the supporter program gives you pristine quality video downloads of our work, access to our awesome Discord (where most of the team regularly contribute) plus early access to DF Direct Weekly - all of our backers now get early access to the Direct every Saturday , which is nice! The show is also available as a podcast, available on a range of providers right here . There are some good questions this week: do movies have frame-pacing issues on TVs (yes - because 24Hz content does not divide equally into a 60Hz refresh) and is there anything users can do about it (yes there is!). We also had an interesting question as to whether DLSS is such a killer feature that it may make Microsoft and Sony jump ship from AMD - perhaps unlikely as the Xbox team is already working on its own ML-based upscaler and because beefed up machine learning features in general will inevitably form a part of future hardware. Do we have 'favourite' temporal anti-aliasing solutions, or which early implementations impressed us most? TAA is effectively a standard in console gaming now, but it's actually been with us a long, long time - and there are some very interesting early examples. And we also tackle a question that comes up quite a lot: why don't we make shorter videos and more of them? That's the show for this week - and I hope you enjoy it.

Conference seeks to build interest in space among elected officials,https://spacenews.com/conference-seeks-to-build-interest-in-space-among-elected-officials/,"['IAC', 'IAF']",['Jeff Foust'],,An international group of elected officials is using a conference this week to build awareness about the importance of space among other politicians. SpaceNews,,2021-10-25 02:13:22,"DUBAI, U.A.E. — An international group of elected officials is using a conference this week to build awareness about the importance of space among other politicians. The International Astronautical Federation’s 72nd International Astronautical Congress, taking place this week here, included as one of its side events the 11th International Meeting for Members of Parliaments, attracting about 40 individuals from 15 countries. While this was the eleventh such meeting, it took on a new format this year. “In the past it was speeches from big companies or space agencies,” said Dominique Tilmans, an IAF vice president and former member of the Belgian Senate, during a press conference about the meeting Oct. 24. “We decided to reshape the meeting by asking parliamentarians to make presentations about space applications.” That new focus, she said, was intended to get them to think more about the benefits of space. “Our goal is to interest more and more parliamentarians in the space sector,” she said. “Our goal is to space understandable and accessible.” The meeting included sessions on the use of space for health, mobility and public services, with attending parliamentarians giving presentations on uses of space in their countries. “Some parliamentarians, before coming to the meeting, were not especially interested in space,” Tilmans said. “What we saw was enthusiasm: they understand space is so powerful, so interesting. So, they begin to become very interested in space.” Some participants were already interested in space, including one person who had flown in space. “We have to see the problem from the perspective of applications or solutions from space,” said Marcos Pontes, Brazil’s minister of science, technology and innovation, who flew to the International Space Station in 2006. “We can work together to find out how we can use the infrastructure we have, or other countries have.” The meetings discussed best practices about space applications in various fields. It did not, though, go into detail about legal and regulatory issues, including on topics like orbital debris that pose a growing risk to the ability to deliver those space applications. “There are so many things to discuss, and this is our first meeting in this new version,” Tilmans said. “This time we decided to discuss practical solutions, space solutions.” Pontes suggested it might be a topic for future meetings. “Space debris is a really important issue,” he said. “This is part of our concerns about the law of space, and how we can work together as countries to get legislation that would be effective.”",,spacenews

The underestimated impact of vapor pressure deficit on terrestrial carbon cycle,https://phys.org/news/2021-10-underestimated-impact-vapor-pressure-deficit.html,,,,"This study is led by Dr. Bin He (College of Global Change and Earth System Science, Beijing Normal University) and Dr. Wenping Yuan (School of Atmospheric Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University).

Traditionally, atmospheric temperature or land water availability have been considered as the two dominant drivers of interannual variability of global terrestrial carbon sink. In 2019, Wenping Yuan's group observed an apparent shift in global vegetation growth from greening to browning in the 1990s, and attributed this shift to the sharp increase in vapor pressure deficit (VPD). Inspired by this study, Bin He proposed that VPD should regulate the global terrestrial carbon cycle to a significant extent, which has been ignored by previous studies.

Bin He immediately contract with Wenping Yuan and discussed this idea with him. ""This is exciting, but more evidences are needed to test this speculation,"" Wenping Yuan said. The two groups cooperated and conducted a large amount of data analysis. They explored the impact of VPD on terrestrial ecosystem productivity observed by satellite remote sensing and terrestrial carbon fluxes from independent modeling approaches. Finally, they confirmed the significant impact of VPD on global terrestrial carbon cycle. ""Our original proposal turned out to be true,"" Bin He says. Future climate change, especially the increase of global atmospheric temperature, will promote VPD consistently. A greater regulation of VPD on terrestrial ecosystem productivity can be expected. ""However, current Earth system models underestimate the interannual variability in VPD and its impacts on global terrestrial productivity, preventing a reasonable projection of future global carbon cycle .

That means, for a start, providing far greater climate adaptation financing to low-income countries and plugging the holes that siphon their limited fiscal resources to tax havens. Two Canadians have prominent roles at the COP26 climate meeting in Glasgow, Scotland . United Nations Ambassador Bob Rae, is co-chair of the COP26 finance panel, and Mark Carney is the UN special envoy for COP26, responsible for getting financial institutions to join the new Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net-Zero . They are experienced and highly respected individuals with solid reputations as mediators. However, despite Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's recent climate plan, Canada's record on greenhouse gas emissions reduction has been abysmal . Furthermore, its failure to meet its climate finance commitments to developing countries will not be viewed favorably as Ambassador Rae attempts to negotiate a meaningful international climate agreement. The UN says more than 160 financial firms are signed onto the alliance . The ""Big Six"" Canadian banks—BMO, CIBC, National Bank, RBC, Scotiabank and TD—signed on days before the summit was to begin. Their pledge will undoubtedly be met with allegations that this was merely a public relations exercise. Since the Paris deal was signed in 2015, Canada's five largest banks have provided $700 billion in financing to fossil fuel companies . Canada, one of the worst carbon emitters Canada is, historically, the 10th largest carbon emitter and the worst contributor to carbon emissions on a per capita basis. The federal government has committed to reducing carbon emissions to 45 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. However, it has not committed to end fossil fuel company subsidies or provide an end-date for fossil fuel production, despite the urging of the UN secretary general to hold the line . Low-income countries are tiny emitters of greenhouse gases, least responsible for climate change, yet bearing its worst consequences. In the past 15 years, 90 percent of deaths from heat wave-related disasters have occurred in low- and middle-income countries . The UN refugee agency estimates that 21.5 million people are displaced by climate change-related disasters every year. For these countries, adaptation, not mitigation, is the overriding priority. Create zero-interest loans Twelve years ago, at the Copenhagen summit, rich countries promised to provide developing countries US$100 billion a year in climate finance by 2020. They have yet to meet this target . Canada has contributed less than 20 percent of its fair share . Even with the Trudeau government's promise to double climate financing to US$4.2 billion over five years, US$840 million per year, this is still only 24 percent of its fair share. The Group of 78 , of which I am a member of the executive, has called for a quadrupling of Canada's financing commitment as a bare minimum. Moreover 80 percent of rich country financing is in the form of loans, increasing the stress on countries already struggling to manage their debt burdens. International Monetary Fund-created money, or special drawing rights , which is allocated to countries based on their economic size, is largely unused by rich countries. Although discussions are ongoing, there has been no commitment to recycle these funds into zero-interest loans to low-income countries. Tax havens harm climate action Tax havens have disproportionately siphoned off wealth from low-income countries , a post-Second World War legacy of former colonies gaining independence that prompted the exit of colonial wealth via the proliferation of tax havens. Their losses have been accentuated during the pandemic. According to a report by the tax justice network these countries are losing the equivalent to more than half of their yearly public health budgets due to the shifting of multinational corporations profits to tax havens . The loss is equivalent to eight percent of rich countries' health budgets. More than 130 countries, including Canada, have reached an agreement, co-ordinated by the OECD, that would establish a minimum of 15 percent corporate tax to restrict tax avoidance and evasion . However, it has been sharply criticized as being rife with loopholes and carveouts. Oxfam accused it of pandering to corporations, having ""practically no teeth"" and offering no revenue for the world's poorest countries. Tax havens are enabled by an infrastructure of lawyers, accountants and bankers, including some from Canada. Rich countries' efforts to restrict and bring greater transparency to international tax rules have largely fallen short. Even by that standard Canada has been a laggard. The Liberal government recently increased the investigative resources of the Canada Revenue Agency and promised in its most recent budget to address cross-border tax avoidance and evasion schemes. How effective these will be in reining in these actions by wealthy individuals and corporations; past inaction does not bode well going forward. Carney will have his work cut out for him if, or when, he addresses these issues at COP26. No more blah, blah, blah To its credit, Canada, along with several other developed countries, is a member of the High Ambition Coalition , a group at the UN talks comprising many of the poorest and most vulnerable developing countries. But good intentions and empty promises will not pass muster. We don't need more ""blah blah blah,"" to quote Greta Thunberg. The UN Human Rights Council recently recognized access to a clean and healthy environment as a fundamental right and established a special rapporteur on the human rights impacts of climate change . These developments have the potential to make major emitting companies, including Canada's, legally liable for human rights violations arising from climate change. Hopefully, this will put additional pressure on rich countries to get serious about climate financing, debt restructuring and development funding for poor nations. Inaction is a luxury we can no longer afford. Explore further This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

From unjustified terminations to losing benefits with no warning, the employees inside the warehouse and the ones administering the leaves found themselves on the brink of burnout and sacrificing their lives to make up for countless HR issues related to paid and unpaid leave. Employees struggled to reach case managers, and doctor’s notes seem to simply disappear as paychecks were docked. To add to the dysfunction, Amazon’s team didn’t have any policies to accommodate local laws like one in its home state. An employee filing for unpaid leave under a Washington state legal protection of domestic violence victims was terminated from the company for missing deadlines. The Washington state attorney general that took on her case called her termination a “failure” and retaliation that violated state law, according to the NYT.

Christina Hammock Koch: Record-breaking NASA astronaut,https://www.space.com/christina-koch,,,,"Christina Koch grew up in North Carolina and always wanted to be an astronaut. Here's how she achieved her dream, and so much more.",,2021-10-25 21:46:53,"On Jan. 9, 2020, NASA astronaut Christina Koch celebrated her 300th day in space aboard the International Space Station (ISS). By the time she landed back on Earth on Feb. 6, she had broken the record for the longest time spent in space by a woman. That's not the only historic achievement for the astronaut. Just a few months prior, Koch and another woman astronaut, Jessica Meir, completed the first all-woman spacewalk . The spacewalk made ""sure that NASA was really committed to, like I like to say, answering humanity's call to explore by everyone,"" Koch told Space.com a year after the momentous event. ""And so it was just a wonderful thing to have the honor to participate in. And I think that we're just so appreciative still to receive the support that we still receive every day about it,"" she said. Related: Women in space — A Gallery of firsts Koch was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan and grew up in Jacksonville, North Carolina. From a young age, she wanted to be an astronaut, and joined her middle school's ""Rocket Club."" Trips to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida only solidified that dream, she told Jon Evans on his podcast . Koch attended North Carolina State University in Raleigh and completed a bachelor's in electrical engineering as well as a bachelor's in physics. She then completed a Master's in electrical engineering. After completing her degrees, Koch joined NASA as an electrical engineer at the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in Greenbelt, Maryland. While at GSFC, Koch worked in the Laboratory for High Energy Astrophysics on instruments for several space science missions. After her time at GSFC, Koch worked in Antarctica at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station and Palmer Station. From there, she returned to her electrical engineering roots and worked at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, contributing to instruments on the Juno spacecraft and Van Allen probes. In 2013, Koch was selected as a member of NASA's 21st astronaut class. After six years of intense training, she launched on her first space mission to the ISS on March 14, 2019 from Baikonur Cosmodrome on a Soyuz spacecraft . She was joined by astronaut Nick Hague and Russian Cosmonaut Alexey Ovchinin. Related: How to become an astronaut In her tenure on the ISS, Koch served as a flight engineer on expeditions 59, 60 and 61. While aboard the ISS, Koch worked on several scientific studies that covered human biology, Earth science, technology development and more. She also completed three all-woman spacewalks out of her six total spacewalks , spending a total of 42 hours and 15 minutes in the vacuum of space. Oct. 18, 2019, wasn't originally supposed to be a historic day. The first woman spacewalk was supposed to occur on March 29th, but an issue with space suit sizes delayed that plan. NASA's space suits are a marvel of engineering — they're essentially tiny, human-shaped spaceships. The most important part of the spacesuit is a hard plastic torso piece that holds the electronics that control all the suit's systems. An ill-fitted spacesuit can lead to serious safety issues, and reconfiguring the suit can take up to 12 hours. Koch and her colleague Anne McClain were scheduled to participate in a spacewalk together, but there was only one spacesuit made to fit McClain or Koch, so McClain swapped places with her colleague Nick Hauge so that Koch could wear the one spacesuit that fit both women. Related: Astronauts won't make the 1st all female spacewalk afterall By October, the crew had reconfigured another suit to fit Jessica Mier, who then joined Koch on the first all-woman spacewalk . For more than seven hours, the pair worked on replacing a battery charge/discharge unit that failed to activate after new lithium ion batteries were installed. Koch returned to Earth on Feb. 6, 2020, after having spent 328 days in space, setting the record for the longest space mission by a woman . She returned just as the Covid-19 pandemic was beginning and Americans were preparing for the possibility of a wide-spread quarantine. But coming back to a world on the cusp of a pandemic didn't feel as isolating it could have for Koch, she told Boston's WBUR radio. ""You know, being under stay-at-home orders really for me has actually offered a lot more than the isolation that I experienced for 11 months on board the International Space Station … it's allowed me to really get comfortable with my home life, to reintegrate in my home and in my neighborhood,"" she said. Related: NASA astronaut Christina Koch reflects on 1-year anniversary of first all-woman spacewalk Space travel has traditionally been designed for men. The physical embodiment of that fact is NASA's space suits, which had been designed with a man's physique in mind, not a woman's. Koch's participation in the first all-woman spacewalk was a ground-breaking accomplishment for female astronauts and all non-male people around the world, alike. ""Men's physiology, perspectives, values, measurements, comfort and ambitions have mostly been the default template for designing major human endeavors. I believe that Koch and Meir, by their sheer skill and execution, shift us closer to a template based on intelligence, agility, capability, integrity, courage and excellence,"" Mae Jemison, a fellow female astronaut, wrote about the pair in Time magazine's ""The 100 most Influential People of the Year"" feature . In December 2020, Koch was selected as one of the astronauts who will journey to the Moon on NASA's Artemis missions . That means she could be one of the first — if not the first — woman to step foot on the moon. ""To me, what [Artemis] really represents is that NASA is committed to answering humanity's call to explore by all and for all. We're an example of how you're most successful when you take contributions from every single part of the world, and the planet and humanity,"" Koch told Raleigh, North Carolina's CBS17 about the selection.",http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kFcFrjxrSCaPQLDoAFBaW4.jpg,space

Facebook is spending at least $10 billion this year on its metaverse division,https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745381/facebook-reality-labs-10-billion-metaverse,,['Jacob Kastrenakes'],,,"Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge Facebook plans to spend at least $10 billion this year on Facebook Reality Labs, its metaverse division tasked with creating AR and VR hardware, software, and content. “We are committed to bringing this long-term vision to life and we expect to increase our investments for the next several years,” the company writes in its third-quarter earnings release this afternoon. Facebook sees AR and VR as being core to “the next generation of online social experiences.” A sign that Reality Labs should be judged separately from Facebook’s core apps The division, which already makes the Oculus Quest headset and Portal lineup of calling devices, is clearly being positioned as the next big thing inside of Facebook. For one, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been talking about the metaverse nonstop for the past several months. And today, Facebook said it’s going to begin reporting earnings specifically for its Reality Labs segment, while Facebook’s main ads business — a staggering $28 billion this last quarter alone — will be reported under another bucket. It’s a sign to investors that the Reality Labs business matters and should be judged separately from how they value Facebook today. It’s also a move to, perhaps, distract from what else is going on in Facebook’s earnings today. The company missed revenue expectations by around $1 billion (this is not a lot, exactly, at Facebook’s scale), which speaks to some of the company’s struggles right now. Facebook blames a number of factors for this: COVID-19, the economy, and Apple’s recent ad-tracking changes — something we saw last week when Snap reported earnings, too. Apple updated iOS in April with a new privacy feature that requires users to actively opt in to allow apps to track them across other apps and websites. Initially, social media companies said they weren’t certain how much it would impact their ads businesses, which rely on that tracking in part to measure the efficacy of ads. It’s been a rough few weeks for Facebook. A series of stories in The Wall Street Journal detailed significant missteps by the company, including moderation issues and concerns about younger users’ mental health; the whistleblower who leaked those documents then testified before Congress; and just this morning, dozens of stories were published by a consortium of news outlets, including The Verge, covering even more problems for Facebook, including worries about declining usage among teens. Also, in the middle of all of that, Facebook’s apps were all down for a good chunk of a day in early October. None of that is mentioned in Facebook’s earnings release today. But it is the context behind these investments and changes. If the Facebook brand and apps are going to come with this kind of baggage, the company would like to push toward something new where, just maybe, it can escape all that.",2021-10-25 21:06:10,,,theverge

The Record reports that Facebook filed the lawsuit in the US District Court for the Northern District of California on Oct. 21. The company alleges in the filing that the defendant, Alexander Alexandrovich Solonchenko, abused a Facebook Messenger feature from January 2018 to September 2019 to scrape information about 178 million users from its servers. The feature in question is called Contact Importer. ""Between in and around June 2015 and September 2019,"" Facebook says in the filing , ""Messenger Contact Importer included a functionality that would return a one-to-one list of any Facebook users that matched phone numbers uploaded from the address book on a user’s mobile device ('CI matching function')."" Facebook says that Solonchenko ""used a computer program to deliver automated requests to Facebook computers, meanwhile pretending to be multiple Android devices connected to Facebook’s Messenger mobile app,"" so he could abuse Contact Importer to collect people's Facebook IDs and phone numbers. That data was then sold on a well-known crime forum. This isn't the first time Contact Importer was identified as the source of personal information about Facebook users. Someone else leaked the names, locations, and phone numbers, among other things, of 533 million people from 106 countries in April. That data was also scraped by abusing Contact Importer, which means the feature enabled at least two large-scale leaks. Contact Importer was changed several times to combat scraping attempts. Facebook says it ""set limits for the number of contacts that could be uploaded through Messenger Contact Importer and the frequency at which those phone numbers could be submitted"" in February 2018, and as of September 2019, it ""no longer returns one-to-one lists of matched phone numbers."" Facebook says in the filing that it's seeking injunctions against Solonchenko to prevent him from accessing its products or selling information gathered from them in addition to ""damages in an amount to be determined at trial,"" pre- and post-judgment interest, and ""all other equitable or legal relief the Court deems just and proper.""",https://sm.pcmag.com/pcmag_in/news/r/report-fac/report-facebook-sues-ukrainian-for-selling-data-about-178-mi_3wae.jpg,pcmag

The possible exoplanet candidate was spotted in the spiral galaxy Messier 51 (M51), according to a statement by the observatory . The observatory was monitoring X-rays coming from a binary star system in M51 when they saw dimming in the X-ray source, a strong indication of a planetary transit. ""We are trying to open up a whole new arena for finding other worlds by searching for planet candidates at X-ray wavelengths, a strategy that makes it possible to discover them in other galaxies,"" said Rosanne Di Stefano, from Harvard University and the Smithsonian Institute's Center for Astrophysics and the lead author of the study published today in Nature Astronomy. The system itself isn't any old star system though. Astronomers suspect that the X-rays are the product of either a neutron star or even a black hole that is feeding off its partner star, making this planet even more intriguing. Thousands of possible exoplanets have been spotted in our own galaxy, and over 150 have been confirmed. The most common method for identifying exoplanet candidates is the transit method, which is when you look at the amount of light being radiated by a star and watch for dips in the star's brightness. This would indicate that something passed in front of the light source, and if there is a regular period to the dips in the light seen from the star and the dip is of same magnitude, then you can confirm that there is a planet in orbit around that star. The exoplanet candidate spotted in M51 was seen in the same way, only instead of using visible light as with our current transit method for stars nearer to us, this method used X-ray emissions instead. The X-ray emissions are coming from either a neutron star or a black hole orbiting a larger star in a binary system. The companion star is estimated to have about 20 times the mass of the sun and is feeding the accretion disk around its partner, which is emitting the X-rays that the astronomers were able to observe. During their observation, they saw the X-ray emissions stop entirely for about 3 hours, which – along with other data – could indicate a Saturn-sized planet transiting in front of X-ray source at a distance of about twice Saturn's distance from the sun. This was only the first diminution of X-rays spotted though, so its too soon to say whether this is a planet or not – and confirmation could take decades. The researchers calculated that the planet's orbital period would be about 70 years, based on its size and distance. ""Unfortunately to confirm that we're seeing a planet we would likely have to wait decades to see another transit,"" said Nia Imara, of the University of California at Santa Cruz and co-author of the study. ""And because of the uncertainties about how long it takes to orbit, we wouldn't know exactly when to look."" While exciting in itself, this new method of detecting planetary transits in binary systems offers another method for spotting exoplanets here in our own galaxy. Since the X-ray emitting region of an accretion disk in these systems is small, a planet could completely block the X-ray source entirely, which is a much clearer indicator of a transit than measuring often subtle changes in the luminosity of a star. It should also be said that the planets spotted using this method would also have suffered through some pretty turbulent times. The collapse of a star into a neutron star or black hole isn't the most peaceful of transitions, and the the supernova that created them would have blasted the planet with some extreme radiation levels that would almost certainly stripped it of any life that might have been living on it. Then there's also the matter of the other star in the system. It hasn't gone supernova yet, but the steady loss of its material to its companion means that its demise is accelerating, so it would only be a matter of time before it too went supernova, blasting the planet again. Life in these systems is highly unlikely to say the least. Still, the X-ray transit method could prove useful in growing our catalog of planets outside our solar system.",,techradar

Apple AirPods Review: A Much-Needed Redesign,https://hypebeast.com/2021/10/apple-airpods-review-cost-release-date-spatial-audio-compares-airpods-pro-max-audio-quality-info,"['Tech', 'Features']",,,"Apple announced a long-awaited update to the AirPods at its Unleashed event earlier this month.The AirPods (3rd generation) -- Apple's first major redesign of its popular flagship wireless earbuds -- introduces an entirely new look, in addition to adding in great like spatial audio and Adaptive EQ borrowed from the AirPods Pro and AirPods Max, alongside longer battery life.Most striking is the new design of the AirPods, which offers a shorter stem and a larger earpiece that is less prone to slipping out of your ears during an intense running session (a longstanding gripe of AirPods users). The more snug fit also means the audio quality is less disturbed by the outside environment, making sounds more crisp and direct. To create the new contoured shape, Apple took thousands of ear scans and measurements, in-depth studies of acoustics and heat mapped modeling to create a lightweight and intentional earpiece that is optimized for comfort. The stem also features a force sensor -- a feature of the AirPods Pro that users find intuitive -- that allows for easier maneuvering between songs right from the buds. And the AirPods and its case now also have a greater sweat and water resistance rating of IPX4, just like the AirPods Pro.Major enhancements have also been made to the audio quality -- a feature that is crucial for a great pair of headphones. Apple has introduced a custom driver and high dynamic range amplifier to create richer bass and smooth high frequencies. The voice quality has been improved to optimize voice clarity during phone calls, with an inset microphone embedded in each earbud that is covered in a special acoustic mesh to reduce wind noise. In addition, they also feature AAC-ELD, a superior codec that allows for full-HD voice quality.Fan-favorite spatial audio with dynamic head tracking has been added to the new AirPods, which uses advanced spatial audio algorithms to provide theatre-like sound. The result is rich and layered audio that sounds like it's coming from all around you, definitely an upgrade most noticeable when watching movies, listening to music or when speaking on a group chat. The device utilizes a powerful H1 chip and employs Adaptive EQ to customize the listening experience for each user, while an inward-facing microphone has been added to each bud to listen to the sound emerging from the device and automatically tune the low-and-mid frequencies to the user's ear shape in real-time.In addition, Apple has expanded the device's battery life with up to 6 hours of listening from a single charge -- an hour upgrade from the previous generation -- and has introduced MagSafe charging for the case for even more charging options.And like the previous models, AirPods include delightful features like one-tap setup, in-ear detection using an all-new skin detect optical sensor, beamforming microphones, audio sharing, Siri and Find My built right into the device.The AirPods (3rd generation) will be available for $179 USD in-store and online beginning Tuesday, October 26.

Assessing seismic activity near site of planned city NEOM,https://phys.org/news/2021-10-seismic-site-city-neom.html,,,,"The potential for major earthquakes around the southern end of the Gulf of Aqaba may be lower than geophysicists feared. Separate studies by two students, using quite different approaches but arriving at similar findings, give hope that there will be low risks for emerging cities on the nearby shores of the Red Sea.",,2021-10-25 13:00:09,"The potential for major earthquakes around the southern end of the Gulf of Aqaba may be lower than geophysicists feared. Separate studies by two students, using quite different approaches but arriving at similar findings, give hope that there will be low risks for emerging cities on the nearby shores of the Red Sea. The Dead Sea Transform fault spans roughly 1200 kilometers from the Red Sea north to Turkey, and written records show it has produced many devastating earthquakes over the last 2,000 years. However, there has been little study of seismicity in the sparsely populated region around the southern part of the fault, where the Gulf of Aqaba meets the Red Sea. ""This area is now of great interest to Saudi Arabia because they are building the future megacity of NEOM very close to the Gulf of Aqaba,"" says geophysicist Sigurjón Jónsson from KAUST. ""They also want to build the King Salman road crossing across the Gulf to Sharm El Sheikh."" In 1995, a 7.2 magnitude quake struck the northern Gulf. The impact of an earthquake of such magnitude beneath the proposed crossing would be disastrous, so it is essential that engineers understand the seismic hazard in the region. Xing Li and Nicolás Castro-Perdomo, Jónsson's research students, led separate studies of plate motion around the Gulf of Aqaba. Both students used satellite geodesy, a universal framework for measuring the precise location of points on Earth. By observing how reference points on the surface move over time, geophysicists can study the deformation of tectonic plates and observe how rapidly stress and strain is building around fault lines. ""Estimating how fast elastic energy builds up gives us crucial information on how frequently, and how large, earthquakes might be,"" says Perdomo. Perdomo used a network of more than 40 global positioning system (GPS) stations on the ground around the Gulf and modeled the tectonic deformation from their positions in 2015, 2017 and 2019. Conversely, Xing Li used Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) imagery, produced by satellites bouncing radar signals off the Earth's surface, to measure plate motion. However, InSAR imagery from polar-orbiting satellites does not capture north-south motion. ""By focusing on areas where the satellite images overlap, where common signals cancel out, we could retrieve the north-south displacement,"" explains Li. She used more than 300 satellite images collected between 2014 and 2020 to create multiple 160-kilometer-long profiles of plate motion around the Gulf. Both studies found the Arabian side of the fault has been moving steadily northwards at around five millimeters per year. However, they noted a greater near-fault velocity to the south of the Gulf, which they attribute to the Earth's crust thinning, thereby creating less friction towards the Red Sea. Perdomo used existing models of crustal deformation to interpret their observations. ""The rapid near-fault velocity gradient implies that the southernmost fault could be steadily sliding along without producing major earthquakes ,"" he says. Both methods have proven reliable, yet GPS surveys remain labor intensive and expensive. ""We've found an efficient and low-cost way to gather vast quantities of data that enable us to calculate even very slow horizontal displacement along a north-south fault, without doing any fieldwork,"" says Li. ""There is uncertainty within each method, and lots of assumptions had to be made,"" says Jónsson. ""But the fact that both studies independently concluded that earthquake hazard decreases towards the southern end of the Gulf strengthens the results tremendously."" And a recent analysis of sedimentary cores collected from the bottom of the Gulf also suggests that large quakes have historically been less frequent at its southern end. ""While this is good news, NEOM is not off the hook,"" says Jónsson, ""More investigations into local site conditions, as well as earthquake simulations, are needed to guide the construction of a resilient city.""

Facebook says it’s refocusing company on ‘serving young adults’,https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745622/facebook-young-adults-refocusing-teams,,['Jacob Kastrenakes'],,,"Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says he’s redirected teams within his company to “make serving young adults their north star.” The comment, made on a call with investors this afternoon, speaks to Facebooks’ concerns about declining usage among teens and young adults. “So much of our services have gotten dialed to be the best for the most people who use them, rather than specifically for young adults,” Zuckerberg said. TikTok is “one of the most effective competitors we’ve ever faced” He suggested the change will be more than just lip service. Facebook usage among older users will grow slower than it otherwise would have because of the changes, Zuckerberg said. Even with those tradeoffs, he said, “I think it’s the right approach.” Zuckerberg expects the changes to take years. One of the more immediate shifts could be to Instagram, which he says will see “significant changes” to lean further into video and make Reels “a more central part of the experience.” The shift toward video is very clearly a response to TikTok, which Zuckerberg called “one of the most effective competitors we’ve ever faced.” While the details are largely talk for now, it’s clear that Facebook has been thinking and planning this before now. The Verge reported today on leaked Facebook documents showing the company’s alarm at seeing declining usage, with a precipitous drop predicted in the years ahead. The documents also show ideas Facebook considered to increase usage among younger users, including revamped groups, job finding tools, and “mood feeds.”",2021-10-25 21:58:49,,,theverge

WhatsApp support being revoked is effective from November 1. WhatsApp order will apply to both both Android and iOS smartphones. Here are all the details and how to try and fix the problem.",,2021-10-26 04:15:15,"WhatsApp has been steadily getting a slew of updates to make the chatting experience better than ever. Most of these features are reliant on the latest Android and iOS software, and in order to have the same experience for everyone, WhatsApp keep dropping support for older OS as time passes. And as part of this practice, WhatsApp has again dropped support for a few older smartphones. As part of the next move, WhatsApp will now not be supported on Android devices still running on Android 4.0.3. On the iOS side of things, iPhones running on iOS 9 too will not get support. The support will be dropped starting November 1 but users won’t be immediately unable to use the service; it will keep working until the next major WhatsApp update drops. WhatsApp support dropped on these phones Now, Android 4.0.3 was available on a lot of Android devices back in its heydays. Hence, there are a lot of smartphones that will be affected by this move. Some of the popular ones from Samsung include the Galaxy S2, Galaxy S3 Mini, Galaxy Trend 2, Galaxy Trend Lite, Galaxy XCover 2, Galaxy Core, and Galaxy Ace 2. Similarly, a lot of smartphones from the 2011-2013 era will lose support of WhatsApp in the next few weeks. However, the chances of most of you using any of these smartphones is slim, especially in 2021. Hence, you needn’t worry too much about the drop in support. However, if you decided against updating your iPhone 6S since you first started using it in 2015 for some reason, now might be right time to get that iOS 15 update. WhatsApp will drop support for iOS 9 devices but the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus are compatible with the latest iOS 15 update. Notably, what people with older Android phones can do to keep running their WhatsApp account is to also try and update their phones' software. However, chances of a fix are slim. Meanwhile, WhatsApp has just released the ability to join video and audio calls in a group even after it has started. If you update to the latest version of WhatsApp, you can now see the group chat notification in your WhatsApp group and you can join in at your convenience.

NFTs are a type of digital asset which use blockchain to record the ownership of items such as images, videos and other collectibles. Their roaring popularity has baffled many but the explosive growth shows no sign of abating. Bollywood superstars such as Amitabh Bachchan and Salman Khan are planning to launch NFTs soon. While Bachchan's NFTs will include autographed posters of his movies, Khan has been building excitement on his Twitter account by telling his 43 million followers about the planned NFT launch. Also read : Looking for a smartphone? Check Mobile Finder here . ""NFTs are right now alien to Bollywood but I am sure they (film stars) will see this as another platform where they can use their existing content and generate revenue,"" said Ayaan Agnihotri of Bollycoin, an NFT marketplace for Bollywood assets. Agnihotri said that within days of launch this month, his platform sold 8 million of the 20 million available so-called ""BollyCoins"", crypto tokens that can be used to buy NFTs when they are launched. One BollyCoin is worth 10 U.S. cents. But its still early days for celebrity NFTs in India. Indian cricketer Dinesh Karthik is auctioning a digital art reel from a cricket match where he hit a match-winning six on the last ball for around 5 ethereums, a digital currency, worth around $20,000. But he has yet to receive any bids. ""NFT has picked up a lot in the West in the last one year with now iconic moments from basketball being bought by fans digitally, which gave us the idea,"" Karthik told Reuters. Others have had success. One of India's top fashion designers, Manish Malhotra, recently sold NFTs of digital sketches of some of his most famous creations for $4,000 a piece. Malhotra's website shows one can purchase some of his bridal wear outfits at a lower price range of $2,500-$3,500. The rise of NFTs has baffled many who say it makes little sense to spend large sums of money on items that don't physically exist and can simply be viewed online. Still, global sales volumes of NFTs have galloped to $10.7 billion in the third quarter of 2021, making an eightfold increase from the previous quarter, data from market tracker DappRadar showed. Vishakha Singh, vice president for NFTs at Indian crypto exchange WazirX, said celebrity participation in the segment is set to create excitement in the space.

In prepared remarks during Facebook’s Q3 earnings call today, Zuckerberg blamed the recent avalanche of bad press for the social network on “a coordinated effort to selectively use leaked documents to paint a false picture of our company.” Facebook’s CEO doubled down, running through a checklist of things the company has done around safety and security, projects that will come with a $5 billion price tag in 2021. “It makes a good soundbite to say that we don't solve these impossible tradeoffs because we're just focused on making money, but the reality is these questions are not primarily about our business, but about balancing difficult social values,” he said. Zuckerberg briefly touched on introspection; “I worry about the incentives that we're creating for other companies to be as introspective as we have been,” he said. But his remarks—forceful and angry at times—didn’t really look inward or take responsibility for anything. Instead, the media, lawmakers, and society as a whole are to blame, he argued. Polarization has been around in the US since “before I was born” in 1984, according to Zuckerberg. “If social media is not the main driver of these issues, then it probably can't fix them by itself either,” he said. “I've repeatedly called for regulation to provide clarity because I don't think companies should be making so many of these decisions ourselves,” Zuckerberg said. But that’s a convenient fallback—glacial is Congress’ favorite speed, and an army of lobbyists will be at the ready should lawmakers make a move. Whistleblower Frances Haugen, a former product manager at Facebook, is among those trying to get politicians to act. She testified before lawmakers in London today, shortly after several high-profile news outlets posted stories about documents from the social network, which they dubbed the Facebook Papers. Zuckerberg said today that Facebook “can't change the underlying media dynamics,” and said his focus is on people, not the press. “The reason we've been able to succeed for almost two decades is because we keep evolving and building. Facebook started in a dorm room and grew into a global website. We invented the News Feed and a new kind of ads platform. We became a mobile-first experience. And then we grew a whole family of apps that serve billions of people."" And yet, the company has struggled to stop Groups that spread dangerous misinformation, in part because of a recommendation system that quickly veers off into questionable territory, Facebook’s own employees found. It’s all too easy for online chatter to spill over into real-world violence, in the US and abroad .",https://sm.pcmag.com/pcmag_in/news/z/zuckerberg/zuckerberg-slams-coordinated-effort-to-badmouth-facebook_356t.jpg,pcmag

Facebook whistleblower Haugen to testify as U.K. scrutinizes social media,https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/facebook-whistleblower-haugen-to-testify-as-u-k-scrutinizes-social-media-1.5636713,,['The Associated Press'],,Former Facebook data scientist turned whistleblower Frances Haugen plans to answer questions Monday from lawmakers in the United Kingdom who are working on legislation to rein in the power of social media companies.,,2021-10-25 08:55:36,"LONDON -- Former Facebook data scientist turned whistleblower Frances Haugen plans to answer questions Monday from lawmakers in the United Kingdom who are working on legislation to rein in the power of social media companies. Haugen is set to appear before a parliamentary committee scrutinizing the British government's draft legislation to crack down on harmful online content, and her comments could help lawmakers beef up the new rules. She's testifying the same day Facebook is expected to release its latest earnings. It will be her second appearance before lawmakers after she testified in the U.S. Senate earlier this month about the danger she says the company poses, from harming children to inciting political violence and fueling misinformation. Haugen cited internal research documents she secretly copied before leaving her job in Facebook's civic integrity unit. She told U.S. lawmakers that she thinks a federal regulator is needed to oversee digital giants like Facebook, something that officials in Britain and the European Union are already working on. The U.K. government's online safety bill calls for setting up a regulator that would hold companies to account when it comes to removing harmful or illegal content from their platforms, such as terrorist material or child sex abuse images. ""This is quite a big moment,"" Damian Collins, the lawmaker who chairs the committee, said ahead of the hearing. ""This is a moment, sort of like Cambridge Analytica, but possibly bigger in that I think it provides a real window into the soul of these companies."" Collins was referring to the 2018 debacle involving data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica, which gathered details on as many as 87 million Facebook users without their permission. Haugen also is scheduled to meet next month with European Union officials in Brussels, where the bloc's executive commission is updating its digital rulebook to better protect internet users by holding online companies more responsible for illegal or dangerous content. Under the U.K. rules, expected to take effect next year, Silicon Valley giants face an ultimate penalty of up to 10% of their global revenue for any violations. The EU is proposing a similar penalty. The U.K. committee will be hoping to hear more from Haugen about the data that tech companies have gathered. Collins said the internal files that Haugen has turned over to U.S. authorities are important because it shows the kind of information that Facebook holds -- and what regulators should be asking when they investigate these companies. The committee has already heard from another Facebook whistleblower, Sophie Zhang, who raised the alarm after finding evidence of online political manipulation in countries such as Honduras and Azerbaijan before she was fired.

The Google SoC scored 6,666 points at...",,2021-10-25 12:28:10,"Google Pixel 6 and Google Pixel 6 Pro launched last week and a fresh report suggests that the Google-designed Tensor SoC that powers both smartphones beats the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888, Samsung Exynos 2100, and HiSilicon Kirin 9000 chipsets in GPU benchmarks. These benchmarks - conducted on 3DMark Wild Life, Wild Life Extreme, and Wild Life Stress -were posted by a user on Reddit. Google Pixel 6's Tensor chipset appears to beat the other flagship Android chipsets by a decent score in each of the three tests. It is to be noted that these results do not indicate real world performance. As per Reddit user Greg (u/grt3), he received the Google Pixel 6 early and asked users on the social media platform if they wished to know anything. After a user asked about the GPU performance of the Google Tensor SoC, Greg tested the smartphone on 3DMark Wild Life, Wild Life Extreme, and Wild Life Stress tests. Google's Tensor SoC is said to have scored 6,666 points delivering 39 frames per second in the Wild Life test and 2,028 points at 12.8 frames per second in the Wild Life Extreme test. While in the Wild Life Stress test that lasts for up to 20 minutes it had a best loop score of 2,129 and a low loop score of 1,193 at 56 percent stability. Tipster Golden Reviewer (@Golden_Reviewer) shared an image of the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra and the Huawei Mate 40 Pro , showing the Wild Life Extreme scores. The Galaxy smartphone with its Snapdragon 888 chipset had an overall score of 1,494 points at 8.90 frames per second. On the other hand, the Exynos 2100 chipset version scored 1,793 points at 10.70 frames per second. The Huawei smartphone with the Kirin 9000 SoC scored 2,004 points with 12 frames per second. These results indicate that Google Tensor SoC may be the best Android smartphone SoC in the market in terms of graphical performance, but this information should be taken with a pinch of salt as not many reviewers have benchmarked the newly launched Pixel 6 series or the Tensor SoC. .embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }",https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/google_pixel_6_series_fi_small_1634709558381.jpg,ndtv

But you may be wondering, should I upgrade to macOS Monterey on my Mac now? Read on to figure out what the best option is for you. macOS Monterey was seen as quite stable overall during the beta testing period from June until October. The biggest controversy came from the various iterations of Safari that we saw Apple experiment with before returning to a more subdued and traditional default experience and design. Other than that, a couple of the other disappointments have been Universal Control being pushed back , some Monterey features being limited to Apple Silicon Macs, and RAM management issues that have hopefully been ironed out in the beta process. Here’s the full list of Macs compatible with macOS Monterey macOS Monterey: Here are the features exclusive to M1 Macs Should I upgrade to macOS Monterey? TL;DR : if you have any concerns about app stability, performance issues, and other bugs, hold out at least for the next bug fix update (or maybe even a later update depending on your stability tolerance) For reference, macOS 12.0.1 is the initial launch release If you have critical apps that must work, make sure to check for Monterey compatibility before upgrading and of course remember to make a fresh backup If you’re cool with the possiblity of initial bugs and issues (likely minor), go for it! But if you still have concerns, install Monterey on a secondary Mac if you have one – or hold off for now Finally, you could opt to install the new OS on a separate APFS volume or create a bootable macOS Monterey USB drive (steps for Big Sur should work for Monterey too): How to install macOS Big Sur on a separate APFS volume [Video] How to create a bootable macOS Big Sur USB install drive [Video] And whether you’re upgrading today or are holding off for now over bug and compatibility concerns, here’s our comprehensive look at everything new with macOS Monterey: FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

The report coincides with concerns that some EU lawmakers who are reviewing the Digital Markets Act here (DMA) proposed by EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager may be lenient towards cloud computing companies. Amazon’s Amazon Web Services was the leading provider in the second quarter of this year, followed by Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, market research company Statista found. Others include IBM Cloud, Alibaba Cloud, Salesforce and Oracle . https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png The study was prepared by Frederic Jenny, chairman of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Competition Committee, in his personal capacity for trade body CISPE (Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe). “The DMA does say that cloud infrastructure can come within the ambit of the DMA but it is not obvious that all the suppliers are covered, for example it doesn’t seem that Google Cloud qualifies under the DMA as a gatekeeper or IBM Cloud or Salesforce,” Jenny told Reuters in an interview. He said potential anti-competitive practices by some companies could include unfair pricing techniques or making it technically difficult for users to move to a rival. Jenny said the study interviewed some 25 companies that use cloud computing services, a number of which cited issues such as unfair licence terms that force customers to pay again to use software they already own when they move to a competitor. Respondents were also concerned about providers bundling software products with their cloud infrastructure to make rival products either less attractive or more expensive. Google, Oracle and SAP declined to comment. Microsoft and Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment. EU lawmakers have to thrash out the draft DMA with EU countries before it becomes law, possibly in 2023.",,indianexpress

Breakthrough Listen Releases Analysis of Previously Detected Signal From Nearby Proxima Centauri,http://astrobiology.com/2021/10/breakthrough-listen-releases-analysis-of-previously-detected-signal-from-nearby-proxima-centauri.html,,['Keith Cowing'],,,An intriguing candidate signal picked up last year by the Breakthrough Listen project has been subjected to intensive analysis that suggests it is unlikely to originate from the Proxima Centauri system.,2021-10-25 15:13:47,"An intriguing candidate signal picked up last year by the Breakthrough Listen project has been subjected to intensive analysis that suggests it is unlikely to originate from the Proxima Centauri system. Instead, it appears to be an artifact of Earth-based interference from human technologies, the Breakthrough Initiatives announced today. Two research papers, published in Nature Astronomy, discuss both the detection of the candidate signal and an advanced data analysis process that can finely discern ""false positives."" ""The significance of this result is that the search for civilizations beyond our planet is now a mature, rigorous field of experimental science,"" said Yuri Milner, founder of Breakthrough Inititatives. Breakthrough Listen (a program of the Breakthrough Initiatives) is an astronomical science program searching for technosignatures - signs of technology that may have been developed by extraterrestrial intelligence. Listen's science team, led by Dr. Andrew Siemion at the University of California, Berkeley, uses some of the largest radio telescopes in the world, equipped with the most capable digital processing systems, to capture data across broad swaths of the radio spectrum in the direction of a wide range of celestial targets. The search is challenging because Earth is awash with radio signals from human technology - cell phones, radar, satellites, TV transmitters, and so on. Searching for a faint signal from a distant star is akin to picking out a needle in a vast digital haystack - and one that is changing constantly over time. BLC1 - Breakthrough Listen's First ""Signal of Interest"" - Data and other related material The CSIRO Parkes Telescope in New South Wales, Australia (one of the largest telescopes in the Southern Hemisphere, known as 'Murriyang' in Wiradjuri) is among the facilities participating in Breakthrough Listen's search. One of the targets being monitored by Parkes is Proxima Centauri, the Sun's nearest neighboring star, at a distance of just over 4 light years. The star is a red dwarf orbited by two known exoplanets. The Listen team scanned the target across a frequency range of 700 MHz to 4 GHz, with a resolution of 3.81 Hz - in other words, performing the equivalent of tuning to over 800 million radio channels at a time, with exquisite detection sensitivity. Shane Smith, an undergraduate researcher working with Listen Project Scientist Dr. Danny Price in the summer 2020 Breakthrough Listen internship program, ran the data from these observations through Breakthrough Listen's search pipeline. He detected over 4 million ""hits"" - frequency ranges that had signs of radio emission. This is actually quite typical for Listen's observations; the vast majority of these hits make up the haystack of emissions from human technology. As with all of Listen's observations, the pipeline filters out signals which look like they are unlikely to be coming from a transmitter at a large distance from Earth, according to two main criteria: · Firstly, is the signal steadily changing in frequency with time? A transmitter on a distant planet would be expected to be in motion with respect to the telescope, leading to a Doppler drift akin to the change in pitch of an ambulance siren as it moves relative to an observer. Rejecting hits with no such signs of motion reduces the number of hits from 4 million to around 1 million for this particular dataset. · Secondly, for the hits that remain, do they appear to be coming from the direction of the target? To determine this, the telescope points in the direction of Proxima Centauri, and then points away, repeating this ""ON - OFF"" pattern several times. Local interfering sources are expected to affect both ON and OFF observations, whereas a candidate technosignature should appear only in the ON observations. Even after both of these data filters are applied, a handful of candidates remain that must be inspected visually. Sometimes a faint signal is actually visible in the OFF observations but is not quite strong enough to be picked up by automated algorithms. Sometimes similar signals appear in neighboring observations, indicative of interfering sources that may be turning on and off at just the wrong period, or the team can track down the signals to satellites that commonly broadcast in certain frequency bands. Occasionally an intriguing signal remains and must be subjected to further checks. Such a signal-of-interest was discovered by Smith in Listen's observations of Proxima Centauri using the Parkes telescope. A narrow-band, Doppler-drifting signal, persisting over five hours of observations, that appears to be present only in ""ON'' observations of the target star and not in the interspersed ""OFF"" observations, had some of the characteristics expected from a technosignature candidate. Dr. Sofia Sheikh, currently a postdoctoral researcher with the Listen team at UC Berkeley, dug into a larger dataset of observations taken at other times. She found around 60 signals that share many characteristics of the candidate, but are also seen in their respective OFF observations. ""We can therefore confidently say that these other signals are local to the telescope and human-generated,"" says Sheikh. ""The signals are spaced at regular frequency intervals in the data, and these intervals appear to correspond to multiples of frequencies used by oscillators that are commonly used in various electronic devices. Taken together, this evidence suggests that the signal is interference from human technology, although we were unable to identify its specific source. The original signal found by Shane Smith is not obviously detected when the telescope is pointed away from Proxima Centauri - but given a haystack of millions of signals, the most likely explanation is still that it is a transmission from human technology that happens to be 'weird' in just the right way to fool our filters."" Executive Director of the Breakthrough Initiatives Dr. S. Pete Worden remarked, ""While we were unable to conclude a genuine technosignature, we are increasingly confident that we have the necessary tools to detect and validate such signatures if they exist."" Breakthrough Listen is making all of the data from the Parkes scans available to the public to examine for themselves. The team has also just published two papers (led by Smith and Sheikh) outlining the details of the data acquisition and analysis, and a research note describing follow-up observations of Proxima Centauri conducted with the Parkes Telescope in April 2021. Listen will continue monitoring of Proxima Centauri, which remains a compelling target for technosignature searches, using a suite of telescopes around the world. And the team continues to refine algorithms to improve their ability to discriminate between ""needles"" and ""hay"", including as part of a recently-completed crowdsourced data processing competition in collaboration with kaggle.com. ""In the case of this particular candidate,"" remarks Siemion, ""our analysis suggests that it's highly unlikely that it is really from a transmitter out at Proxima Centauri. However, this is undoubtedly one of the most intriguing signals we've seen to date.""

In July 2015, together with Stephen Hawking, Yuri Milner announced the launch of the $100 million astronomical program Breakthrough Listen, to reinvigorate the search for extraterrestrial intelligence in the universe. In April 2016, they launched Breakthrough Starshot, a $100 million research and engineering program seeking to develop a new technology for uncrewed interstellar travel. Breakthrough Watch, launched in January 2016, is an astronomical program to develop Earth- and space-based technologies that can find evidence of primitive life on Earth-like planets in our cosmic neighborhood.

AirPods 3 Features First Water-Resistant AirPods Charging Case,https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/25/airpods-3-features-water-resistant-airpods-case/,['AirPods'],['Hartley Charlton'],,"The MagSafe Charging Case for the third-generation AirPods features sweat and water resistance, making the standard AirPods the first to feature an IPX4-rated charging case. Apple promoted the sweat and water-resistance of the third-generation AirPods with the device's announcement last week, but the IPX4 rating applies to both the earbuds and the charging case. The AirPods Pro were the first AirPods to offer sweat and water resistance, but the feature only applies to the earbuds themselves, with the charging case featuring no accredited sweat or water resistance rating. The IPX4 rating means that AirPods have ingress protection to withstand dripping, spraying, or splashes of water. It also means that AirPods cannot withstand water jets (IPX5) or water immersion (IPX7). The ""X"" part of the rating explains that the AirPods have no form of ingress protection against solids or dust. The ‌AirPods Pro‌ also now ship with an updated Charging Case that adds ‌MagSafe‌, but unlike the third-generation AirPods, the new case is not officially rated for any kind of ingress protection. The third-generation AirPods feature improved sound quality, a new design with shorter stems, force sensor controls, spatial audio with dynamic head tracking, Adaptive EQ, Find My support, and more. These features debuted with the ‌AirPods Pro‌, but Apple has now brought the standard AirPods up to spec with its ""Pro"" sibling, with the exception of silicone in-ear tips and Active Noise Cancellation (ANC). Sweat and water resistance is now an area where the AirPods surpass the AirPods Pro, but the IPX4-rated charging case is not the only new feature exclusive to the third-generation AirPods; the earbuds also feature an all-new skin-detect sensor. Instead of skin-detect sensors in each earbud, the ‌‌AirPods Pro‌‌ use dual optical sensors to detect if they are in a user's ear. While they effectively perform the same function, the optical sensors can simply tell when they are covered up, rather than specifically against skin. This means that if you put an ‌‌AirPods Pro‌‌ earbud in a pocket or on a surface, it could accidentally resume playback. There have been no rumors to suggest that the next-generation AirPods Pro will feature the new skin-detect sensor and a sweat and water-resistant ‌MagSafe‌ Charging Case, but it seems highly likely that Apple will bring its mid-range AirPods to parity with the entry-level model. The third-generation AirPods have also begun shipping to customers around the world ahead of the device's official launch tomorrow.

And while we think that's a good thing, it can be understandably hard to keep up with. Potentially exciting gems are sure to be lost in the deluge of new things to play unless you sort through every single game that is released on Steam. So that’s exactly what we’ve done. If nothing catches your fancy this week, we've gathered the best PC games you can play right now and a running list of the 2021 games that are launching this year. Steam‌ ‌page ‌ ‌ Release:‌ October 22 Developer:‌ 软星科技（北京）有限公司 | Softstar Entertainment Launch price:‌ $30 ‌|‌ ‌£23.79 |‌ ‌‌AU$42.95 Sword and Fairy is a popular action RPG series in its native Taiwan, though it was mostly unknown until its predecessor released in the west in 2019. That predecessor is a charming if noticeably ropey turn-based affair; this latest instalment heralds the arrival of a whole new real-time combat system that in videos at least, looks pretty serviceable—it was decent in Xuan Yuan Sword 7 , also developed by Software Entertainment. It's the promise of a traditional Chinese setting that is attractive here, so it's well worth investigation if you're looking for something outside the norm. Steam‌ ‌page ‌ ‌ Release:‌ ‌October 20 Developer:‌ Uplay Online Launch price:‌ ‌$30 ‌|‌ ‌£25 ‌|‌ ‌AU$49.95 A dystopian tycoon sim set in a world where young people perform repetitive tasks in front of a livestreamed audience, success is dominated by engagement metrics, and a hyper-critical audience is baying for your blood. In other words: it's a game about becoming a successful YouTuber. You'll ""collaborate with legendary celebrities, explore the city of fame, find out hidden stories, and follow trends to create viral content."" Or you could start a new Skyrim run as a pacifist Argonian—it's up to you. Steam‌ ‌page ‌ ‌ Release:‌ October 21 Developer:‌ HeroCraft PC Launch price:‌ ‌$17 |‌ ‌£13.59 ‌|‌ ‌AU$20.35 Launched into Early Access last week, Gravewood High is a horror game with a whiff of Hello Neighbor about it. It's set in a high school, levels are randomised, environments are destructible, and there's a weird crazed-professor nemesis ready to bludgeon you to death if you're not careful.

This one actually looks a bit like Alone in the Dark, though it's ""inspired"" by the 1920s so there's a bit of a period piece vibe beneath all that 1990s murk.

'Facebook Papers' hit as platform reports billions in profit,https://www.bangkokpost.com/tech/2204203/facebook-papers-hit-as-platform-reports-billions-in-profit,,,,"SAN FRANCISCO: Facebook announced over $9 billion in quarterly profits on Monday, hours after a US news collective published a deluge of withering reports arguing the company prioritizes its growth over people's safety.",,2021-10-25 21:45:00,"SAN FRANCISCO: Facebook announced over $9 billion in quarterly profits on Monday, hours after a US news collective published a deluge of withering reports arguing the company prioritizes its growth over people's safety. The social media giant has been battling a fresh crisis since former employee Frances Haugen leaked reams of internal studies showing executives knew of their sites' potential for harm, prompting a renewed US push for regulation. Facebook released results showing its profit in the recently-ended quarter grew to over $9 billion -- a 17% increase -- and its ranks of users increased to 2.91 billion. Hours earlier, new reports blamed CEO Mark Zuckerberg for his platform bending to state censors in Vietnam, noted Facebook allowed hate speech to flourish internationally due to linguistic shortcomings and said it knew its algorithm fueled toxic polarization online. ""These damning documents underscore that Facebook leadership chronically ignored serious internal alarms, choosing to put profits over people,"" US Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Big Tech critic, said in a statement. News organizations like , and Wired were among those that have now received access to the set of internal Facebook documents that Haugen originally leaked to US authorities and which were the basis of a damning series. Facebook has assailed the reporting as the selective publication of some of its mountain of internal studies, aimed at casting the social network used by billions of people in a dark and inaccurate light. Haugen, who testified on social media before UK lawmakers Monday, has repeatedly said the company puts its continuous growth and thus profits before the well-being and safety of users. ""Facebook has been unwilling to accept even little slivers of profit being sacrificed for safety, and that's not acceptable,"" she told the lawmakers, adding that angry or hate-fuelled content ""is the easiest way to grow"" the social media platform. Facebook has been hit by major crises previously, but the current view behind the curtain of the insular company has fueled a frenzy of scathing reports and a renewed push from US lawmakers to crack down on social media. story out on Monday said Zuckerberg had personally signed off on a push from Vietnam's authoritarian government to limit the spread of so-called ""anti-state"" posts. A report from Politico called the documents a ""treasure trove for Washington's anti-trust fight"" against the platform, revealing internal employee chats about Facebook global dominance. One of Monday's reports, from website , plunged into the company's own worries for its future. ""Teenage users of the Facebook app in the US had declined by 13% since 2019 and were projected to drop 45 percent over the next two years, driving an overall decline in daily users in the company's most lucrative ad market,"" the story said, citing internal company research. The company has bounced back from other scandals like the one involving Cambridge Analytica, a British consulting firm that used the personal data of millions of Facebook users to target political ads. In that case, Zuckerberg went to Washington to apologize and the company agreed to a $5 billion settlement with US regulators.",,bangkokpost
Solskjær steadfast over Manchester United future despite hitting ‘rock bottom’,https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/soccer/english-soccer/solskj%C3%A6r-steadfast-over-manchester-united-future-despite-hitting-rock-bottom-1.4709620?localLinksEnabled=false,,,,"Under-fire Ole Gunnar Solskjær is convinced he remains the right man for the job despite hitting “rock bottom” with Manchester United’s record-breaking home defeat to Liverpool. Brought in as interim replacement for Jose Mourinho in December 2018 and handed the permanent position four months later, progress under the 1999 treble hero has come with plenty of ups and downs. United are now at their lowest ebb under Solskjær, having seen a meek, error-riddled display ruthlessly punished in a 5-0 defeat to arch rivals Liverpool in front of a shell-shocked Old Trafford crowd on Sunday. It was Liverpool’s biggest ever victory on enemy territory, with early Naby Keïta and Diogo Jota goals complemented by a Mohamed Salah hat-trick on an afternoon when Paul Pogba was sent off. Solskjær, who signed a new three-year deal in July, called it the “darkest day” of his time as United boss but remains certain that he is the right man for the job. “Well, the only way I know how to approach life is to wake up tomorrow morning, look forward, of course evaluate what’s gone on, and do my very, very best and be determined to come through difficult times,” he said. “This is the worst feeling, you feel rock bottom and the feeling we’ve had, that we are getting to where we want to be, has been there. “But then in the last few weeks we’ve hit a brick wall and the results haven’t come, the performances haven’t come, we’ve conceded too many goals, too many easy goals and that’s a concern.” The United hierarchy have consistently backed their manager but this humiliation is the biggest test of that support.

Of course the results lately haven’t been good enough, I have to say, and it’s hands up and that brings doubt in anyone’s mind probably. “But I’ve got to keep strong and I do believe in what we’ve been doing – the staff, the coaching staff, the players. “Today’s rock bottom, low in confidence but next week it’s Tottenham away, it’s a Champions League game at Atalanta, the next team who visits us that’s Man City. “We have to look forward, we have to sort the frames of mind out and make sure we go into the next training session and the next game with the right frame of mind.”",,2021-10-24 20:03:42,"Under-fire Ole Gunnar Solskjær is convinced he remains the right man for the job despite hitting “rock bottom” with Manchester United’s record-breaking home defeat to Liverpool.

Chrystia Freeland, Deputy Prime Minister : “We’re now in a new phase. One that is very different from the darkest days.” Mike Le Couteur : Broad pandemic supports are done, making way for targeted programs. We speak with Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough on the way forward. Story continues below advertisement Tackling the climate emergency… Dr. Maria Neira, World Health Organization (WHO) : “Climate change is affecting the pillars of our health: food, water. ” Mike Le Couteur : World leaders are heading to Glasgow with new climate change commitments while falling short on Paris targets. Former Environment Minister Catherine McKenna on what more Canada needs to do heading into the U.N. Climate Summit. It’s Sunday, October 24 th . I’m Mike Le Couteur, and this is The West Block. Thanks for joining us. I’m Mike Le Couteur. Mercedes Stephenson is away today. Well many of the federal pandemic relief programs that helped millions of Canadians pay their bills have come to an end. Since the pandemic isn’t over, starting today there are new programs in place to help Canadian workers and businesses that continue to be affected by COVID-19. The new benefits target the hardest hit sectors and will be around until May of 2022. Chrystia Freeland, Deputy Prime Minister : “Our support needs to be more narrow, more targeted and less expensive.” Mike Le Couteur : The hardest hit sectors: tourism and hospitality will get the most help. A special recovery program will be in place for businesses, like restaurants and hotels, for the next month with plans to introduce legislation that will extend it until next May. The Tourism and Hospitality Recovery Program will provide wage and rent subsidies to businesses with a sustained 40 per cent revenue decline over the past year. Other businesses not in those sectors can apply for a similar program with a sliding scale. These other businesses would quality if they have sustained revenue loss of at least 50 per cent, with a subsidy starting at 10 per cent. Business groups were happy with the extension of the benefits, but say the devil really is in those details. Story continues below advertisement Dan Kelly, Canadian Federation of Independent Business, Toronto : “The bar is too high and the subsidy too low to make a big difference for many businesses that are hanging on by their fingernails.” Mike Le Couteur : As of March 13 th , 2022, the subsidy rates for the rest of the programs will be cut in half. The Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit and the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit will remain. The new Worker Lockdown Benefit will replace CRB. It’s for workers whose jobs are affected by a public health lockdown and will give employees $300 a week if they aren’t already collecting EI. And joining me right now is the Minister of Employment Carla Qualtrough. Minister, thanks for being here. A lot of these benefits are now much more targeted, but at the same time your government will be leaving behind thousands of Canadians who were depending on the CRB to pay their bills. What do you say to them? Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Employment : Thanks Mike, for having me. You know the reality is the economic and public health circumstances have changed from when we put in the CRB, since September of 2020. So we understand with the job numbers where they are, with the unemployment rate where it is, where job vacancies are, that we really needed to move to a move targeted approach that really focus on the sectors that haven’t recovered and to support workers when they’re in a situation of lockdown. We know that these were always intended to be temporary measures, and I would just say, you know, it’s where we are in the evolution of this pandemic and it’s actually a reflection of how we’ve succeeded economically in recovering. Mike Le Couteur : Now part of it, and another one of the programs, is the Canada Recovery Hiring Program. It’s being extended. Subsidy is also being bolstered a little bit to 50 per cent, but we’re still hearing from businesses who are telling us anyways that they’re having trouble filling—finding workers to fill those jobs. So is that program really achieving what it was set out to achieve? Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Employment : Really important question. We’ve been hearing a lot from businesses about the labour shortages they’ve been experiencing. These labour shortages were there before the pandemic and we’re really trying to put in place active measures like the hiring program, the wage subsidy that incentivize work and aren’t as passive, say, as the CRB was, which was appropriate at the time, but we think we’ve moved on. Mike Le Couteur : And when you say you think you’ve moved on, I mean do you really think that if they’re having trouble finding these workers that it’s really setting out what it needs to do, or do you think more needs to happen there? Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Employment : Well I think it’s a combination of a bunch of things. So absolutely, the hiring program is one tool we have. We have got—we’re investing significantly in training where we’re encouraging businesses to use the wage subsidy. The hiring program is underutilized and I think that’s a matter of us getting the message out that if you want to give people more hours, if you want to hire more people, if you want to increase the salary of the people you have on your staff, that’s all eligible under the hiring program. So I spent a lot of time putting that message out in my own community because I think businesses don’t necessarily understand the breadth of the—the scope of the criteria for this program. Mike Le Couteur : Now one of the issues that employers could be facing also is the mandatory vaccinations for certain workers, for certain jobs. If an employee does make the decision not to get vaccinated but it’s required for their job, do they or don’t they qualify for Employment Insurance? Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Employment : Again, important question. So if an employer has a clear policy with clear consequences and it’s well understood that non-compliance, so this condition of employment could lead to dismissal, if they are dismissed, they typically would not be able to access EI for these reasons because of course, a fundamental principle of the EI program is that claimants have to lose their employment through no fault of their own. And this would be seen typically as a choice. Now of course, every case is a case by case basis, certainly not the minister’s purview at all to arbitrate these things. But as a matter of course, typically they would not be eligible. Mike Le Couteur : So how concerned are you when you hear already that lawyers are warning that you could see a great number of challenges here and, you know, what are you basing the grounds on what you’re saying right now, your assertion that they couldn’t collect EI, if you are having a lot of lawyers saying that there could be these challenges and that it could possibly overrun the system with these challenges. Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Employment : Yeah. I mean certainly, I don’t weigh-in on the legality of this. But we’re confident that the Employment Insurance Act stating that—you know basically it says if a claimant, so an EI claimant is disqualified or disentitled form receiving benefits because they left their job, either they were fired or they dismissed—sorry, I shouldn’t say fired—as a result of their own misconduct, which in this case would be non-compliance within existing policy, there is grounds for not getting EI. But I—you know as with any new policy or circumstance, this is case by case. This will have to go through the courts or through the Social Security Tribunal and not my place to weigh-in on the merits of any one particular case. Mike Le Couteur : So help me try and understand this because we’re dealing with a labour shortage, yet as a government you’re saying that you’re comfortable with excluding all of these people and making sure that they also don’t get EI. So how do we sort of square that circle of we need workers, but as a government you’re comfortable with these people being excluded from certain jobs and not getting EI? Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Employment : Well you know effectively, Mike, we know that vaccines are the most effective tool against COVID-19, and we also don’t want people putting fellow employees or fellow workers at risk. We don’t want workplaces to have to shut down because of an outbreak in a workplace, and we announced the details of our mandatory vaccine policy for employees of the Public Service. We are encouraging other businesses to follow suit, and we just think it’s good public health policy but also economic policy to have safe, healthy workplaces and therefore, we want people to be vaccinated and right now, we’re still in the middle of this pandemic and we need people to be vaccinated. We need workers to be vaccinated, of course if they can be. Mike Le Couteur : Yeah. I want to switch gears for a quick second here. Last week, your government introduced the vaccine passport to be recognized hopefully by a number of other countries. So what countries is your government in consultation with right now to make sure that it’s recognized, especially when you consider that the land border with the U.S. or the softening of restrictions of the border with the U.S. is coming just at the beginning of November. A lot of Canadians are looking to try and travel, so have we started the discussions with the U.S. and what other countries will be recognizing our national passport? Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Employment : Well absolutely. First of all, having a standardized national proof of vaccination based on the Smart Health Canada standard is one way to bolster the credibility, the reliability and the acceptance of our, what we would call PVC, which is proof of vaccination credentials. We’ve been working over the past months with a number of international organizations to ensure that these credentials are recognized. We do the same for passports to make sure that countries recognize this. We expect that all countries that are currently accepting Canadian travellers will accept our PVCs, our proof of vaccination credentials, and, you know, all countries that are currently accepting travellers are accepting all forms of vaccine certification. But that work is ongoing and I think as the world, which really has a vested interest, and people moving around and visiting and getting back to whatever normal looks like, we’re all working together to make sure our citizens can safely travel between countries. Mike Le Couteur : On the vaccine passport specifically, how closely are we working with the U.S. and how soon can you say, or can we say, that they will recognize that vaccine passport? Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Employment : I don’t have a timeline for the last part of your question, but we’ve been working with the U.S. a long—you’re talking to an MP who has Point Roberts right as a neighbour and we’re working very closely with the U.S. on this issue. Mike Le Couteur : Okay. Minister Qualtrough, we’re going to have to leave it there. Thanks so much for joining us today. Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Employment : Thanks Mike, take care. Mike Le Couteur : Up next… Catherine McKenna, Former Liberal Cabinet Minister : “Well, it may be raining out, but I am so excited because I’m launching a new initiative at COP26. Stay tuned, it’s going to be awesome.” Mike Le Couteur : That’s former Liberal Cabinet Minister Catherine McKenna. We’ll ask her about life after politics, which includes the U.N. Climate Summit in Glasgow. [Break] Story continues below advertisement [Announcer] Mike Le Couteur : Former Liberal Cabinet Minister Catherine McKenna surprised many political watchers when she decided not to run again in the last election. And before she was infrastructure minister in the Trudeau government, McKenna was the minister of environment, leading Canada’s fight against climate change. She’s out of politics but still in the fight against climate change and now on a more global scale. McKenna is heading to the U.N. in New York this week before heading to Glasgow for COP26, that’s the U.N. Summit on Climate Change. And Catherine McKenna joins me right now. Thanks so much for joining us, and first question: You’ve left politics, but clearly you haven’t left this fight on climate change. Tell me why you think it can be more effective to fight climate change out of politics than inside the corridors of power? Catherine McKenna, Former Liberal Cabinet Minister : Well look, I think I was pretty clear when I decided to leave that it was to focus on my kids but also on the fight against climate change. And pollution doesn’t know any borders. We have a climate plan here in Canada. We need to always be doing more, but we’ve done things like put a price on pollution, phase out coal, make historic investments in sustainable infrastructure, and we need the world to do that and we need momentum going into COP26 and beyond. So that’s really what my focus is on. I will always be someone who sees climate change as the biggest issue and do whatever I can. Mike Le Couteur : On that, you gave a bit of a hint on Twitter in the last few days, last week, saying that you have a big initiative coming. Now it seems to me this would be a great opportunity for you to break this news on our show right now. So why not do that right now? Catherine McKenna, Former Liberal Cabinet Minister : Well Mike, I’m actually partnering with the United Nations and some other folks so I am not going to do that, but stay tuned and there will be an invitation to Canadians to participate because I think—I mean the initiative is intended to show yes COP is a moment in time, but people have been taking action on climate change before COP26 and when they tear it all down, people will continue to be taking action. So it’s going to be great. I’m really excited about it, but everyone’s just going to have to wait. We’re launching next Friday. Mike Le Couteur : You can’t fault me for trying I guess, eh? So looking ahead to COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, people are already lowering expectations, unfortunately. The reality is that countries are far off their targets right now, Canada included. So new reports are showing that Canada won’t hit its emission reduction targets, what happened when you were minister and since, that has allowed Canada to come up short? Catherine McKenna, Former Liberal Cabinet Minister : Well okay. So first of all, I think it’s really important to be clear that we haven’t missed our targets. The targets are a 2030 target so we’re pretty far away from 2030, and we’ve already shown the pathway to how we will meet what we set as an initial target in 2015, reducing emissions by 30 per cent. And the Paris Agreement requires you to ratchet up ambition, so to be more ambitious. So we announced, Jonathan Wilkinson, the prime minister announced that we would reduce emissions by 40 to 45 per cent, and we’re bringing in new initiatives all the time. And I think there’s some really important work that’s being done, including for the oil and gas sector. They have to be part of it. Emissions have to go down from that sector because they’re a very significant portion of Canada’s emissions. But we’re doing things like phasing out the internal combustion engine by 2035. Imagine, like no cars that will be sold in Canada will have any emissions associated with them. Massive retrofit programs, massive investments in public transit. But we all have to do the work. Look, I think COP 26—it’s going to be hard because we need to see the ambition. You’ve seen everyone call for it, including Greta. And it can’t just be talk, it has to be action. Canada has shown what we’re going to do and we know we need to do more, but every country needs to do that and bring it to the table that is the whole purpose of the Paris Agreement, everyone doing their part. Mike Le Couteur : To your point, you’ve always said that climate change is all about math, and it’s very simple for people to understand that. So how can Canada really be taken seriously in the climate change fight if we continue to extra oil and gas? Catherine McKenna, Former Liberal Cabinet Minister : Well first of all, it’s a transition and transitions aren’t linear and they’re not perfect. And so, you know, you can’t immediately wave a magic wand and say, you know we’re getting rid of oil and gas. People are use—we use oil and gas. Everyone is using oil and gas, but we do need to transition. We need to figure that out. And that’s exactly what we’re doing. Part of in this election, the Liberal platform was to tackle emissions from the oil and gas sector that is critically important. We phased out coal. We need the whole world to be phasing out coal. There are still countries like Australia have a lot of work to do. But we also need to figure out jobs and I’ve always felt this that you—the transition has to work for everyone, which means you’ve got to dig deep and you have to figure out how are people going to have good jobs while we do everything we need to do to tackle climate change. And let me be very clear: we know what we need to do. The goal is staying well below 2 degrees, striving for 1.5 degrees that was negotiated in the Paris Agreement, that’s the science. And so we’re going to have to do our part the same way every country in the world is going to have to transition as fast as possible, away from fossil fuels. So that’s coal, that’s oil and gas. Mike Le Couteur : So doing our part but at the same time, you mentioned Australia. There’s also, you know, the U.S. doesn’t have a price on pollution either. How do we use our influence as a country to try and lean on other countries to make sure that they’re coming to the plate with more ambition if we’re trying to bring more ambition? Catherine McKenna, Former Liberal Cabinet Minister : Well I think that’s a really important point, Mike. And I think, you know, sometimes people say well why is Canada doing this? Why have we committed to phasing out coal when, say, Australia hasn’t? Because you need to have credibility if you’re going to go, you know, tell other countries or encourage other countries or support other countries to doing the hard things we all need to do. And so putting a price on pollution, I’ve been slightly encouraged in the United States they’re having a really tough time getting their infrastructure bill passed, but now they’re thinking well maybe another way to get emission reductions would be a price on pollution. I’ve had many conversations with Americans, including Republicans, who support and market mechanisms to reduce emissions. But this is what I want to do, I mean my focus is how do we scale ambition on climate and how can we share Canada’s lessons? But just get real because you’re right, it is math. So, first of all, we need to get the whole world off coal as fast as possible. We also need to transition off of oil and gas, and that requires a lot of work, a lot of different solutions and ultimately, I’ve been working together. And that’s, you know, you can shame folks, but also you need to show the path because it’s not that easy and I think Canada’s got a great role to play going into this COP. We’re helping to find—we’ll secure $100 billion per year to support developing countries because they’ve done the least to cause climate change and they’re paying the price right now and we need to be supporting them. So, there’s a lot of pieces to this puzzle, but I think Canada’s got a great story and maybe even a better story because it’s hard for us, because we do produce oil and gas and we’ve—you know, coal. And so showing that we’re figuring it out and working really hard, I think is a really important lesson for other countries and a very practical way and as I say, that’s my thing: how do we scale climate solutions all around the world? Mike Le Couteur : I’ve only got a minute for this last question and it’s kind of a two-parter. So about that $100 billion for the developing nations, what happens if we don’t raise that much money? And what to you, does a successful COP26 actually look like? Catherine McKenna, Former Liberal Cabinet Minister : Well we have to raise that money. There will be no success in COP unless there’s $100 raised, so Canada’s got to dig deep. Germany’s digging deep. Next week—well sorry, this coming week I’m at the U.N. looking at how we raise the ambition. Germany is there. They’re the co-lead with Canada on raising the $100. I mean look, success ultimately would look like we’ve got a path to stay well below 2 degrees, striving for 1.5. I don’t think we’re going to get there, but the Paris Agreement, don’t lose hope. It requires countries to continuously raise the ambition and guess what? Every single day around the world, people are taking action on climate change. So COP, they’re going to fold things up and go home. People will go home, but people will still be acting and that’s what we need to do. We need to continue pushing as hard as we can, all of us digging deep. It’s not just about governments, it’s about individuals, it’s about businesses and we can do it. We tackled COVID, we’re on our way to getting out of COVID. It’s the same thing with climate. We can do it, but we’re going to have to really work extremely hard and be focused. Mike Le Couteur : Catherine McKenna, I appreciate you taking the time being with us. Unfortunately we’re going to have to leave it there. We’ll talk to you soon. Thanks again. Up next, who’s in and who’s out? There are some big questions heading into Tuesday’s cabinet shuffle. We’ll be joined by Global News’ Amanda Connolly to talk about how these appointments will outline key government priorities. Stay with us. Story continues below advertisement [Break] Mike Le Couteur : Justin Trudeau unveils his third cabinet as prime minister this week. The swearing in ceremony will take place on Tuesday at Rideau Hall with Canada’s first Indigenous Governor General Mary May Simon. Globalnews.ca political reporter Amanda Connolly is here to break it all down for us. Thanks for joining us, Amanda. Amanda Connolly, Global News Political Reporter : Thanks for having me. Mike Le Couteur : I guess the first question. It’s the elephant in the room. I mean there’s no way that Harjit Sajjan can remain as defence minister, right? Amanda Connolly, Global News Political Reporter : This really is the big thing that we’re watching for right now and again, this is—this has been a big problem for the government, their handling of the military sexual misconduct crisis. I spoke with one expert a couple of weeks ago saying this is effectively a sucking chest wound for the government. They just cannot seem to get it under control to really stem the damage flowing from this. And of course, we’re watching for that as we look to the cabinet shuffle next week. Mike Le Couteur : Yeah. And so without naming other names, I mean how much does the naming of the cabinet really sketch out the priorities that this government will have? Who goes where and especially when you consider child care, environment, those types of things. Amanda Connolly, Global News Political Reporter : I think that’s a really good question and again, as you mentioned there, child care. There are some really big items on the government agenda right now that they have to have people in those jobs who can actually get things done. I think first and foremost, though, you’re really looking at three things that are going to factor in here. You’ve got the geographic representation, people from all the different across the country. You’ve got the gender balance issue, too, second, which is a big thing for the government here. They have doubled down committing to that, so we’re going to watch for whether that increases the size of the cabinet here, too, and again, as you mentioned, actually getting things done. They’re looking for people here, again, with another election possibly 18 months away, that can jump into these files, get things done and not mess it up while doing it. Mike Le Couteur : And it’s interesting because there are some backbenchers, who have been doing well, either as parliamentary secretaries, or otherwise that have been really carrying the mail and in a sense, they’ve got to promote them as well, right? Amanda Connolly, Global News Political Reporter : Yeah. And again, this is, I imagine, a tricky issue for the government. You’ve got people who have been doing the backbench work, parliamentary secretary stuff now for a couple of years in this government and haven’t necessarily seen the promotions that maybe they feel they’re owed or that people might think they are owed. So you’ve got to imagine here, again, a difficult balance for the government looking at who to promote, who they’re going to have to keep relying on to go out there and do a lot of this work in terms of the TV interviews and shoring things up when there are problems for the government. Mike Le Couteur : And there’s one thing that I thought was always interesting. There’s—you know we sort of talk about it behind the scenes and say oh, this person for sure; they’re definitely going to get one. And sometimes they get passed over, either because of regional representation or for other reasons. How do you think that that’s going to affect caucus morale when there are going to be people who will be passed over and then, you know, they have to take up their role as a backbencher? Amanda Connolly, Global News Political Reporter : Well they’re in a really challenging position right now and that’s again, because we had this—we just had this election. They did not get the majority that a lot of people think they were looking for with that decision, right? So they obviously are going to have a limited timeframe here. They’re going to be looking to really make an impact and with that, you need your caucus to work together. You have to have that cohesion, that ability to get things done and to have that—that strong cohesive unity in the caucus itself to present a united front to Canadians. Mike Le Couteur : Because you can really upset some people if they get left off, again. Amanda Connolly, Global News Political Reporter : Absolutely. Mike Le Couteur : It’s just one of those interesting dynamics that thankfully you or I don’t have to do. We can just sit here and talk about it, right? Amanda Connolly, Global News Political Reporter : That’s the best part, right? Mike Le Couteur : Thanks so much for this, Amanda, really appreciate it. Well, that’s our show for today, everyone. Thanks so much for spending your time with us. Mercedes Stephenson will be back next Sunday. For The West Block, I’m Mike Le Couteur.

Convention: Fresh Crisis In S’East PDP Over Nat’l Auditor Position,https://leadership.ng/convention-fresh-crisis-in-seast-pdp-over-natl-auditor-position/,"['NEWS', 'POLITICS']",['Chibuzo Ukaibe'],,The crisis within the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the South East over consensus candidacy assumed a fresh dimension yesterday as the Anambra state chapter has rejected the moves to impose an aspirant on the party for the position of national auditor ahead of the October 30-31 National Convention of the party. Recall that the […],,2021-10-25 08:47:18,"The crisis within the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the South East over consensus candidacy assumed a fresh dimension yesterday as the Anambra state chapter has rejected the moves to impose an aspirant on the party for the position of national auditor ahead of the October 30-31 National Convention of the party. Recall that the party leaders in the zone had been at loggerheads over the emergence of Senator Samuel Anyanwu as consensus candidate for the national secretary position. The positions of national secretary, national auditor, deputy national legal adviser were micro-zoned to the region ahead of the convention. While party leaders from Anambra State were prevailed upon by the PDP Zonal meeting in Enugu earlier in the month to forgo position of the national secretary and settle for the position of the national auditor, party stakeholders from the state, who spoke with LEADERSHIP, said a stranger is being imposed on the party. Three aspirants from Anambra State have been cleared to run for the position of the national auditor, namely, Hon. Mrs. Chibuogwu Benson-Oraelosi; Prince Samben Nwosu, a former state organising and former state publicity secretary and Obinna Okechukwu. However, a source at the Enugu meeting, informed that a name was presented as being nominated by the Anambra chapter as consensus candidate for the position of the national auditor. Embittered by the development, delegates from Anambra, it was gathered, have resolved to come to the field and vote massively for a candidate of their choice who has been active in party politics. Reacting, a prominent woman leader in the zone, Princess Ifeoma Anazodo, called on the Anambra people to project Mrs. Benson-Oraelosi, and get her elected to show that it is a question of “monkey de work, baboon dey chop”. In a document being circulated, a foundation member of the party and former chairman and former organising secretary in the state, Chief Amaechi Onowu, told LEADERSHIP that there has been no consensus of any sort in Anambra State chapter. He described the declaration by Chief Odefa as a complete nullity adding that there is no way a person, who is a “stranger and unknown to PDP members”, put forward by persons from outside Anambra, can represent the state at the NWC. “Upon my embarrassing receipt of the Press Statement by Chief Odefa, I inquired to know how and when the consensus agreement was reached, only to discover that one of the PDP leaders from Anambra State connived with some leaders outside Anambra state to impose the so-called Mr. Obi Okechukwu on our great party members. “The said Mr. Obi Okechukwu has never been an executive or major stakeholder of the party at either the ward, LGA or State level, but just a personal associate of the leader” Onowu declared. Also speaking on the matter, a PDP chieftain in the state, Chief Obinna Okafor, stated that Anambra has resolved to bring a party person for the position. Okafor maintained that Okechukwu’s credential is best suited for external auditor and not for membership of the NWC, especially as he has no knowledge of party affairs. Another party chieftain, Barr Ernest Nwoye, told LEADERSHIP “There is no consensus to my knowledge. Who and who met and agreed on consensus? Who is the consensus candidate that I , a founding member of the Party, do not know of? What has that person done for the Party that may warrant consensus? The position open to my knowledge is open for now. Contestants are even campaigning,” he said.",,leadership
ATO told to make better use of technology,https://www.newcastleherald.com.au/story/7485586/ato-told-to-make-better-use-of-technology/?src=rss,,"['Colin Brinsden', ' AAP Economics and Business Correspondent']",,,,2021-10-26 05:39:12,"A federal parliamentary committee has called on the Australian Taxation Office to make better use of new technologies. A review of the 2018/19 commissioner of taxation annual report makes a number of recommendations, including amendments to legislation that provides taxpayers with protections when dealing with debts. It wants to ensure that a debt is not payable until a final determination is made by a relevant dispute body or court. Chair of the House of Representatives standing committee on tax and revenues, Jason Falinski, said the ATO has recently undertaken considerable reform and restructuring . ""(It) is staffed by experienced and dedicated people who are to be congratulated for having got us through the economic chasm of COVID,"" the Liberal MP said. ""However, some of its functions have been neglected, and moreover, there is considerable expertise in this country - human and technological - waiting to be deployed in many areas of taxation."" The committee calls for the use of blockchain and other leading technologies to optimise the use of the Australian business register and minimise any ongoing costs of maintaining it.

Transition to electric vehicles ‘won’t happen overnight’ but it needs to start now,https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/transition-to-electric-vehicles-won-t-happen-overnight-but-it-needs-to-start-now-20211024-p592nn.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_politics,,['Katina Curtis'],,"Australia needs to start the switch to electric vehicles soon, but policymakers also need to look at the wider implications, such as how to deal with more people driving in the pandemic.",,2021-10-24 10:00:00,"A fear of public transport during the pandemic has driven up congestion on city roads and this may be exacerbated by the take-up of electric vehicles once people realise they’re cheaper to run than petrol cars. But experts say the switch to electric does need to start soon to address Australia’s emission levels. Experts say the transition to electric cars does need to happen but policymakers must consider the wider implications, such as congestion. Credit: iStock As Liberal and Nationals politicians debate how the nation should work towards net zero emissions by 2050, a report from the Grattan Institute recommends putting a cap on the number of emissions new cars sold in Australia are allowed to put out. This could be ratcheted down to zero over time, meaning hybrids and newer technology petrol cars could still be sold as the transition to entirely electric transport takes place. Transport accounts for 17.5 per cent of Australia’s emissions, with more than half of that coming from light vehicles. In January, there were just over 20,000 electric passenger cars registered, a 63 per cent jump from the previous year. In total, there are more than 14.8 million passenger cars registered in Australia and another 3.5 million utes and vans. But electric vehicles are gaining popularity: in the first half of 2021, Australians bought more new electric vehicles than in the whole of 2020. Grattan’s transport and cities program director Marion Terrill said it was important governments helped push the transition to electric for environmental reasons , but they must also consider the wider implications. “It’s a transition that takes time,” she said. “And it doesn’t have to happen overnight. It just has to get started overnight.” The federal government believes consumer demand rather than regulation should drive electric vehicle uptake. It warns putting an emissions ceiling on imports could increase the cost of new vehicles. “We’ll continue to invest in fleets and infrastructure to support those Australians who want to drive an EV. What we won’t do is force Australian motorists out of the car they want to drive through bans, taxation or restricting choice through imports,” Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor said. The government is set to release its future fuel strategy within the next fortnight. Ms Terrill cautioned that although the environmental and health benefits of EVs were evident, “they don’t solve everything” and could make congestion in cities worse. A worldwide trend during the pandemic has been that people are more likely to drive their cars than take public transport out of fear of contagion. Australian Automobile Association managing director Michael Bradley said it could take years for people to regain confidence in public transport. The AAA’s research also highlights people choosing to take road trips instead of flying holidays. “As people decide how they’re going to handle transportation in this new normal, they are turning to cars with a surge in not just electric vehicle but second-hand sales as well,” he said. “All this is a perfect storm for decision-makers and means genuine policy and structural reform is needed.” Ms Terrill said if governments didn’t act to encourage commuters back onto buses, trains and trams, this could be compounded once people realise driving electric is cheaper. While under existing policies it could take more than a decade for an electric car owner to reap the benefits, the Grattan report estimates EV drivers could save $900 over the first five years if an emissions cap was implemented. “All those marginal decisions, like whether to take the train or the bus, or if you’re in a hurry, or it’s going to rain or you’ve got packages to carry, all of those types of things. If it’s a bit cheaper, sometimes you’ll err on the side of driving,” Ms Terrill said. “It’s important not to get carried away with how great EV’s are [although] they’re better than what we have now.” The report says congestion charges are the “most direct and effective way to manage demand for driving” although she acknowledges they are politically controversial. But international experience, such as in Stockholm, has shown that although people hate the idea of the new charges, once they’re in place drivers realise their benefits including fewer cars on the road. “We haven’t led the way but if you don’t lead the way, you do get the advantage of seeing how it went somewhere else,” Ms Terrill said. Mr Bradley said in the first instance, the full amount collected in fuel excise – more than $13 billion a year – should be spent on road networks. But he said over the long-term, there would have to be reform of motoring taxes.

Virginia's governor's race remains close,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/virginia-governor-race-remains-close-terry-mcauliffe-glenn-youngkin/,,,,The race could be a referendum on President Biden's agenda and popularity.,,2021-10-25 23:44:16,"In what could be a referendum on President Biden's agenda and popularity, Virginians are headed to the polls next week to elect a new governor. Mr. Biden won the state by 10 points, but Democrat Terry McAuliffe holds only a slim lead over his Republican challenger, Glenn Youngkin. Independent voters will be key to deciding the race. Independent voter Kendra Lee is a prime example of why this race is so close. ""I cried when Hillary Clinton lost,"" Lee said. ""If someone told me I'd ever be not considering voting for a Democrat I would have thought you were crazy, you were out of your mind."" And yet, the mother of two voted for Republican Glenn Youngkin. After a year of virtual learning and now mask mandates in schools, she said she trusts him more with her kids' education. ""I don't think he would have as much governmental restrictions,"" Lee said on Youngkin's appeal. ""I think that he would leave it more in terms of local control."" Youngkin, a multimillionaire businessman, has wooed voters like Lee by making schools a central focus of the race — holding ""Parents Matter"" rallies where he hammers McAuliffe over something he said at a debate: ""I don't think parents should be telling schools what they should teach."" ""This movement is being led by parents all over the Commonwealth of Virginia, parents who are saying 'no' — I am the one who gets to decide what's best for my children,"" Youngkin said. Youngkin has tapped into concern over race and gender issues in schools and he's opposed to both mask and vaccine mandates. When asked about the mandates, Lee said, ""I just feel like I know what's best for my family better than a politician does."" Independent Robert Clarke also voted for Mr. Biden, but calls this decision a toss-up. When asked what message a Republican winner in Virginia's governor's race would send, Clark said, ""That there is some tepidness around the president's agenda. There are a lot of concerns about the choices he's made."" There's concern among some Democrats that a loss in Virginia would be a preview of what's to come in next year's midterms. McAuliffe is trying to make this a referendum on former President Trump. McAuliffe said Youngkin has a ""far-right"" agenda, citing caught-on-tape comments about abortion: ""When I'm governor...we can start going on offense. But as a campaign topic, sadly, that, in fact, won't win my independent votes that I have to get."" ""We cannot go back,"" McAuliffe said. ""He is against gay marriage. He is against a woman's right to choose."" The choice of swing voters like Clarke will likely decide who wins. ""I mean, I would like to imagine that my vote is the deciding one, but it won't be,"" Clarke said. ""I'm just going to go out and vote for what I believe in.""

Biden to meet with Schumer and Manchin in Delaware,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/joe-biden-meets-joe-manchin-chuck-shcumer-delaware/,,,,Democrats are working to reach consensus on a framework for Mr. Biden's domestic policy agenda.,,2021-10-24 12:56:28,"Washington — President Biden will meet with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senator Joe Manchin in Delaware on Sunday as Democrats look to broker an agreement on the president's social spending plan , a person familiar with the gathering confirmed to CBS News. Democrats are working to reach consensus on a framework for Mr. Biden's domestic policy agenda, which will require support from Manchin and Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, both moderate senators who objected to the package's initial $3.5 trillion price tag. But there is daylight between Manchin and Democratic leaders over the topline number, as the West Virginia senator has said he supports a $1.5 trillion plan, while Mr. Biden set a price range for the legislation at roughly $2 trillion. In addition to trimming the social spending package, Democrats are also hashing out the details of how to pay for it , as the White House faced resistance from Sinema over its plan to raise the corporate tax rate and top income rate rate for the wealthiest Americans. Mr. Biden's sweeping domestic policy package was initially set to include his plans for paid family leave, free community college, universal pre-K and to expand Medicare to include dental, vision and hearing. But at a town hall hosted by CNN on Thursday, the president said Manchin is opposed to Medicare expansion and free community college. Mr. Biden also said his plan for 12 weeks of paid family leave had been cut down to four weeks. U.S. President Joe Biden speaks at the Electric City Trolley Museum in Scranton, Pennsylvania, U.S., on Wednesday, Oct. 20, 2021. Biden, trying to drum up public support for his economic agenda in Scranton, met with the leader of the Congressional Progressive Caucus on Monday as lawmakers returned for make-or-break negotiations over the president's infrastructure and social spending proposals. Photographer: Hannah Beier/Bloomberg via Getty Images Bloomberg The president, however, expressed optimism that Democrats in both chambers could reach an agreement on a framework for the package, one that would garner support from Manchin and Sinema. ""What we're trying to do is reach a point here where I'm able to present to the Senate — they're able to vote on — and the House a serious, serious piece of legislation that changes the dynamic for working-class folks in America and middle-class folks, and begins to have the very wealthy and corporations just begin to pay their fair share,"" he said Thursday.

"CBP agents cited for ""misconduct"" in Facebook posts were largely allowed to keep jobs",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/customs-and-border-protection-agents-facebook-posts-misconduct/,,,,"A report released Monday the House Oversight and Reform Committee found a ""number of failings at CBP, including an inconsistent disciplinary process.""",,2021-10-25 22:10:55,"A Customs and Border Patrol agent posted on Facebook about an infamous 2019 image of a father and son whose bodies washed up on the U.S.-Mexico border. In the post, he called them ""floaters."" He was allowed to retire with disability, a new report released Monday by the House Oversight and Reform Committee found. This was one of 60 cases cited in a sweeping investigation by the Democratic-controlled committee of Customs and Border Protection agents who committed ""serious misconduct"" by sharing explicit and violent messages such as these on secret Facebook pages. Only two were ultimately fired. The investigation revealed ""a number of failings at CBP, including an inconsistent disciplinary process, a failure to train on and enforce social media policies, and senior leadership's failure to take appropriate actions despite knowledge of these Facebook groups,"" according to the report. An agents wears a U.S. Customs and Border Protection badge during a tour of a facility in El Paso, Texas, on Friday, June 28, 2021. Yuri Gripas/Abaca/Bloomberg via Getty Images ""CBP will not tolerate hateful, misogynist, or racist behavior or any conduct that is unbecoming of the honor we hold as public servants,"" a CBP spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News. ""DHS, including CBP, is participating in an internal review as directed by Secretary Mayorkas to identify and terminate intolerable prejudice, and to reform policies and training. CBP is working to review policies and to underscore the need to respect the dignity of every individual, fight against discrimination, safeguard civil rights and civil liberties, and increase transparency and accountability."" Investigators examined 135 cases of alleged misconduct on Facebook linked to CBP employees. In total, two individuals were fired, while 43 were suspended without pay, 12 were granted letters of reprimand, 11 received warnings, and three were suspended without pay or received another form of discipline. Ten personnel retired prior to the investigation's end. ""Most of the 60 agents who committed misconduct received reduced penalties, and 57 of them continue to work with migrants today,"" the report found. ""The vast majority of agents—including those who made degrading and even threatening comments about migrants—received only minor discipline,"" it later added. Some of the other instances included a CBP supervisor who posted an internal CBP video of a migrant falling off a cliff to their death. The supervisor faced removal, but upon agency review, received only a 30-day suspension. ""Do the gators have CBP serial numbers on them for inventory purposes?"" one Border Patrol agent posted during a discussion of stocking the Rio Grande River with alligators and sharks to prevent migrants from entering the United States. The official received a ""letter of reprimand."" Officials still at work also include a Border Patrol agent who posted a ""sexually explicit doctored image and derogatory comments"" about a member of Congress and was subsequently issued a 60-day suspension and awarded back pay, despite a recommendation from the discipline board that he be removed. Though only two were ultimately removed, CBP's Discipline Review Board recommended firing two dozen agents for ""serious misconduct."" One agent who was removed posted ""offensive images of an alt-right and white supremacist symbol and sexualized images of a Member of Congress,"" according to the report. The National Border Patrol Council invoked arbitration on behalf of the agent, and the final outcome remains pending. The second agent removed posted ""multiple offensive and abhorrent posts,"" including a ""doctored picture of a Member of Congress being violently sexually abused and raped by President Trump."" The firing was appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) – an independent, quasi-judiciary agency within the Executive Branch – that later affirmed the decision. The House first launched its investigation in 2019 after reports by ProPublica shined a light on racist and sexist messages exchanged between agents in the private Facebook message boards. Investigators had repeatedly tried to access unredacted disciplinary cases, but said the Trump administration refused to make them available, even after being subpoenaed. ""On February 17, 2021, under the Biden Administration, CBP finally began providing complete and unredacted files regarding employees, their alleged misconduct, and proposed and final disciplinary measures,"" the report read. ""CBP's failure to prevent these violent and offensive statements by its own agents or impose adequate discipline creates a serious risk that this behavior will continue,"" Representative Carolyn Maloney from New York, the committee chairwoman, said in a statement. One notorious Facebook group, known as ""I'm 10-15"" – Border Patrol's code for ""aliens in custody"" – boasted more than 9,500 followers, including former Border Patrol chiefs Rodney Scott and Carla Provost, neither of whom reported the behavior. Officials told the committee their membership granted them an easy way to communicate with and ""unfiltered"" access to rank-and-file officers. In response to the incidents in this report, senior CBP leadership directed the immediate development of annual social media training that incorporates other aspects of existing training into a specific social media training; and mandates that every CBP employee complete the training by September 30th of each year. From August 2016 to November 2017, CBP investigated 13 cases of agents posting racist and sexist content on the ""I'm 10- 15"" Facebook group, according to documents obtained by the discipline board, three years before it was publicly reported. In total, CBP investigated 136 cases of inappropriate social media activity, but found that 62 allegations were unsubstantiated. In a push for greater transparency, CBP plans to launch a new section on its website dedicated to disclosing agency data and policies including its employee arrest statistics, searchable information regarding use of force trends, and public statements regarding in-custody migrant deaths. Last month, the Biden administration demobilized units of Border Patrol agents on horseback in Del Rio, Texas, following controversy over the tactics they employed to disperse Haitian migrants. Homeland Security pledged to ""swiftly"" investigate the incidents and take disciplinary actions if warranted, but has yet to issue its findings.

"Charlottesville ""Unite the Right"" civil trial begins, 4 years after rally",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/charlottesville-trial-unite-the-right-rally/,,,,Twelve Virginia residents will sit on the jury in the civil trial in which white supremacists are accused of orchestrating violence in Charlottesville that left one dead in 2017.,,2021-10-25 20:47:55,"More than four years after white supremacists wreaked havoc in Charlottesville, Virginia, victims of the violence are suing the neo-Nazis and white nationalists who organized the protests, claiming in civil court that the organizers of the ""Unite the Right"" rally planned the violent attacks against counter-protesters, resulting in the death of one protester and the injury of more than a dozen others. The trial kicked off Monday in federal court with jury selection. Ten members of the Charlottesville community, some of whom were injured as a result of the violence, brought the lawsuit against a group of neo-Nazis, white supremacists and hate groups. Ten organizations are being sued and the other 14 defendants are people who orchestrated the weekend events that culminated in violence in August 2017 claim their actions are covered by freedom of speech and that the violence was unplanned and took place when rally goers acted in self-defense, while plaintiffs claim that it was carefully coordinated. ""There is one thing about this case that should be made crystal-clear at the outset — the violence at Charlottesville was no accident,"" the complaint says. ""The violence, suffering, and emotional distress that occurred in Charlottesville was a direct, intended, and foreseeable result of Defendants' unlawful conspiracy."" The rally drew hundreds of white nationalists who were there in part to protest the city's decision to remove a monument to Confederate General Robert E. Lee from a park. One of the defendants, James Alex Fields Jr, has previously pleaded guilty to federal hate crimes charges and admitted that he intentionally plowed his speeding car into a crowd of anti-racism protesters, killing Heather Heyer and injuring dozens. He has been sentenced to life in prison. In total, the death toll that weekend rose to three when a state police helicopter that had been monitoring the event and assisting with the governor's motorcade crashed, killing two troopers. The protests led to a national uproar when President Trump blamed the violence at the rally on "" both sides ,"" a statement critics saw as a refusal to condemn racism. During his campaign, Mr. Biden said the events in Charlottesville became the catalyst for his run for the presidency . The plaintiffs are seeking an unspecified amount in monetary damages, and are hoping to deter future events like that from happening in Charlottesville, or anywhere in America, ever again. Executive director Amy Spitalnick of Integrity First for America, the nonprofit that is supporting the lawsuit, told CBS News in a statement, ""The violence in Charlottesville four years ago was no accident. And at a moment of rising extremism, this case makes clear that violent hate won't go unanswered — that accountability and justice matter."" According to CBS Charlottesville affiliate WCAV , the plaintiffs have terabytes of evidence proving the events of the rally were orchestrated, and detailed messages exchanged on the online platform Discord, a gaming and messaging app that they say was used to organize the rally. In addition to the digital evidence, which details hateful anti-Semitic and racist rhetoric, plaintiffs will argue that the defendants violated a Civil War-era law that was used to stop the Ku Klux Klan from terrorizing and infringing on the civil rights of African Americans. In court on Monday, Judge Norman K. Moon instructed a group of impaneled jurors that they must not search for or interact with any news or information about the case, and warned, ""you are just simply not allowed to talk about the case with anyone."" He indicated that they do not anticipate having a full jury until possibly Wednesday morning, when opening arguments could take place. The trial is expected to last four weeks.

Der findet das unseriös.",,2021-10-24 16:54:41,"Ein brisantes Gerichtsverfahren in Palermo erhält einen Hauch Hollywood, wenigstens in der Besetzung einer Nebenrolle. Filmstar Richard Gere, 72 Jahre alt, bekannt etwa aus ""Pretty Woman"" und ""An Officer and a Gentleman"", ist als Zeuge zugelassen worden im Prozess gegen Matteo Salvini im Fall Open Arms . Italiens früherem Innenminister und Chef der rechtspopulistischen Partei Lega wird vorgeworfen, dass er im August 2019 sein Amt missbraucht habe, als er ein Schiff der katalanischen NGO Proactiva Open Arms mit 147 Flüchtlingen an Bord während 19 Tagen nicht in einem italienischen Hafen anlanden ließ. Die Anklage lautet auf Freiheitsberaubung. Bei einer Verurteilung drohen Salvini bis zu 15 Jahre Haft. Gere hielt sich in jenem politisch bewegten italienischen Sommer, der im Sturz Salvinis enden sollte, ferienhalber mit der Familie in Italien auf. ""In der Nähe von Rom"", erzählte der engagierte Schauspieler einmal. Er hörte von der Blockade der Open Arms vor Lampedusa, kontaktierte die Seenotretter, flog dann runter auf die Insel, kaufte Früchte und Mineralwasser ein für die Passagiere und ging an Bord, um zu helfen. Open Arms schlug Gere nun als Zeugen vor, damit der aus erster Hand von den dramatischen Zuständen berichten könne. Manche Flüchtlinge waren aus Verzweiflung über Bord gesprungen, andere mussten als medizinische Notfälle vom Schiff gebracht werden. Alles, was Sie heute wissen müssen: Lesen Sie im kostenlosen SZ am Morgen & Abend Newsletter die Nachrichten des Tages, zusammengefasst und eingeordnet von der SZ-Redaktion. Der Staatsanwaltschaft Palermos wäre es jetzt aber lieber gewesen, wenn Open Arms auf den Zeugen Gere verzichtet hätte: Dessen Vorladung verwandle das Verfahren nur unnötig in ein ""Spektakel"", hieß es. Doch das Gericht ließ alle Zeugen beider Seiten zu. So werden neben Gere und einigen Flüchtlingen unter anderem auch Italiens ehemaliger Premier Giuseppe Conte, der amtierende Außenminister Luigi Di Maio und Innenministerin Luciana Lamorgese sowie Maltas früherer Premier Joseph Muscat im Prozess aussagen. Salvinis Verteidigung versucht erneut, wie schon in anderen Fällen, die Verantwortung auf die gesamte Regierung zu übertragen: Die Linie der ""geschlossenen Häfen"", mit der sich der Innenminister weltbekannt gemacht hatte, sei von allen Partnern des Kabinetts mitgetragen worden. Er persönlich sei stolz darauf, er habe das Land verteidigt. Italien, sagt Salvini, sei überdies gar nicht zuständig gewesen für die Open Arms : Das spanische Schiff mit seinem spanischen Heimathafen hätte einfach nach Spanien weiterfahren können. Niemand habe die Crew daran gehindert, und darum sei auch der Vorwurf der Freiheitsberaubung gegen ihn falsch. Vor Beginn der ersten Verhandlung postete Salvini auf Twitter ein Foto aus der Gerichtsaula im Gefängnis Pagliarelli in Palermo, samt Gitterstäben: ""Die Linke und die Freunde der illegalen Immigration wollen diesen Prozess: Wie viel das wohl die Italiener kosten wird?"" Und nach der Zulassung des prominenten Zeugen sagte er in die Kameras und Mikrofone der wartenden Reporter: ""Sagt mir: Wie seriös ist ein Prozess, in dem Richard Gere aus Hollywood anreist, um zu sagen, dass ich böse sei?"" Das Spektakel hat bereits begonnen, auch ohne den Filmstar.",,sueddeutsche

Conflicts of interests that were easily discovered online or known by the attorney-general and department but not passed on to the AAT were also heavily criticised. Former chief of staff to Liberal senator George Brandis, James Lambie, was paid $329,000 in 2020/21, reaching only 45 per cent of his benchmarks, which was down from 65 per cent the year before. Former LNP member of the Queensland parliament, Ian Berry, was paid $221,000 in 2020/21 , achieving 43 per cent of benchmarks. Former Liberal party member for the West Australian parliament, Joe Francis, took home $255,000, hitting 65 per cent of his benchmarks. Mr Francis finalised four cases in four months in 2018/19. The average number of cases finalised by members in that year was 15 per month. Former Liberal parliamentarian Russell Matheson was paid more than $250,000 in the last financial year, hitting just over half of his benchmarks. At least two other members were paid tens of thousands of dollars despite not finalising any cases over a four-month period. AAT registrar Sian Leathem defended the performance in Senate estimates on Tuesday, saying the benchmarks did not show the whole picture as some cases were more complex than others. Some members also co-sat on other cases due to their expertise, while other members started only months out from the end of financial years and therefore cases would have been finalised in the next reporting period, Ms Leathem said. Two appointees by former attorney-general Christian Porter, who were then rubber stamped by cabinet, were listed as lobbyists, raising potential conflicts of interest. Members are required to declare any potential conflict of interests. Barton Deakin lobbyist John Griffin, who served as John Howard's senior private secretary and chief of staff to former Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett, ""continues to assist the Liberal and National parties on state and federal election campaigns"" according to the company's website. Mr Griffin declared he was listed on the lobbyist register prior to him starting the role and this was passed on to Mr Porter and the attorney-general's department. The AAT was not made aware of his listing until a media enquiry was made on October 11 this year, almost two years after his appointment. A department official said information would not have been passed onto the tribunal due to privacy issues. The AAT will now require members to provide an annual disclosure of potential conflicts of interest.

He made the call on Sunday shortly after being affirmed as the chairman of the party at the state Congress that was conducted amidst tight security at the outskirts of Jalingo metropolis. The Congress was observed to have taken place despite a court order restraining the party from performing the exercise which was earlier postponed following the pockets of skirmishes that erupted. The Congress, which was conducted via affirmation, was observed to have brought together all the party’s chieftains across the state. Speaking, the leader of the party in the state, Senator Yusuf S. Yusuf, said any other congress outside is illegal. Backing El-Sudi’s call for the aggrieved members of the party to put aside their differences and work for the collective interests of the party, he noted that the aggrieved members did not pass through the party’s normal procedures of resolving disputes before embarking on legal action. Optimistic that the party will form the next administration in the state come 2023, the need for those dragging the party backward to retreat their actions and join hands with the new leadership of the party in order to emerge victorious in the forthcoming polls, he believed can no longer be overemphasized. Also speaking, the Congress committee chairman, Alhaji Tijani Tussa, said before arriving at the affirmative method, all the key critical stakeholders of the party from the state have been engaged in a round table dialogue.

Also on her part, the Secretary of the state Congress, Dr. Rachael Akpabio, who went ahead to make the names of the party Executive of the state public via affirmation, said every part of the state and interests are well represented in the party Executive. Stressing that the “position of the party is very simple”, he urged the aggrieved members “to come back and work for the party.” Reiterating his desire to extend the much needed hands of friendships to the aggrieved members and to as well operate an open-door policy, the newly-elected chairman believed that with all hands on deck, the dreams of the PDP retaining power come next elections, would no doubt turn out to be a mirage. Aggrieved party chieftains who include the immediate past Minister of Power, Engineer Saleh Mamman; former acting governor of the state, Alhaji Sani Danladi Abubakar, to mention but just a few, were observed to have lucidly boycotted the exercise. 2023: Why northeast deserves to produce next president – Gimba We must work to usher in APC administration in Taraba – El-Sudi",2021-10-24 17:12:09,,,dailypost

Meanwhile, the civic body said that they are taking due precautions and measures to curb the spread of the disease.

The catch up cash will go toward new mobile testing, checks and scan sites for a range of problems – with these appointments currently making up the vast majority of the Covid backlog. As well as providing more checks, tests and scans, and help get waiting lists down, £2.3billion of the funding package will be used to try to transform diagnostic services. The Treasury said there will be at least 100 “one-stop-shop” community diagnostic centres across England, including the 44 already announced. These centres are expected to help clear most existing test backlogs caused by the pandemic, including for CT, MRI and ultrasound scans, by the end of the parliament. The Treasury said the additional capacity will also ensure the resilience of the country’s diagnostic services in the years to come. Most read in The Sun CHEW ARE YER?

DeSantis wants to give $5K bonuses to unvaccinated police officers,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/florida-governor-ron-desantis-bonuses-unvaccinated-police-officers/,,,,"""Nobody should lose their job based off these injections,"" DeSantis told Fox News.",,2021-10-25 16:21:32,"Washington — Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said Sunday he hopes to sign legislation that awards $5,000 bonuses to out-of-state law enforcement who refuse to get vaccinated against COVID-19 in violation of local vaccine mandates and move to Florida to work there instead. DeSantis said in an interview with Fox News that the state is ""actively working to recruit"" officers from outside of Florida to fill needs in police and sheriff's departments, and he welcomes law enforcement personnel who risk losing their jobs for defying city and state COVID-19 vaccine requirements. ""In the next legislative session, I'm going to hopefully sign legislation that gives a $5,000 bonus to any out of state law enforcement that relocates in Florida,"" he told Fox News. ""NYPD, Minneapolis, Seattle, if you're not being treated well, we'll treat you better here: you fill important needs for us, and we'll compensate you as a result."" DeSantis, a Republican, said he believes many officers have already become infected with COVID-19, which is driving their decisions not to get vaccinated against the virus. ""Nobody should lose their job based off these injections,"" he said. ""It's a choice you can make, but we want to make sure we're protecting your jobs and your livelihood."" Leaders of several large cities and states have imposed vaccine mandates on public workers, including first responders, leaving them with the choice to either get their shots or be terminated. In Chicago, more than one-third of its nearly 13,000-member police force are defying the city's mandate to report their vaccination status, and in Seattle, six police officers and 11 firefighters faced termination after its vaccine mandate went into effect October 18, while another 93 police and 66 firefighters were seeking exemptions to the requirement. In Massachusetts, its 42,000 state workers were required to be fully vaccinated by October 17, and the state's police union estimated at least 150 state police officers will resign over the mandate. New York City, too, is requiring first responders and municipal workers to be vaccinated against COVID-19 or be placed on unpaid leave, prompting a lawsuit from the New York City Police Benevolent Association. The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund found COVID-19 related deaths accounted for more law enforcement deaths last year than all other causes combined. In a letter to officers, the head of the National Fraternal Order of Police urged officers to ""seriously consider receiving the vaccine to protect themselves and others from becoming seriously ill,"" but noted that the group believes individual officers should be free to decide whether to get vaccinated. ""As an organization that prides itself on protecting the freedoms afforded to us by the U.S Constitution, we are vehemently opposed to any suggestion of a vaccine mandate from any organization, employer or government agency,"" Patrick Yoes, president of the National Fraternal Order of Police, wrote in a letter to officers. DeSantis first rolled out a proposal in September to bolster recruitment of new law enforcement officers to Florida, which includes a $5,000 signing bonus to officers joining the profession, as well as relocation support for officers moving to the state.

The party will also start a huge exercise to strengthen its organisational structure in the run-up to the MCD elections, senior Aam Aadmi Party leader and Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai said. The Delhi BJP hit back, saying that the AAP is free to make claims but the people have seen how the Arvind Kejriwal-led city government failed them during the COVID-19 pandemic and the Centre came to their aid. The BJP has ruled all three municipal corporations of Delhi -- North, South and East -- for three consecutive terms. ""People want a change this time as the BJP-ruled municipal corporations have completely failed in fulfilling their responsibility,"" Rai said during a press conference at AAP headquarters here. There is no respite for the people of Delhi from dirt and garbage under the BJP regime. The MCDs also failed to take preventive steps in time to check the spread of dengue this year, he alleged. ""To fulfil people's wish for a change, the party will start a much bigger campaign after Diwali. Along with this, a huge exercise will also be carried out to strengthen the party's organisational structure,"" he added. Rai claimed that people expressed their dissatisfaction with the performance of the BJP-ruled MCDs during 'Mohalla Sabhas' (Colony Meetings) organised by the AAP under its 'Aapka MLA Aapke Dwar' (Your MLA at your doorstep) programme. As part of the programme, which was launched on September 1 and concluded on October 20, a total of 2,532 'Mohalla Sabhas' were organised across Delhi, he said. ""We heard the grievances of the people and work is on to address them at the government level,"" he said. Rai said that there was not a single 'Mohalla Sabha' where people did not raise the issue of dirt and garbage. He said the AAP is preparing its plan of action for the civic body polls based on the report of 'Mohalla Sabhas'. The party is also reviewing the performance of the organisation in holding 'Mohalla Sabhas', he said. It seems that the BJP's farewell from the MCDs will be before the deadline it has set for the complete removal of the mountain of garbage at Delhi's border, the AAP leader said. Reacting to Rai's comments, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that the AAP leader is free to make political claims but only time will tell as to who will win the MCD elections. ""People of Delhi are fed up with the allegation politics of Aam Aadmi Party leaders,"" he said. People have seen how the Kejriwal government failed them during the COVID-19 pandemic, while the BJP-led central government not only provided medical aid but also ensured free vaccination for 2 crore people of Delhi, he added. ""In the 2022 civic body elections, people will again vote for the BJP and give the party a fourth consecutive term,"" Kapoor said in a statement. On the AAP's plan to strengthen its organisation structure, the BJP leader said that the Arvind Kejriwal-led party doesn't have one to begin with. ""It is just a bunch of manipulators who have won two (assembly) elections by misleading people with freebies. Now the freebies game of the Kejriwal government stands exposed before the people and they also know that MCDs' services get hindered as the Kejriwal government is denying them proper funds,"" Kapoor said.

The tribunal’s answers to questions asked in November 2020 were edited in then-attorney-general Christian Porter’s office before being submitted to the Senate, without AAT registrar Sian Leathem’s knowledge, according to documents Senator Carr obtained under Freedom of Information laws. AAT registrar Sian Leathem has apologised for “confusion” over her answers to questions about how the AAT answers questions. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen The problem was, the altered answers said the AAT was entirely responsible for answering the questions. Ms Leathem wrote to the committee ahead of its estimates hearing on Tuesday to explain the changes occurred while she was on annual leave in late 2020. She had spoken on the phone with a senior adviser to Mr Porter about “potential changes to the AAT’s responses to questions”, mainly that the office wanted the answers to be “less detailed and focus on the high-level processes”. Ms Leathem agreed to the changes, but the revised responses were never returned to the AAT before they were submitted to the Senate. Once she found out what had happened, in January 2021, she reviewed the answers and found a sentence had been added describing the role of the office, but otherwise believed they were “consistent with the substance of the approach I had agreed with the senior adviser” and she didn’t need to inform the committee. There were five versions of the answers passed between the AAT, the Attorney-General’s Department and Mr Porter’s office. Senator Carr accused Ms Leathem of misleading the Senate, a serious charge that could lead to her being found in contempt of Parliament. “They don’t want to answer questions about how they answer questions,” he told this masthead. On Tuesday, Ms Leathem told the committee she regarded what had happened with the two answers that got changed as “a stuff-up”. “I can only offer my apologies for my role in the confusion and the fact there was not an adherence to the process,” she said. “In the sense, Senator, that they refer to the AAT settling the responses, I accept that was not an accurate representation in relation to those particular questions. “We had not appreciated it would be interpreted as misleading.” Senator Carr pointed out one of the answers said the AAT was responsible for finalising and submitting answers to Senate questions. “If it’s not an accurate reflection of the process, why was it then not misleading?” he asked Ms Leathem on Tuesday. She said the answer “was given honestly in the context of many, many hundreds of questions on notice”. “[It] represented the process that has been followed with the exception of these particular two, which from my perspective was a stuff-up because it didn’t follow the process,” she said. Senator Carr didn’t see this as good enough. “It’s not the vast majority of cases that we expect accuracy, we expect accuracy in all occasions,” he told her. “The original responses were changed substantially and finalised by the former attorney-general’s office.” The tribunal also came under fire for its recent attempt to keep secret details about the workload of its members. Ms Leathem had claimed the information should not be released in part because it could bring the tribunal into disrepute and risked harming the mental health of members. After the committee rejected that claim, the AAT released the information. Liberal senator Sarah Henderson, the committee’s chair, opened proceedings by scolding Ms Leathem for the initial claim to secrecy. “We were most disappointed to receive the public interest immunity claim in the form it was received,” she said.",,smh

"Canadian government should have moved more quickly on release of two Michaels, Chrétien says",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/chretien-trudeau-china-michaels-1.6223107?cmp=rss,,,,,,2021-10-24 16:06:55,"Former prime minister Jean Chrétien says the government should have moved earlier to resolve the issue of the detainment of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor. ""We lost three years. That is a problem, they stayed in jail for three years. So, I thought at the beginning that they should have moved earlier,"" Chrétien said in an interview airing on Rosemary Barton Live on Sunday. The former Liberal prime minister, who led Canada from 1993 to 2003, told CBC chief political correspondent Rosemary Barton he'd always had a ""special relationship"" with China. He noted that he had been called by contacts in China about the issue and spoken publicly about it before. Chrétien said during his tenure, he was able to balance a working relationship with China, especially on economic issues, while being ""very candid"" on human rights. ""They don't always agree with you, and most of the time we have to say, 'We agree to disagree,'"" he said. Jean Chrétien says the government should have moved more quickly to resolve the Kovrig and Spavor's detention. (Mathieu Theriault/CBC) Former prime minister Brian Mulroney suggested in mid-2019 that Chrétien be sent to China to help resolve the crisis sparked by the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in Canada in late 2018. Former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor were arrested in China a few hours later. Chrétien said at the time he was willing to go, and was reported in June 2019 to have floated the idea of Trudeau intervening to cancel Meng's case — his former chief of staff Eddie Goldenberg later made the case plainly The Globe and Mail , calling for ""a prisoner exchange."" Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor arrive in Canada after nearly 3-year detention in China In a book being released Tuesday, My Stories, My Times, Vol. 2, Chrétien discusses how he came to that idea and his own contention that the Meng case was always a political problem, not a legal one. 'Now they have become a power' Chrétien acknowledged that China had changed since his time leading Canada and that played a role in the government's behaviour. ""It's a different time today, I have to recognize that,"" he said. ""We had disagreements, but now they have become a power, and they're playing as a power. I'm not surprised."" Chrétien said it should always be expected that other countries would act in their own self-interest and that needed to be considered when determining strategy. The fight to free the Michaels: Canada's ambassador to the U.S. describes the months before their release Trudeau would have been 'better served' to listen to party's old guard, says Chrétien ""For us, you have to roll with the punches and take the avenues that are beneficial for your country, and slow down when the obstacle is too big,"" he said. During his interview with Barton, Chrétien also said Trudeau would have been ""better served"" in several cases if he and his government reached out to old-guard Liberals for advice, though noting he wasn't passing judgment on them. On China, he said, ""Everyone does it his own way. I had my own way and I survived with it."" You can watch full episodes of Rosemary Barton Live on CBC Gem, the CBC's streaming service.",,cbc

Labor senator Kim Carr chastised the continued prosecution, asking how it could remain in the public interest after an ACT court found Mr Collaery was motivated by justice and Witness K received a three-month suspended sentence. The DPP must be satisfied that any case it prosecutes is in the public interest. Witness K's sentence and the case's impact on public confidence in the justice system are part of the prosecution's considerations about whether the case remains in the public interest. Director Sarah McNaughton told Senate estimates on Tuesday the evidence she had seen and the seriousness of the alleged conduct warranted Mr Collaery's continued prosecution.

Addressing concerns there is already a shortage of NHS staff, the health secretary said the threat of not being able to work without getting vaccinated would make them have the jab.

Both companies reined in their total spending on bonus payments in the 2021 financial year, with NBN splashing $46.5 million on staff, down from $78 million in the 2020 financial year , while Australia Post rewarded employees to the tune of $79 million compared with $92 million last year . Australia Post rewarded employees to the tune of $79 million compared with $92 million last year. Credit: Ryan Stuart This amounts to $295.9 million across the two years of the pandemic, the companies’ annual reports show. Public fury prompted a government crackdown on generous executive bonuses, with the Australian Public Service Commission recently issuing updated guidance to Commonwealth entities on senior executive bonuses, saying not to pay them unless there were “exceptional circumstances or a contractual obligation”. But a spokesman for Communications Minister Paul Fletcher said the new guidance would only apply from this financial year onward, adding remuneration paid by government-owned businesses “is a matter for their respective boards”. “NBN Co and Australia Post operate in a competitive commercial environment and have to attract and retain staff with the necessary skills and expertise to manage these complex telecommunications and logistics businesses,” the spokesman said. Australia Post executives who were forced to forgo their bonuses in 2020 at the height of the pandemic’s economic crisis and amid complaints about delivery delays, had them reinstated this year. Rodney Boys, who acted as chief executive for 10 months following Christine Holgate’s controversial exit in November, earned an annual salary of $1.8 million, including a $730,438 bonus this year. In total, the postal service’s top eight executives will share in a total of $4.8 million in bonuses this year, with each also receiving a bump in base salary. For example, executive general manager Nicole Sheffield received a $100,000 pay rise this year, plus a $714,000 bonus, taking her total salary to more than $1.5 million. Labor communications spokeswoman Michelle Rowland was scathing of executive payouts. “During a period of parcel delays and broader economic distress, the Australia Post board has stuffed excessive cash bonuses into the pockets of executives,” Ms Rowland said. “This is nothing short of a slap in the face to the Australian taxpayer.” NBN Co CEO Stephen Rue had his bonus cut back by almost 40 per cent to $734,000 this year. The pay packet of NBN boss Stephen Rue, who was one of the highest-paid public executives in 2020 earning a $3.1 million salary, took a trim to $2.6 million this year as his bonus was cut back by almost 40 per cent to $734,000. NBN executives were paid bonuses in both 2020 and 2021, although most were slightly reduced this year. New Australia Post boss Paul Graham, who began in the top job last month, will be paid a base salary of $1.4 million, with the possibility to double this through bonuses. Both Mr Graham and Mr Rue will appear at a Senate estimates hearing on Tuesday. An Australia Post spokesman said over 2000 payments were to frontline workers “who have managed through extraordinary circumstances to deliver for our customers and our community”. “Remuneration is regularly benchmarked externally and must be positioned competitively to attract, motivate and retain highly skilled senior managers. It reflects their responsibilities, performance, qualifications and experience,” the spokesman said. A spokesman for NBN Co said the $46.5 million in bonuses represented 5 per cent of the company’s wages and salary costs, and was spread across 3500 employees. “It is the communities’ judgement of our performance in providing affordable access to a ubiquitous, resilient and fit-for-purpose network which informs, in part, the board’s approach to setting annual incentives. The COVID circumstances have tested NBN Co and left our customers reassured,” the spokesman said.",,smh

He said the Australian government must challenge its closest security ally after a media report last month claimed the Central Intelligence Agency raised the prospect of capturing the WikiLeaks founder because it feared the Australian was plotting an escape of his own. Julian Assange, pictured in 2017 at the Ecuadorian embassy. Credit: AP The report, published by Yahoo News , relied on interviews with 30 former US officials and said three detailed a plot to kill Assange. Mr Hill, who is a prominent figure in the 23-member bipartisan Bring Julian Assange Home parliamentary group, said the claims should not be treated like “the James Bond premiere”. “This is real life. This is a credible allegation, not by some fringe nutty conspiracy website,” Mr Hill told an online “Politics in the Pub” event hosted by veteran journalist Mary Kostakidis earlier this month. “This is an allegation that has sources behind it, that the intelligence agency of our biggest ally and security partner was seriously drawing up plans to murder one of our own citizens in an extraterritorial killing. “It sounds kind of mad when you say it … but this is ridiculous, you can’t pretend it didn’t happen. It requires a formal discussion with the US government.” Assange, who has been detained in London’s Belmarsh Prison since Ecuador revoked his asylum in April 2019, is trying to avoid extradition to the US to face charges over the hacking and publication of classified documents on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and diplomatic cables a decade ago. His next legal hearing is set for later this month. Assange’s lawyers have repeatedly argued the US attempt to extradite him is politically motivated. Foreign Affairs Minister Marise Payne most recently raised Assange’s case with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken during her visit to Washington DC last month as part of the annual Australia-US Ministerial (AUSMIN) talks . She conveyed the federal government’s expectations that Assange was “entitled to due process, humane and fair treatment, access to proper medical and other care and access to his legal team”, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said. However, her face-to-face meeting with Mr Blinken was 11 days before the original story was published. Former US secretary of state Mike Pompeo has refused to either confirm or deny the specific allegations, but said last month Yahoo News’ sources “didn’t know what we were doing” . Former US president Donald Trump denied he ever considered having Assange assassinated, telling the news website: “It’s totally false.” Mr Hill was a part of a cross-party delegation of Australian MPs who met the US embassy’s Charge d’Affaires, Michael Goldman, in March , arguing the Australian citizen should be allowed to return home. Mr Hill said it “wasn’t hard” to get an appointment at the US embassy. “If I can do it, as an opposition backbencher, I’m sure the Foreign Minister can get in there to convey the view and ask the important question. It’s not acceptable,” he said. Mr Hill attempted to formalise the Australian Labor Party’s position on Assange at its virtual national conference earlier this year. A motion that Labor believes “it is now time for this long-drawn-out case against Julian Assange to be brought to an end” was passed.

Patrick stevedores applies to tear up pay deal for more than 1000 wharfies,https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/patrick-stevedores-applies-to-tear-up-pay-deal-for-more-than-1000-wharfies-20211026-p593ds.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_politics,,['Nick Bonyhady'],,"National stevedoring company Patrick wants to tear up its pay agreement for more than 1000 workers, escalating their dispute ahead of Christmas deliveries.",,2021-10-26 08:34:50,"National stevedoring company Patrick has asked the industrial tribunal to terminate its pay deal with 1081 of its wharfies, escalating a major dispute at one of only a few companies that unloads containers full of imports coming into Australia ahead of Christmas. The move brings the players of the 1998 Waterfront Dispute – Patrick and the Maritime Union of Australia – into a significant conflict at a time when ports locally and overseas are grappling with huge demand because of the coronavirus pandemic. Patrick CEO Michael Jovicic said the company was hamstrung by the union. Credit: Darren Pateman If the move is successful, the stevedores will lose the pay and conditions they have negotiated for years and go back to minimum industry standards unless a new deal is negotiated in the six months Patrick has promised to retain pay and leave rules after any termination. The company says it has tried for almost two years to reach a new deal with the union covering its port facilities in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Fremantle but has been stymied by unreasonable and unproductive demands, leaving its business and customers suffering. During that time there had been 220 instances of industrial action, including strikes, the company said. “Enough is enough,” said Patrick chief executive Michael Jovicic. “Our market share and business operations have suffered due to this relentless industrial campaign by the MUA and their insidious ‘jobs for the boys’ stance,” he said. “We are at the end of the road and need to have an agreement with our employees that works for our customers, and that allows us to remain competitive in the future market.” Maritime Union national secretary Paddy Crumlin called Patrick’s move an arrogant, bullying, intimidatory attack on its workers that showed why an agreement had not been reached yet. “It is being done in such a way as to try to defame the workforce in a most disgraceful fashion by distorting public perceptions of a legally sanctioned bargaining process,” Mr Crumlin said. “The disagreements between the two parties are easily resolved and have been achieved within the industry with other stevedoring companies without them resorting to this type of character assassination.” Among the enterprise agreement provisions Patrick says will be removed are rules that require it to effectively get the union’s approval for new hires, rather than hiring on merit alone. “We have presented the MUA with an attractive national offer on top of their already very generous agreement including a 10 per cent pay increase across four years, coupled with protections addressing concerns over the use of casuals and job security,” Mr Jovicic said. The other major port operators, DP World and Hutchison Ports reached deals earlier this year with the maritime union, which is a part of the much larger Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union. University of Sydney labour law Professor Shae McCrystal said the Fair Work Commission can terminate agreements where they are past their nominal expiry date, and termination is in the “public interest”. Professor McCrystal said termination was “quite a significant threat” because even the spectre of it put employers in a more powerful bargaining position. Australian Council of Trade Unions secretary Sally McManus accused Patrick of using loopholes in an attempt to cut wages and rights. “MUA members are no strangers to this type of behaviour from Patrick, who should return to the bargaining table and respect their workers,” Ms McManus said. Attorney-General Michaelia Cash said the government was concerned about the damage industrial action could do to the economy but made clear the matter was ultimately for the independent Fair Work Commission and the parties. “Just when communities are coming out of lockdowns and businesses are reopening their doors, this industrial action could not come at a worse time,” said Senator Cash, who is also industrial relations minister. “This action will be felt in Australia’s two most populous cities as they emerge from prolonged lockdowns, only to be hit by more disruption and economic harm.” Former prime minister John Howard described the 1998 Waterfront Dispute as “the most bitterly fought domestic issue of my whole time as prime minister”. That year Patrick sacked its 1400 unionised workers and replaced them with contracted workers. The Howard government backed the move, which the company said was essential to increase productivity and stop the union controlling the wharves. After a bitter campaign of sometimes aggressive pickets and legal action, the company ultimately kept many of its workers on and the union agreed to efficiency improvements.",,smh

At the beginning of question time on Tuesday, Mr McCormack was seen pointing and gesturing at the man who replaced him in June , following the publication of a story by news.com.au detailing Mr McCormack’s displeasure with his colleague, Queensland MP George Christensen, over a social media post on Monday night. Nationals MP Michael McCormack was seen pointing and gesturing at Barnaby Joyce at the start of question time. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen The bizarre video was posted on Facebook by Mr Christensen showing Queensland senator Matt Canavan’s face superimposed on that of the Terminator, who shoots people, including a police officer. It was captioned: “This is pretty much Senator Matthew Canavan dealing with the disastrous net zero push today.” Tension within the junior Coalition partner has been high since the change of leadership, with both Mr Christensen and Senator Canavan becoming more outspoken over Coalition policy, in particular the target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. Mr McCormack, whose son is a NSW police officer, phoned Mr Christensen about the post on Monday night to express his displeasure and then sent a series of messages to the “Nats Chat” group on encrypted messaging app Signal, described it as “beyond the pale”. “One of the people shot is a uniformed police officer. As the father of a police officer, I find this abhorrent. This is not the way we should be debating climate change policy,” he wrote. “I appreciate it is the Terminator and the uniformed officer in the movie is not the good guy, but we have to be better than this, surely … I’ve spoken to George and let him know how I feel.” In a response in the group chat, Senator Canavan said he was OK with the post. “As you say, the ‘cop’ is actually a shapeshifting, T-1000 Terminator model sent from the future back in time to kill John Connor. He deserved to get smoked for the good of humanity,” he said. The leak of the private messages to the media just before question time enraged Mr McCormack, who demanded Mr Joyce raise the issue with the leaker, who he believed to be Senator Canavan. Mr McCormack demanded Mr Joyce raise the issue of leaked messages from a Nationals chat group to the media with the leaker. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen Mr Joyce told this masthead he was unaware of the publication of the story before the confrontation with Mr McCormack in the House of Representatives. He returned to speak to Mr McCormack about seven minutes after their initial discussion. “He had every right to be angry,” Mr Joyce said. “It is clearly not acceptable. I hadn’t seen the story when he first raised it with me. So I went away to discover what he was talking about and then I returned to discuss it with him. It is not acceptable and I have made that clear.” It is the second damaging leak from within the Nationals this week, with The Sun-Herald revealing at the weekend MPs were fuming after details of their list of demands for agreeing to a net zero emissions target were canvassed publicly before they had seen it. Messages sent by Senator Canavan to his Nationals colleagues on Thursday night and Friday morning suggested a media story on Friday about the party wanting a socio-economic safety valve for the regions “reads like it has been planted by PMO”. Mr Joyce returned to speak to Mr McCormack after reading the story, saying “he had every right to be angry”. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen Mr McCormack said he was concerned about the leaked text because he “did the right thing”. “It wasn’t meant to go public and I am disappointed that it did,” Mr McCormack said. “It is grist for the media mill but it serves no purpose in getting regional Australians what they want: more jobs and better services.

Israel views the West Bank as the biblical and historical heartland of the Jewish people.

Investigators soon to finalise Australian Workers Union membership probe,https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/investigators-soon-to-finalise-australian-workers-union-membership-probe-20211025-p592x4.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_politics,,['Nick Bonyhady'],,"The Registered Organisations Commission has been examining whether the influential union failed to remove unfinancial members, inflating its numbers.",,2021-10-26 07:47:52,"Federal regulators are nearing the end of a long-running inquiry into whether a major Australian union, whose membership includes senior Labor figures Bill Shorten and Jim Chalmers, inflated its size over many years by failing to remove unfinancial members. The Registered Organisations Commission in February launched a formal investigation into the Australian Workers Union, which represents about 71,000 workers across industries including, energy, civil construction and agriculture. AWU national secretary Daniel Walton said he was looking forward to the investigation concluding. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen Membership numbers are critical to all unions as a measure of power but especially those affiliated with the Labor Party because they translate into votes in forums that can influence party positions and policy. In a statement, the commission said the investigation stemmed from anomalies in the union’s reports between 2009 and 2017 and would examine whether it properly purged members who had fallen behind on their dues or stopped paying altogether. It is also checking whether the union complied with laws requiring it to keep proper records for at least seven years. Issues with the AWU’s membership figures have been in the spotlight since 2016 but the commission’s annual report notes it expects its investigation to be finished by December this year. That could either lead to a lawsuit against the union if the regulator believes it has breached the law, opening the door to substantial fines for the well-connected union or, if the regulator concludes no laws have been broken, questions about the utility of its investigation. “These very long-running investigations into historic matters have been extremely well resourced and well publicised,” the union’s national secretary Daniel Walton said. “We look forward to them concluding soon.” Mr Walton ascended to the union’s top job in 2016 after many of the alleged issues occurred. He said the union had engaged independent auditors to check its systems, automated its membership database to remove human error, offered to let the commission inspect its systems and clarified its rules with approval from the Fair Work Commission. “I’m hugely proud of the many people in our team who worked tirelessly over the past couple of years to get our systems, structures, and records right,” Mr Walton said. The union’s declared membership has plummeted over the last decade, from 139,329 in 2012 to 71,464 at the end of 2020, a figure roughly stable on the preceding handful of years. The current investigation covers all union branches except Victoria. The union was separately penalised $148,100 by the Federal Court last year for an “apparently fraudulent” series of deals in that state struck with employers and associations between 2008 and 2013. Under those arrangements, the union signed up members whose fees were paid by the employers and associations to the tune of almost $500,000, sometimes under the banner of payments for other union services, but were not told by the union that they had become part of the AWU. “Those people became unwitting subjects through whom the AWU (or its Victorian branch) artificially inflated its membership levels over a period of many years,” Federal Court Justice John Snaden found. Those deals were struck principally by former Victorian AWU secretary Cesar Melhem, who admitted failing to properly discharge his duties as a leader of the union and was fined $20,950 in a separate court decision in 2019. In a third investigation, the commission is looking into whether donations by the AWU to the activist group GetUp in 2006 and other political donations were unlawful. That investigation, launched in 2017, was stopped by the Federal Court two years later in a decision that also required the regulator to return documents seized in a raid of the union’s offices. In November last year that court decision was overturned, allowing the investigation to continue.",,smh

"" Facebook has reduced itself to a Fakebook,"" Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said while raising the purported leaked internal reports of the social media giant on not initiating action against hate speech posts on its platform in India. There was no response from Facebook India to the allegations. The Congress leader also alleged that Facebook was acting as an ally of the ruling BJP and pushing its agenda. Khera referred to research documents by whistleblower Frances Haugen, who has worked at Facebook, and alleged that it took no decisive action against the perpetrators of such hate posts in Hindi and Bengali. He alleged that Facebook's internal reports have identified fake accounts with over a million impressions, yet it did nothing about it. ""We demand a JPC probe to look into the role of Facebook in influencing our elections,"" Khera told reporters. He alleged that Facebook was trying to ""'compromise and undermine our democracy in trying to shape through fake posts the opinions of people""'. He alleged that BJP workers and those of its affiliates have infiltrated into the structure and functioning of Facebook. ""What right does Facebook have to push a particular ideology through fake posts, pictures and a narrative. It is shocking how only 0.2 per cent of hate speech is removed by Facebook, which despite making the most money from India, does not have the mechanism to filter posts in Hindi or Bengali,"" he said. Khera said just nine percent of users in India are in English and yet they do not have systems to filter the posts of regional languages. Alleging that the role of Facebook during Delhi riots and West Bengal elections has been under suspicion, he said ""The role of Facebook can no longer be dismissed as an error of omission as they are knowingly furthering the agenda of the ruling party and its ideology which is hate-filled, bigotry and dividing society."" ""Why should we not accuse Facebook of interfering in our elections by influencing the voting behaviour of its consumers. This is serious election fraud and this is serious interference in our elections by a foreign company,"" he alleged. ""Why is Facebook quiet on these accusations which have come from within it. Why is the government silent on this, just because it suits their agenda and Facebook has become a tool in the hands of the BJP and its affiliates,"" he asked. Khera alleged that in the wake of an expose by its own former employee, there are many questions that Facebook and the government need to answer. ""Despite knowing all of this, why hasn't Facebook designated RSS and Bajrang Dal as 'dangerous organisations' based on its own internal reports? He also alleged that internal reports and recommendations of Facebook's security team went against the recommendations of Facebook's safety team, insofar as they prioritised commercial interests over the safety of Indian citizens, and yet no action has been taken by the Government. ""Doesn't this clearly implicate the presence of a 'quid pro quo',"" he asked. Internal documents at Facebook show ""a struggle with misinformation, hate speech and celebrations of violence"" in India, the company's biggest market, with researchers at the social media giant pointing out that there are groups and pages ""replete with inflammatory and misleading anti-Muslim content"" on its platform, US media reports have said.

Coalition spent $13m on climate campaign,https://www.newcastleherald.com.au/story/7482486/coalition-spent-13m-on-climate-campaign/?src=rss,,['Georgie Moore'],,,,2021-10-25 04:39:01,"The Morrison government has spent nearly $13 million promoting its climate credentials to voters while refusing to release modelling underpinning its plan to cut emissions. The $12.9 million spend includes more than $488,000 looking at public attitudes towards climate change and market testing the coalition's ""positive energy campaign"" launched in September. Labor wants government officials to hand over findings of market research into the campaign. ""It's subject to cabinet consideration so I need to check on that,"" the head of the industry department's climate change division, Helen Bennett, told a Senate estimates hearing on Monday. The campaign, including TV and radio ads, was developed because ""the public wanted to hear more about what the government is doing to reduce emissions"". Meanwhile, the government has refused to release modelling underpinning a 2050 target, begrudgingly agreed to by the Nationals, on the grounds of cabinet confidentiality. Energy Minister Angus Taylor flagged a public interest immunity claim on the modelling requested last week by Nationals senator Matt Canavan because it informed or was the subject of cabinet deliberations. Appearing on the minister's behalf, Senator Zed Seselja told the hearing the plan was based on existing policies and would be detailed ahead of the COP26 summit starting in six days. ""What you're asking for is for this committee to be able to effectively interrogate the internal deliberations of cabinet and that has not been the approach in the past,"" he said. The Climate Change Authority was not asked to advise the government about updating its 2030 or 2050 targets. ""It was, once upon a time, part of our statutory responsibilities to advise on these matters but that is not presently the case,"" the authority's chief executive Brad Archer told the hearing. Its involvement in COP26 will be limited to running two events, one around global trade and investment trends and another on building carbon offset markets in the Indo-Pacific. Industry department deputy secretary Jo Evans confirmed Australia was not changing its 2030 target from a 26 to 28 per cent reduction on 2005 levels. ""That target which was set at 2015 and which is for 2030, is not changing,"" she said. Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young described the in-principle deal for net-zero emissions by 2050 as hostage negotiations between Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce. ""It seems to everybody else that the prime minister has no idea what he's doing and Barnaby Joyce is calling all the shots,"" she said. A majority of the junior coalition partner agreed on Sunday to in-principle support for net-zero emissions by 2050 after vetoing an increase to the 2030 target.

Since the Taliban seized Kabul and took control in August, it has been increasingly difficult to get people out. Canada ended its airlift mission from Kabul near the end of August as the U.S. was completing its own withdrawal from the country.

Do I contact human smugglers? Countries are actively deporting people back to Afghanistan,” she said. “This is a policy change. This is the explanation of whether you qualify.

Goshko offered the assessment in a wide-ranging interview as the United Kingdom prepares to host what are seen as pivotal United Nations climate talks in Scotland next month, known as COP26. Story continues below advertisement Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faced criticism from his political opponents and from environmental groups during the recent federal election because Canada’s carbon emissions actually rose from 2015 to 2019, the most recent years for which data is available. While new Liberal policies might have driven down emissions in the two years since then, the current data has fuelled the narrative that Canada’s reputation on fighting climate change has been diminished since Trudeau’s 2015 participation in the Paris climate agreement in the weeks after he won power. Not so, in Britain’s view, said Goshko. “I think that there’s no question it’s hard to do what needs to be done to reach our climate goals. A transition to a net-zero economy is really, really tricky. And I think the important thing, as far as Canada is concerned, is the commitment is there,” said Goshko. 2:17 Report: Canada set to fall short on targets for carbon emissions Report: Canada set to fall short on targets for carbon emissions – Oct 6, 2021 Net zero is the term that means no new emissions would be added to Earth’s atmosphere, with nature or technology capturing any that are produced.

Those new commitments, as well as Canada’s partnership with Germany to help deliver US$100 billion in financing to poorer countries to help them fight climate change, mean that “Canada’s shown huge leadership,” Goshko said.

Despite China’s voracious appetite for energy, including the coal-fired variety, Goshko said it is also the world’s largest investor in renewable energy, which makes it a valuable partner in fighting climate change.

Raab was an early supporter of Canada’s international effort to create a declaration against arbitrary detention by states, she said. And Canada was an eager participant in international efforts to criticize China for human rights violations in Hong Kong and bring in sanctions over abuses in its Xinjiang province against Muslim Uyghurs, she said, undaunted by the fact China was holding two of its nationals in apparent retaliation for the arrest of Chinese executive Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. extradition warrant.

Read more: Canada’s COVID-19 benefits: A look at what’s expiring and what’s new Aleksander Saiyan, the operations director for Toronto Dance Salsa, said that if he hadn’t made use of those programs, his dance studio would have been shut down. Story continues below advertisement “There’s no way we could have covered the rent, we would have went into a massive debt,” said Saiyan, who made use of the CRB for himself and other government programs for his business. Dance studios, much like gyms and exercise spaces, were widely considered “grey areas” in what provincial governments decided to shut down during their pandemic-induced lockdowns. While Ontario’s provincial government continues its gradual re-opening of the economy, including most recently an announcement of full capacity for gyms and restaurants set for this Monday, Saiyan said business is still just a fraction of what it was prior to the pandemic. 4:38 Pandemic rent and wage subsidies coming to an end Pandemic rent and wage subsidies coming to an end Saiyan says the business is now just operating on little more than 30 per cent of the revenue it was earning pre-COVID, and that every “penny” and more that they’ve saved up in previous years has already gone forward to cover bills like rent, electricity and wages. Story continues below advertisement “So it is scary, extremely scary, and we wholeheartedly depend on this to recover,” said Saiyan. “And I’m hoping that in January, February, things will get better and we start to go to some kind of normal.” In an announcement Thursday, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland said that new programs would be put in place to replace the pandemic measures. The new Tourism and Hospitality Recovery Program and Hardest Hit Business Recovery Program are set to come into effect Sunday, according to Freeland.

The CRB, which was formerly known as the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), will also be replaced by a more targeted program called the Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit (CWLB). While the new programs are said to be more targeted to those that need them the most, many are concerned that it won’t be enough to keep them and their businesses afloat. David Macdonald, a senior economist for the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, wrote that as many 1.5 million people could be directly impacted by the replacement of those programs — most of whom won’t have another source of income or support. Story continues below advertisement 2:18 Uncertainty as Ottawa ends wage and rent subsidies Uncertainty as Ottawa ends wage and rent subsidies Of that number, about 900,000 workers would lose support from the CRB’s eligibility and income cut, while over 640,000 workers could see their jobs in jeopardy over the CERS and CEWS cuts. “The real elephant in the room is CRB support for self-employed workers,” said Macdonald. “While several of the other programs have seen significant decline in take-up recently, the CRB has not.” Those interested in the CRB’s replacement, the CWLB, would only be eligible for it once a province or city imposes a COVID-19 lockdown, Macdonald wrote. “At this point, there doesn’t seem to be any place in Canada under lockdown and so there would be no one eligible for the CWLB at the time of writing.” Read more: Don’t stop federal COVID-19 benefits, businesses say as expiration nears Story continues below advertisement There are currently no provinces or cities in lockdown, but Freeland defended the new measures — adding that temporary local lockdowns were “still a possibility” in the months to come. “Our emergency support measures were always designed to be temporary to get us through the crisis,” she said. “We’re now in a new phase, one that is very different from the darkest days in our fight against COVID. We have recovered lost jobs.” Small business owners have previously called on the federal government to not stop COVID-19 benefits ahead of their expiration — calling it a lifeline for their livelihoods. Rina Camarra, the manager of Mastro’s Restaurant in Toronto, told Global News in September that her business was on the wage subsidy program over the months-long pandemic. 5:33 Looming expiry of pandemic financial supports leaves small businesses wary Looming expiry of pandemic financial supports leaves small businesses wary “It’s not an easy task for us to run a business nowadays,” said Camarra.

What we take in is not enough.” Speaking on the Roy Green Show on Saturday, Dan Kelly, the president and CEO of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said that he sympathizes with the deputy prime minister’s “difficult job” — though he begged the question of whether or not the economy is truly ready for the rollback of subsidies. <iframe src=” https://omny.fm/shows/roy-green-show/cdn-small-business-on-fed-on-gov-moves-decisions/embed” ; width=”100%” height=”180px” frameborder=”0″></iframe> “We’re already hearing from a large number of fairly panicked business owners,” said Kelly.

Police Minister Bheki Cele during nedia briefing where he gave deatil on policing during the COVID-19 lockdown. Tuesday, 22 September 2020: Picture: Twitter/@GovernmentZA Bheki Cele Political killings Security cluster Elections 2021 Email Print Tweet Share Theto Mahlakoana | 7 hours ago JOHANNESBURG - The justice, crime prevention and security cluster has on Monday confirmed that eight politically connected people were murdered in the lead up to next Monday’s polls. South Africa has been stained with politically motivated killings over the years with the problem, which was mainly prevalent in KwaZulu-Natal, spreading to other provinces. This has raised concerns about the use of violence to deal with the competition. Police Minister Bheki Cele said six people were killed in KwaZulu-Natal including the recent murder of African National Congress councillor candidate Siyabonga Mkhize. But there were other cases too: “In the Western Cape, the councillors have been killed there too.” The police recorded about 33 political murders in KZN between 2016 and June 2017 with three other ANC councillor candidates gunned down just days before the 2016 local government elections. Cele said there were other potentially politically related crimes committed including the attempted murder of a councillor in KwaDukuza. WATCH: Ahead of 1 Nov polls, police to bolster presence in violence hotspots SAFE, SECURE ELECTION Cele has assured South Africans that the security cluster is capable of ensuring a safe and secure election. This time next week, South Africans will be casting their ballots in the local government elections, and questions around safety have been raised, given the recent, politically motivated killings in parts of the country. The violence and looting seen in July in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng is also still a concern for many citizens. Cele said despite a police station in the Northern Cape being robbed of guns and ammunition recently, the police could deliver. He said this was an exception: “We have 1,158 police stations in the Republic of South Africa, and we are talking about one that was targeted. Criminals now want to take their chances.” Thousands of police officers will be deployed country wide to secure voting stations and maintain law and order on election day with others already stationed in problematic areas. While Cele would not divulge the number of officials, he said the Western Cape, KZN, Gauteng and the Western Cape had been identified as hotspots. The army will also be stepping in to assist the police. Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS or Android device.",,ewn

Gottlieb says kids could start getting COVID vaccine as soon as November 4,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-vaccine-kids-ages-5-11-november-gottlieb-face-the-nation/,,,,Gottlieb said the Biden administration is making the effort to push the vaccine directly into pediatricians' offices.,,2021-10-25 19:45:44,"Former FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb predicted Sunday on ""Face the Nation"" that the Biden administration could begin rolling out COVID-19 vaccines for children as soon as November 4 or 5, right after a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention panel will decide whether to allow Pfizer's vaccine for children ages 5 to 11. Gottlieb said the Biden administration is making the effort to push the vaccine directly into pediatricians' offices. Pfizer, which Gottlieb sits on the board, is developing a small tray that carries 10 vials at a time and a storage container that is small enough for small to medium-sized pediatrician's office to stock the vaccine and deliver it. Transcript: Dr. Scott Gottlieb on ""Face the Nation"", October 24, 2021 ""It could be stored in a regular refrigerator for up to 10 weeks. It was purposely packaged that way,"" Gottlieb said. ""And so, the idea is to try to get it into pediatrician's offices because we know that getting children vaccinated is a much more consultative endeavor."" Gottlieb said many parents may not want to drag their children into a mass vaccination site or pharmacy and would rather have their children in the comfort of their own pediatrician's office. Dr. Scott Gottlieb on ""Face the Nation"" on October 24, 2021. CBS News Pfizer and BioNTech asked the FDA to authorize the vaccine for children 5 to 11 in early October. On Friday, scientists at the FDA said that the likely benefits of giving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine to 5- to 11-year-olds far outweigh the potential risks, such as heart inflammation. On Tuesday, the FDA's advisory panel will meet to review the data and evidence of the vaccine's safety and effectiveness in children, and vote on whether the FDA should authorize the use. ""If Pfizer does get the authorization on Tuesday from FDA, even before the CDC votes on this on November 2 and 3, they'll start to ship it into the supply chain so it will be available for use once there is a hopefully positive vote from CDC, said Gottlieb. So, it could be as early as November 4 and 5 that you can go into some locations and get your child vaccinated,"" he said. Although kids are at a lower risk of having a severe outcome due to contracting the virus, many have been hospitalized. According to the CDC , at least 731 children have died from COVID-19, including 160 deaths in the 5- to 11-year-old age range. Coronavirus Crisis More Can I get a booster shot?

Coalition support weakened by Nationals’ climate policy disagreement,https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/coalition-support-weakened-by-nationals-climate-policy-disagreement-20211025-p592wt.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_politics,,['David Crowe'],,The Coalition has paid a political price for an extended dispute among the Nationals over whether to commit to net zero emissions by 2050.,,2021-10-25 21:00:00,"A swing against the Nationals has weakened support for the federal government during a high-stakes argument over climate policy, cutting the Coalition’s primary vote from 39 to 37 per cent. Labor has increased its primary vote from 31 to 34 per cent over the past month while the Greens have lifted their support from 10 to 11 per cent, highlighting a shift among voters that throws the government on the defensive. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has kept his edge over Labor leader Anthony Albanese as preferred prime minister, with a lead of 44 to 26 per cent, but the Coalition has paid a political price for an extended dispute among the Nationals over whether to commit to net zero emissions by 2050. The exclusive results in the Resolve Political Monitor, conducted for The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age by research company Resolve Strategic, show the swing against the government was wholly due to a cut in support for the Nationals from 5 to 3 per cent. The Liberals increased their primary vote from 34 to 35 per cent but this was not enough to make up for the hit to the Nationals, leading to a fall in the overall Coalition vote from 39 to 37 per cent after rounding to the nearest whole number. Resolve director Jim Reed said the result took the Coalition vote to its lowest point since the surveys began in April and represented a swing to Labor since the election. “The last month sees a flow of votes from the Coalition to Labor and the Greens, but this is all coming from the Nationals,” he said. “The Liberals have actually gained a point, but the Nationals have lost 40 percent of their vote share in just a few weeks. When you’re starting from a modest base, that’s statistically significant.” Mr Reed said the result was the strongest for Labor to date but cautioned that the two-party result after preferences was still “too close to call” after considering the margin of error. Because the Resolve Political Monitor gives respondents the option of making unprompted remarks about parties and leaders, the findings on primary vote came with repeated signs that climate change was an issue for many in their decisions. “Everything about the vote movement, the changes in the ratings for the leaders and party brands and the comments submitted by voters is telling us that the Nationals’ loss is about their prevarication on the 2050 net zero decision,” Mr Reed said. “Most of Australia supports it, most Queenslanders support it, most regional and rural voters support it, and most Nationals’ voters support it.” “The majority of Nationals voters made up their minds on this a while ago and they’re making their way to the next pub, and it looks like a bunch of them have got fed up waiting for those in the Nationals who are still having a punch-up in the last pub’s car park.” The Resolve Political Monitor was conducted from October 21 to 24 and asked 1603 voters about their views in online questions put in a random order to avoid a “donkey vote” with the results. It has a maximum margin of error of 2.5 per cent. The shift in popular support came during a period of federal debate on climate policy , the vaccine rollout, the end of the ban on Australians travelling overseas, the move by NSW to end hotel quarantine, the likely powers of a new commonwealth integrity commission and a political storm over hidden donations to former attorney-general Christian Porter. Voters expressed their views during the time Mr Morrison was waiting for Mr Joyce and his party room to decide their stance on the climate target but the responses were received before the Nationals announced support for net zero shortly before 6pm on Sunday. Support for Pauline Hanson’s One Nation fell from 4 to 3 per cent over the month while support for independent candidates was unchanged at 9 per cent and support for others slipped from 7 to 5 per cent. This meant 28 per cent of voters favoured a choice outside the Coalition, Labor and the Greens, a slight fall from 30 per cent the previous month. The results reveal signs that more voters are thinking of swinging from one choice to another, with 32 per cent describing themselves as “uncommitted” with their support. Because the Resolve Political Monitor asks voters to nominate their primary votes in the same way they would write ‘1’ on the ballot papers for the lower house at an election, there is no undecided category in the results, a key difference with some other surveys. It also assigns vote to the Liberals and Nationals depending on electorate, including in Queensland according to which LNP party contested the seat at the last election. Mr Morrison retained a strong lead as preferred prime minister, favoured by 44 per cent of voters compared to 26 per cent for Labor leader Anthony Albanese, with 30 per cent undecided. The gap between the two has narrowed to 18 percentage points in recent months from 24 points in May. Asked to rate Mr Morrison’s performance, 47 per cent said it was good while 43 per cent considered it poor. After rounding, this produced a positive rating of 4 percentage points after rounding. Asked to rate Mr Albanese, 31 per cent considered his performance to be good while 41 per cent said it was poor, producing a net negative rating of 10 percentage points. Mr Albanese improved on this measure compared to last month because the number of voters who said he was doing a poor job fell from 47 to 41 per cent. In a sign the Prime Minister has a higher profile that can produce an advantage on personal measures, only 10 per cent of voters were undecided about Mr Morrison’s performance while 29 per cent were undecided on Mr Albanese.

APBoris Johnson has been warned Plan B would cost the UK up to £18bn over five months[/caption] GettyInternal documents raise questions about the benefits of vaccine passports[/caption] And he’s been warned be scientists that those measures might only make a marginal impact on the spread of the virus anyway. Business minister Paul Scully said the Government is aware of the cost of “stop start” lockdowns and doesn’t want to “stifle” the recovery. Leaked papers drawn up officials at the Cabinet Office and Treasury predict Plan B would cost up to £3.6bn a month. Whitehall mandarins are working on the “assumption” new restrictions would stay in place until March next year. According to the documents, obtained by Politico, working from home would be cause the biggest hit to businesses.

Rylan Clark wakes after boozy birthday bash to find celeb pal still in his home Officials say telling people to stay away from offices would only have a moderately positive impact on cutting transmission. They also warn the PM vaccine passports would make a negligible difference to stopping the virus whilst having a “high impact” on the economy. The research says Covid papers would reduce overall transmission across the country by just 1-5 percent. That’s because though even they cut spread at mass events by 40-45 per cent, only 2-13% of new infections occur at such venues. And mandarins warn imposing vaccine passports could have “wider impacts” and further deepen the UK’s supply chain crisis. The paper says they are “likely to have a positive impact in reducing transmission, although it is not possible to say accurately by how much”. Officials said reimposing a full lockdown, which the PM insists he’s not considering, would have a much greater effect on squashing the virus. ‘No sense’ Plan B needed A Government spokesman said: “We knew the coming months would be challenging, which is why we set out our autumn and winter plan last month. “Plan B ensures we are ready, should we need to act, to avoid an unsustainable rise in hospitalisations which would put unsustainable pressure on the NHS. “The presumptions put forward do not reflect government policy. There is no planned five-month timeline.” Separate Whitehall research, seen by the Telegraph, calculates vaccine passports could cost the events sector up to £2.3bn over six months. It warns bringing them in would simply push people from larger, well ventilated venues like football stadiums into crowded pubs. Mr Scully insisted the PM still sees no plan to trigger Plan B as hospitalisations haven’t risen sharply in line with cases. He said: “We saw the concerns of businesses when we had the stop-start nature this time last year and we knew the cost to business of that. “That’s why we’re taking every measure to make sure we don’t choke down on the recovery, that we allow businesses to trade fully. “We don’t want to be stifling the recovery. So there’s no sense that there’s anything at the moment that’s suggesting Plan B is needed.” Most read in News GREAT FRIGHT Inside abandoned zoo with remains of great white SHARK floating in tank YEARS OF ABUSE Dad held knife to abused wife's throat before she killed him, says daughter PAY RISE £1,000 a year boost to wages as Rishi hikes minimum wage to £9.50 an hour 'WE'LL MISS YOU' Tributes to 'loved' teen boys after pair stabbed to death as 8 arrested JEALOUS RAGE Mum battered neighbour with bat & called girl 'ugly ginger ****' in lover row DRIVEN TO DESPAIR Frustrated driver tells eco-protester ‘I hope everyone you know gets cancer’ Covid cases across the UK dropped for the fourth day in a row yesterday and stood at 36,100.

The Matatiele-based party used its four seats to assist the ANC gain control of the Ekurhuleni Metro in 2016 where the ANC set up a five-a-side committee to deliberate over the matter. But the AIC said now, after numerous delays, it would take the governing party to the Constitutional Court as it had failed to fulfil its end of a deal to incorporate the town of Matatiele into KwaZulu-Natal from the Eastern Cape. The AIC was born out of efforts to reverse the demarcation. AIC spokesperson Aubrey Mhlongo said while the relationship with the ANC had shown good governance in Ekurhuleni, the ANC had not been honest and needed to be taught a lesson. “They haven’t fulfilled their end of the bargain. In other words, what they promised to do for us never happened. Nonetheless, I think the negotiations will be back on the table if that need arises.” Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS or Android device.",,ewn

He was the first Senator in the 9th senate to come out publicly to make known to his people , his action plan on how he wanted to represent his people at the Senate. Ever then, he has remained steadfast in pursuing the thematic areas contained in the action plan and remained a reference point to many in the country. He does not belong to the class of a typical Nigeria politician that must manipulate or engage in aberrations to gain relevance, he is indeed the breath of fresh air from bad politics , the people of Niger East desired him so much, and they examplified this by voting him as their senator massively. Since he started representing Niger East at the senate, it has been obviously clear that he has one of the deepest constituency engagement and has made it article of faith to ensure that the people come first above any other considerations. Though , he is not in executive position, he has intervened in areas of employment generation, skill acquisition, scholarship and provision of infrastructures, apart from his robust contributions at the upper chamber of the national assembly. Sani Musa popularly refer to as Sani 313, is politically a household name not only in his constituency, Niger state but all over Nigeria , this is so , because he has a refine approach to politics, yet he has broken barriers for his people‘s and Nigeria‘s progress. His qualities are numerous but the personality of Sani 313, is chiefly of a person who understands the true meaning of social contract in a democratic set up ; to the extent that he easily decipher the ways of the people and go by their ways for them to achieve their individual and collective aspirations and goals . It does not therefore come as a surprise that his name is in the news as the kind of Chairman his party; All Progressives Congress APC needs now. His vibrancy, outreach, Pedigree , refinement , and many other qualities distinguished him from those so far mentioned for the job. His emergence will be the bridge the party needed to reach the desire level. The party formed from three or more legacy parties , sure needed a cosmopolitan chairman like Sani Musa, Many have argued that Sani Musa humility, astuteness, mental and emotional reflexes suit the kind of the qualities all well meaning members of APC should be looking for, to take the party to the desired level and deliver at all levels in 2023. President Muhammadu Buhari came to power as the presidential candidate of the newly formed All Progressives Congress (APC) and barely one year it was formed , in 2015 election was won , since then three chairmen of older generations have been produced, on this premise, apart from the sterling leadership qualities of Senator Sani Musa, his emergence will bring about the desired renaissance for younger Nigerians often refered to as the leaders of tommorow; to have hope after all , as Sani Musa pedigree stand him out to serve as the bridge There is no doubting the fact that the party needed to mobilize younger Nigerians to bring about the new order the people desired from a ruling party. The key to the prosperity of the party is in mobilizing younger Nigerians to accept the basic principles of the party for national growth and development. Sani Musa emergence will also demostrate the fact that APC is not a party that recycle leaders around certain class , the President has been clear about bequeathing on Nigeria legacy of sustainable democracy thus the need for a shift from former Governors to young and active politican who is abreast with current political party democracy and core democratic dynamics like Sanu Musa has no gain saying. The ruling APC amid daunting challenges has substantially achieved in terms development and growth since 2015 to date hence President Buhari desire to sustain the legacies, as a Senator who has been part of these laudable feats , sani Musa is in a position to provide the needed leadership and sustain it. No fewer than 15 aspirants comprising of former governors, former and serving senators have been mentioned but one can make bold to state that the pedigree of Senator Sani Musa stands him out of the park as some one who has not lost out in affairs of honour. Sani Musa has been a committed APC member, in his home state Niger state , he has the capacity to carry everybody along without incline to create or form tendencies , this has put him in a better stead than other candidates to give APC a united front devoid of any alliance within the party, that will make it vulnerable to implosion The record is there to show that from inception of APC , Sani Musa paid alot of sacrifice and has been committed financially to the party without expecting any political patronage ; such loyalty is rare in a system where people are committed because they are expecting something in return . Infact he is a good advertisement as a true Progressive. It is based on this pedigree that he remained invaluable in the senate , where he is the chairman of the senate service committee, a very sensitive committee , this has demostrated his influence even among his colleagues and beyond. Consequently as the preparation to the national convention of the party gathers momentum the APC will find in Senator Mohammed Sani Musa what is needed to make the party maintain her dominance in electoral victory , and he is so recommended for the challenging job. – Nma Kolo is Special Adviser to the Niger State Governor on Strategy and Political Matters and an APC Stalwart in Niger State",,leadership

Modi govt's wrong policies responsible for farmers' plight: Congress,https://www.business-standard.com/article/politics/modi-govt-s-wrong-policies-responsible-for-farmers-plight-congress-121102501536_1.html,,,,"The Congress on Monday alleged that the Modi government's ""wrong policies"" are responsible for the plight of farmers who are ""not getting even the cost of their produce""",,2021-10-25 17:40:00,"The Congress on Monday alleged that the Modi government's ""wrong policies"" are responsible for the plight of farmers who are ""not getting even the cost of their produce"". Congress general secretary and chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala claimed that as per rates on the government agency 'Agmarknet', farmers are not getting the minimum support price for their crop. ""The Modi government's wrong policies are responsible for ignoring the farmers. How will their income double by 2022, when far from giving them 'cost + 50% profit', the farmer is not even getting the 'cost' of the crop,"" he said in a statement. He cited data available on 'Agmarknet' to say that farmers are not getting the minimum support price on Kharif crops. ""With this, the anti-farmer face of the Modi government has been exposed in front of everyone and it has been clearly proved that the promise of doubling the income of farmers by the year 2022 is just an election gimmick to mislead the country's Annadata and get their votes. It has nothing to do with the truth,"" Surjewala claimed. He also claimed that in the last 25 days, the market price received by the farmers of the country from their crops is much less than the minimum support price and the cost of crops. He said farmers across the country are agitating and opposition parties are also standing firmly in their support, but they are still facing ""injustice"". ""When the Modi government is deliberately reducing the purchase of crops at MSP as part of a conspiracy, then what is the benefit of fixing the MSP?"" ""Based on experience of the last seven years, it becomes clear that the Modi government believes less in work and more in making headlines. The truth is that under a well-thought-out conspiracy, the Modi government is continuously reducing the purchase of crops on MSP, so that gradually the MSP will end on its own,"" he alleged. If the government does not buy at the minimum support price, then the market price will fall and the farmer will be left with no option but to sell it below the cost, he said. ""This is happening now."" Resultantly, in the current year 2021-22, 118.93 lakh tonnes of less wheat was bought at MSP than last year 2020-21, he said. The Congress leader claimed that in 2019-20, 519.97 lakh tonnes of paddy was purchased at MSP, but in 2020-21, the Modi government bought only 481.41 lakh tonnes of money on MSP to weaken the MSP, which was 38.56 lakh tonnes less.

MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the COVID impact on the global economy, we're joined by Gita Gopinath, Chief Economist at the International Monetary Fund and the first woman to hold that role. Gita, good morning to you. IMF CHIEF ECONOMIST GITA GOPINATH: Hi, MARGARET. MARGARET BRENNAN: Let's start with a-- GOPINATH: --pleasure to join you. MARGARET BRENNAN: --I'm so glad you did. Let's start with the largest economy in the world, the United States. The IMF had said previously that any change in the size of this spending deal President Biden was putting together could have an impact on global growth. It's been shaved down from that original $4 trillion number. What will the impact be? GOPINATH: MARGARET, to answer that question, we will need to know what the ultimate package looks like because the original package, which was slightly over four trillion, the combined package of the infrastructure bill and then the human infrastructure bill, the two of them were about slightly over $4 trillion, but that had spending measures and it had revenue raising measures, including taxes. And now the question is what happens in this new package? Because if you're going to cut back spending and then you also then scale back tax increases, then the effect could be somewhat similar in terms of the net effect. But again, we won't know until we actually know the full details of the package. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we know at least that paid leave provisions are being trimmed from 12 weeks down to four. I know you have been looking at the impact specifically on women who are the caregivers here and are so central to the recovery. What does that do? GOPINATH: We've been in support of the paid parental leave, and we think 12 weeks is a reasonable time horizon and we'll wish to provide that kind of leave that would be consistent with the standards in other OECD countries. It's what the federal government currently has. And in this crisis, what we have seen is both what they call a she-cession and a mom-cession, which is the fact that we've had women being much harder hit in many parts of the world because they work in sectors- the contact intensive sectors that have been harder hit, but also because they end up being the main caregivers at home are the poor children of parents. And so therefore having this kind of paid family leave will help bring back women much more quicker into the workforce. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to pick up on that again on the other side of this commercial break, so please stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION, we want to continue our conversation with Gita Gopinath, chief economist at the International Monetary Fund. Before the break, you were talking about the rest of the world. The most developed economies in the world have 12 weeks of paid leave. The United States does not, and in fact, President Biden won't be able to deliver on that. His compromise has been four weeks of paid leave in the latest version of this spending bill. Is it safe to say that will have a negative impact on economic growth and your projections? GOPINATH: MARGARET, we need to bring back all the women who have left the labor force and return back to the market to get a full recovery and family paid leave absolutely helps in that dimension. Now, four weeks is better than zero, so I think that that is certainly progress made. But again, what we are seeing around the world is we are seeing labor markets that are recovering much more slowly than output and in the US, while we are seeing men come back much faster. Women are taking longer for that to happen. So we need to pay very close attention to making sure that women- its attractive for women to return to the workforce. MARGARET BRENNAN: And they're capable of it. So, the other thing I want to ask you about that's a big worry right now is just the cost of living. We're seeing prices go up. Procter & Gamble announced this week toothpaste, basic goods- they're going to have to raise prices there. The Federal Reserve chair in this country, Jerome Powell, said risks are to longer bottlenecks, higher inflation. How long can this go on before we lose control? GOPINATH: Inflation has indeed come up high in these last several months. Now some of that was expected after a deep recession last year. We've had a rebound in global demand. We've seen commodity prices come back up after crashing last year. But we're also now seeing the frictions between supply and demand not matching up. We're seeing supply chain disruptions around the world because the fact is that the grip of the pandemic remains, even though it may be somewhat lighter. It is- it remains in the world and that's creating disruptions everywhere. The way we see it is that these pressures will remain until sometime in the middle of next year. And then we should see- see us returning to more normal levels of inflation towards the end of next year. But this is going to take some time and we are certainly seeing costs go up. Energy prices have risen again sharply at this time of the year, and that's going to feed into headline inflation. MARGARET BRENNAN: There's also a potential debt crisis looming over the second largest economy in the world. A senior administration official here in the U.S. told me it could be catastrophic- it could just be painful- if one of the largest property developers there in China fails. How do you see this playing out? GOPINATH: The property sector is a very important part of China's economy, and Evergrande is one of the biggest property developers, which is why we're paying very close attention. But at the same time, our view is that the government has the resources and the ability to ring fence the problem, which means that while we will see a shake up happening in the real estate sector, that it will be contained and will not spill over more broadly to the China- to China's economy. And therefore we won't see very substantial slowing in growth, which is when we will see repercussions to the rest of the world. So it is a risk, is the downside risk that we're paying very close attention to, but we as of now, we believe that the effects can be contained. MARGARET BRENNAN: It's a controlled risk at this moment. GOPINATH: That's right. MARGARET BRENNAN: Alright. Gita Gopinath, thank you so much for joining us today. We'll be right back.

Senator Zed Seselja, fronting a Senate estimates hearing on Monday on Mr Taylor's behalf, said he could not comment on internal government deliberations. ""There is a long standing principle that documents for consideration of cabinet remain confidential,"" he said. ""What you're asking for is for this committee to be able to effectively interrogate the internal deliberations of cabinet and that has not been the approach in the past."" The majority of Nationals on Sunday ceded in-principle to a target of net-zero emissions by 2050. Concessions demanded by the junior coalition partner in exchange for its support have not yet been publicly announced as the deal is still being finalised. Senator Seselja said the plan would be based on policies Australia already had in place and would be detailed before the COP26 climate change summit starting in less than a week. The Senate hearing was told 125 countries had a mid-century net-zero target. Australia previously said it wanted to reach net zero as soon as possible and preferably by 2050.

Recycling… it doesn’t begin to address the problem.” He said “the only answer” was “we’ve all got to cut down on our use of plastic”.

They also demanded the constitution of an apex committee and a welfare board for the displaced people. The seven-member delegation, led by Jammu and Kashmir BJP spokesperson and former MLA G L Raina, met Shah at the Raj Bhawan here, officials said. The other members of the delegation included former Jammu and Kashmir chief secretary and Apni Party leader Vijay Bakaya, Youth All India Kashmiri Samaj (YAIKS) chief R K Bhat, All India Kashmiri Samaj (AIKS) leader A K Raina and Kashmiri Pandit Sabha (KPS) chief K K Khosa. They demanded security for the non-migrant Kashmiri Pandit employees in the valley, transfer of such employees from far-flung areas to nearby safe areas and a comprehensive insurance package for them. Nearly 3,000 Kashmiri Pandit employees recruited under the prime minister's special recruitment package have been appointed in the valley since 2010. The delegation also demanded security to temples, distress sale of land and the setting up of a welfare board for Kashmir Pandits, the officials said. It demanded the formation of an advisory council of Kashmiri Pandits to work under the minister of home affairs to come up with a plan for full restorative justice for the community. The delegation requested Shah to accept the community's demand for a single comprehensive rehabilitation plan, including employment and other rights, as enshrined in the Constitution, as well as restoration and rebuilding of temples, shrines and community assets, including crematoriums. Shah also met the wife and the brother of Deepak Chand, a teacher who was killed by terrorists in Srinagar recently.

The controversial idea of a bridge to the island, traditionally known as Minjerribah, came up again during the review, with mixed views among more than 760 community members consulted. Walking trails and a conservation zone are included in the revised plan for Cleveland’s Toondah Harbour. “Delivery of a bridge connection to Minjerribah is not currently being considered and is not in keeping with protecting and promoting the island’s unique and sensitive ecological and cultural features,” the Department of Transport and Main Roads said. While there are fewer cars on the island, the review heard public transport was still inefficient, costly and relied on passengers guessing when buses would arrive outside the three island towns. There was also poor co-ordination between the government, council and private transport operators responsible for the connecting ferries and buses. “Cash-only payments for Minjerribah bus services can result in long boarding times during busy periods, and potentially result in late-running services,” the department said. “In turn, this can result in delayed ferry departure times, due to the need to wait for passengers travelling to terminals by bus, or else result in passengers missing ferry services all together.” The review recommends the government’s smart-ticketing system be extended to North Stradbroke Island by mid-2022, with better integration into the mainland network. Ferries mostly depart from Toondah Harbour at Cleveland, where a proposed $1.3 billion redevelopment has been proposed as a gateway to North Stradbroke Island. The Australian government is now examining an updated version of the proposal, which has angered conservation groups because it would cover a section of internationally protected wetlands . A government spokesman said the developers had provided a revised draft environmental impact statement. If it “meets all necessary guidelines” the EIS will be published for another round of public consultation, the spokesman said. On the island side, the Queensland government has its own development proposals, releasing a master plan for Dunwich in the hope tourism revenue would help replace revenue lost when sand mining was banned. Sand mining generated between $62 million and $86 million each year in revenue to Queensland Treasury, Deloitte Access Economics estimated in April 2016. The government now wants to revamp old sand mining loading facilities on North Stradbroke Island to improve arrival and departure at the island. The former Riverside Sands facilities at Dunwich next to the ferry terminal will be revitalised into a larger, landscaped ferry terminal, concept drawings show. The state government has allocated $4.5 million for the new art gallery project for Dunwich on North Stradbroke Island. There would also be a new pedestrian connection from the Junner Street Ferry Terminal to the proposed QUAMPI art gallery, a revitalised cultural precinct and a proposed long-term car park in Dunwich’s main street. The government has made no mention of the much-publicised fast ferries between the Brisbane CBD and North Stradbroke Island in the master plan. John Sharpe, from the fast-ferry company River to Bay, said their business would offer more services as tourism facilities improved.",,smh

""This would be very, very positive to get it done before the trip,"" Mr. Biden said before departing Delaware for New Jersey, where he is pitching his domestic policy agenda and campaigning with Democratic Governor Phil Murphy, who's up for reelection in November. Democrats are working to reach consensus on a framework for Mr. Biden's domestic policy agenda, which will require support from Manchin and Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, both moderate senators who objected to the package's initial $3.5 trillion price tag. But there is daylight between Manchin and Democratic leaders over the topline number, as the West Virginia senator has said he supports a $1.5 trillion plan, while Mr. Biden set a price range for the legislation at roughly $2 trillion. In addition to trimming the social spending package, Democrats are also hashing out the details of how to pay for it , as the White House faced resistance from Sinema over its plan to raise the corporate tax rate and top income rate rate for the wealthiest Americans. U.S. President Joe Biden speaks at the Electric City Trolley Museum in Scranton, Pennsylvania, U.S., on Wednesday, Oct. 20, 2021. Biden, trying to drum up public support for his economic agenda in Scranton, met with the leader of the Congressional Progressive Caucus on Monday as lawmakers returned for make-or-break negotiations over the president's infrastructure and social spending proposals. Photographer: Hannah Beier/Bloomberg via Getty Images Bloomberg Mr. Biden's sweeping domestic policy package was initially set to include his plans for paid family leave, free community college, universal pre-K and to expand Medicare to include dental, vision and hearing. But at a town hall hosted by CNN on Thursday, the president said Manchin is opposed to Medicare expansion and free community college. Mr. Biden also said his plan for 12 weeks of paid family leave had been cut down to four weeks. The president, however, expressed optimism that Democrats in both chambers could reach an agreement on a framework for the package, one that would garner support from Manchin and Sinema. ""What we're trying to do is reach a point here where I'm able to present to the Senate — they're able to vote on — and the House a serious, serious piece of legislation that changes the dynamic for working-class folks in America and middle-class folks, and begins to have the very wealthy and corporations just begin to pay their fair share,"" he said Thursday. Democratic leaders are aiming to reach an agreement on the social spending plan before Mr. Biden's trip to Europe, during which he will attend the Group of 20 Leaders' Summit in Rome and United Nations climate summit in Glasgow. A deal on the details of the package would pave the way for the House to vote on a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill, which has already cleared the Senate, before the president leaves Washington, delivering him a key legislative win before he meets with world leaders. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday that Democrats have most of the social safety net bill ""agreed to and written."" The ""plan,"" she said, is for the House to vote on the physical infrastructure bill in the next week and Democrats to agree to a framework on the broader package. Alan He contributed to this report.

Facebook researchers saw how its algorithms led to misinformation,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-algorithm-news-feed-conservatives-liberals-india/,,,,Facebook researchers in 2019 created three dummy accounts to study the platform's technology for recommending content in the News Feed.,,2021-10-25 12:58:50,"Facebook researchers in 2019 created three dummy accounts to study the platform's technology for recommending content in the News Feed. The first was for a user in India, its biggest market. Then it created two more test accounts to represent a conservative American user and a liberal one. All three accounts engaged exclusively with content recommended by Facebook's algorithms. Within days, the liberal account, dubbed ""Karen Jones,"" started seeing ""Moscow Mitch"" memes, which referred to a nickname by critics of Republican Senator Mitch McConnell after he blocked bills to protect American elections from foreign interference. The conservative account, ""Carol Smith,"" was guided toward QAnon conspiracy theories. Meanwhile, the test user's News Feed in India was filled with inflammatory material containing violent and graphic images related to India's border skirmishes with Pakistan. The Facebook researcher running the Indian test user's account wrote in a report that year: ""I've seen more images of dead people in the past 3 weeks than I've seen in my entire life total,"" adding that, ""the graphic content was recommended by [Facebook] via recommended groups, pages, videos, and posts."" CBS News The internal Facebook memos analyzing the progression of these test accounts were part of thousands of pages of leaked documents provided to Congress by lawyers for Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen . A consortium of 17 U.S news organizations, including CBS News, has reviewed the redacted version of the documents received by Congress. The three projects illustrate how Facebook's algorithms for the News Feed can steer users to content that sow divisions. And they reveal that the company was aware its algorithms, which predict what posts users want to see and how likely they are to engage with it, can lead users ""down the path to conspiracy theories."" In a statement to CBS News, a Facebook spokesperson said the project involving the conservative test user is ""a perfect example of research the company does to improve our systems and helped inform our decision to remove QAnon from the platform."" In 2018, Facebook altered the algorithms that populate users' news feeds to focus on what it calls ""Meaningful Social Interactions"" in an attempt to increase engagement. But internal research found that engagement with posts ""doesn't necessarily mean that a user actually wants to see more of something."" ""A state[d] goal of the move toward meaningful social interactions was to increase well-being by connecting people. However, we know that many things that generate engagement on our platform leave users divided and depressed,"" a Facebook researcher wrote in a December 2019 report. CBS News The document, titled ""We are Responsible for Viral Content,"" noted that users had indicated the kind of content they wanted to see more of, but the company ignored those requests for ""business reasons."" According to the report, internal Facebook data showed that users are twice as likely to see content that is reshared by others as opposed to content from pages they choose to like and follow. Users who comment on posts to express their dissatisfaction are unaware that the algorithm interprets that as a meaningful engagement and serves them similar content in the future, the report said. There are several metrics that the News Feed algorithm considers, according to Facebook's internal documents. Each carries a different weight and content goes viral depending on how users interact with the post. When Facebook first moved toward meaningful social interactions in 2018, using the ""Like"" button awarded the post one point, according to one document. Signaling engagement using one of the reaction buttons with the emoticons that stand for ""Love,"" ""Care,"" ""Haha,"" ""Wow,"" ""Sad,"" and ""Angry"" were worth five points. A post that was reshared was also worth five points. Comments on posts, messages in Groups, and RSVPs to public events awarded the content 15 points. Comments, messages, and reshares that included photos, videos, and links were awarded 30 points. Facebook researchers quickly uncovered that bad actors were gaming the system. Users were ""posting ever more outrageous things to get comments and reactions that our algorithms interpret as signs we should let things go viral,"" according to a December 2019 memo by a Facebook researcher. CBS News In one internal memo from November 2019, a Facebook researcher noted that ""Angry,"" ""Haha,"" and ""Wow"" reactions are heavily tied to toxic and divisive content. ""We consistently find that shares, angrys, and hahas are much more frequent on civic low-quality news, civic misinfo, civic toxicity, health misinfo, and health antivax content,"" the Facebook researcher wrote. In April 2019, political parties in Europe complained to Facebook that the News Feed change was forcing them to post provocative content and take up extreme policy positions. One political party in Poland told Facebook that the platform's algorithm changes forced its social media team to shift from half positive posts and half negative posts to 80% negative and 20% positive. In a memo titled ""Political Party Response to '18 Algorithm Change,"" a Facebook staffer wrote that ""many parties, including those that have shifted strongly to the negative, worry about the long-term effects on democracy."" In a statement to CBS News, a Facebook spokesperson said, ""the goal of Meaningful Social Interactions ranking change is in the name: improve people's experience by prioritizing posts that inspire interactions, particularly conversations between family and friends."" The Facebook spokesperson also argued that the ranking change isn't ""the source of the world's divisions,"" adding that ""research shows certain partisan divisions in our society have been growing for many decades, long before platforms like Facebook ever existed."" Facebook said its researchers constantly run experiments to study and improve the algorithm's rankings, adding that thousands of metrics are considered before content is shown to users. Anna Stepanov, Facebook's head of app integrity, told CBS News the rankings powering the News Feed evolve based on new data from direct user surveys. The documents indicate that Facebook did change some of the rankings behind the News Feed algorithm after feedback from researchers. One internal memo from January of last year shows Facebook lowered the weight of ""Angry"" reactions from five points to 1.5. That was then lowered to zero in September of 2020. In February, Facebook announced that it is beginning tests to reduce the distribution of political content in the News Feed for a small percentage of users in the U.S. and Canada. The program was expanded earlier this month to include other countries.

Jean Chrétien says he never heard about abuse in residential schools while he was minister,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/jean-chr%C3%A9tien-tlmep-comments-1.6223637?cmp=rss,,['CBC News'],,"Former prime minister Jean Chrétien said Sunday that during his tenure as minister of what was then Indian Affairs, he never heard anything about abuse happening in residential schools.",,2021-10-25 12:42:15,"WARNING: This story contains details some readers may find distressing. Former prime minister Jean Chrétien said Sunday that during his tenure as minister of what was then Indian Affairs, he never heard anything about abuse happening in residential schools. Chrétien made the comments during an appearance on the popular Radio-Canada talk show, Tout le Monde en Parle . ""This problem was never mentioned when I was minister. Never,"" said Chrétien, now 87, of his time in the department from 1968 to 1974. During the French interview, Chrétien appeared to draw a comparison between his own experience attending a conventional college boarding school as a teenager to that of Indigenous children who were forced to attend residential schools. ""I ate baked beans and oatmeal. And to be sure, it was hard living in a boarding school, extremely hard. Here in Quebec, we had to [in order to get into university],"" he said. ""In Shawinigan, we didn't have a college. We had to go to Trois-Rivières or to Joliette,"" he explained. ""We had no choice. It was hard but my parents insisted I go to university and I had to do it."" Chrétien said while he didn't enjoy sleeping in a dorm with 200 others, he ""never had a problem."" Stories of physical and sexual abuse of Indigenous children in residential schools were documented in the 2015 Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Ottawa pledges $320 million to search for residential school graves and support survivors More recently, discoveries of unmarked graves on residential school sites have once again brought the issue to the forefront. Innu author critical of former PM's comments The former prime minister's comment drew the ire of another guest on the talk show, Innu author Michel Jean. ""Respectfully, I don't think Mr. Chrétien knows exactly what residential schools are,"" he said. ""The word boarding school makes people think it was a school where we teach people to write, but it wasn't that."" Innu author Michel Jean pushed back against the comments made by Jean Chrétien during the interview. (Radio-Canada) He said that while Chrétien might recall eating poor-quality food, it doesn't compare to what children in residential schools were subjected to. ""My mother's cousin told me that when there was duck, the nuns would keep the duck meat and cut the feet off, with its toenails still on, boil that in water, and that's what they gave to the kids."" Jean described how members of his own family suffered abuse in residential schools. ""There is someone in my family who attended a residential school in Fort George who was sexually assaulted every day for eight years by a nun,"" said Jean. ""It was called a boarding school, but it was not a school."" 'We can't rewrite history' Chrétien, who appeared on the talk show to discuss his new book, said that he was aware of the existence of residential schools, but not what was going on there. In Chrétien's autobiographical book, the former prime minister recounts an anecdote where he advised Queen Elizabeth not to apologize to the Maori people of New Zealand for the harm done to them by the British colonial administration. Chrétien writes in the book that he told her: ""Your Majesty, if you start [apologizing] I will have to bring you to Canada and, since we have several hundred Indigenous communities, you will be on your knees for at least two years."" When asked about this, Chrétien said it's fine to apologize, but ""we can't rewrite history. Terrible things happened."" Chrétien went on to defend his record, saying he tried to improve the lives of Indigenous people in Canada, both personally and politically. Quebec's residential school system started later than most in Canada — and also has history of abuse ""I even adopted an Indigenous son, to lead by example,"" he said. ""This proves my investment in this issue."" The last of the residential school sites in Canada closed in 1997, while Chrétien was prime minister.

The latest Newspoll, published in The Australian on Monday, found Labor is leading the coalition 54 per cent to 46 per cent on a two-party preferred basis. This compares to the last poll three weeks ago when Labor was leading 53 per cent to 47 per cent. Asked about the federal government's priorities, 47 per cent of voters polled nominated meeting targets to cut emissions while 40 per cent pointed to keeping energy prices down. When the same question on priorities was asked in February this year, the outcome was 43 per cent to 42 per cent, respectively. The poll, conducted between October 20-23, also found 35 per cent of voters believed a Labor government would be better at leading the response to climate change compared to 28 per cent for a coalition government. On the primary voting measure, support for the coalition was at 35 per cent compared to 38 per cent for Labor. This was the worst result for the government since December 9, 2018, according to the poll conducted by YouGov. But it also found Prime Minister Scott Morrison was considered the better leader at 48 per cent, compared to 34 per cent for Labor's Anthony Albanese.

Mr Boyce, currently an LNP politician in the Queensland Parliament, has vowed to campaign against the net zero policy, despite the party agreeing to support it. Callide MP Colin Boyce will openly campaign against the Coalition’s net zero target. Credit: Lydia Lynch Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Tuesday launched his government’s net zero plan, arguing Australia was on track to achieve an emissions cut of up to 35 per cent by 2030 , but that the policy would not put industries, regions or jobs at risk. Deputy Prime Minister and Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce was not present at Mr Morrison’s press conference, but Nationals MPs backed the goal at a tense meeting on Sunday, despite a core group objecting. However, the member for Callide, Mr Boyce – a boilermaker and farmer – said central Queensland was reliant on “heavily carbon intensive” industries such as coal mines, gas, aluminium and agriculture, and he questioned what net zero would mean for jobs. “What does that mean for the people that live and have jobs and earn their living by being associated to those industries?” he said. “What does zero net carbon emissions mean for economics? “Nobody has mapped that out, nobody has explained it adequately. “I think to sign up to something that has got no explanation to it is economically irresponsible.” Mr Boyce would not say whether he thought the Nationals had turned their back on Queensland’s resources industry, or whether he would cross the floor on any future legislation if elected. “Look, democracy has prevailed in the Nationals party room, they obviously had a great deal of discussion about it, and they’ve come to a decision. I just personally don’t agree with that,” he said. In August 2020, Mr Boyce crossed the floor of the Queensland Parliament to vote against mining rehabilitation laws that he believed were “absolutely toxic”. The LNP backbencher, who will vie for the central Queensland division of Flynn at the upcoming federal election, was endorsed in mid-2021 to replace retiring MP Ken O’Dowd. Mr O’Dowd retained Flynn, which covers the mining and beef areas of Gladstone, Rockhampton and Emerald, at the 2019 election with a more than 7 per cent swing in his favour. On election night in May 2019, Mr Morrison famously declared “How good’s Queensland?” as the Sunshine State helped return the Coalition to government amid a Labor bloodbath in the state. Seats in central Queensland closest to the Galilee Basin and the then-proposed Adani coal mine swung towards the Coalition on a two party preferred basis. Liberal Senator Arthur Sinodinos claimed former Greens politician Bob Brown’s anti-Adani convoy, which wound through central Queensland during the campaign, annoyed Queenslanders. However, the seat was tightly held on a margin of just 1 per cent before the last federal election. Mr Boyce would not be drawn on whether Queensland could deliver a swing in the reverse direction as a result of the Coalition’s decision to back the net zero target. “It remains to be seen how we advance toward the next federal election, which may be as late as May next year,” he said. “Obviously people will have to digest what has happened and its ramifications.” Queensland Senator Matt Canavan has also vowed to campaign against the policy, previously taking to Twitter to say he was “ deadset against net zero emissions ”.",,smh

Government tribunal paid some members in years they did no work,https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/government-tribunal-paid-some-members-in-years-they-did-no-work-20211024-p592le.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_politics,,['Katina Curtis'],,"The tribunal that reviews government decisions paid several of its part-time members in years they did no work, documents given to the Senate reveal.",,2021-10-24 18:00:00,"Several members of the tribunal that reviews government decisions were paid in years they did not work, documents reveal as the tribunal comes under renewed scrutiny from federal Parliament. Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) records show there were 15 part-time members who did no official business in at least one year between July 2018 and June 2021. AAT registrar Sian Leathem fought the publication of details about the workloads of the tribunal’s members. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen Five members received payment in at least one of those years when they did not work, documents given to a Senate estimates committee reveal. These were former Liberal senator Sue Boyce, Perth criminal lawyer Seamus Rafferty, occupational physician Michael Couch, Sydney lawyer Teresa Nicoletti, and former ACT Liberals leader Bill Stefaniak. However, this includes a period when some part-time members were paid a retainer for their availability. A spokeswoman for the AAT said the independent Remuneration Tribunal removed the minimum payment in 2019 and the final payment was made to eligible members in August that year. The tribunal also noted members may have received payments for work they did in the previous financial year. The AAT conducts independent reviews of administrative decisions made by government ministers, departments and agencies under Commonwealth laws. Dr Nicoletti said she had not received any payment in the past two financial years. She was appointed to the tribunal in 2006 but with the growing demands of running her legal practice, sought not to be reappointed in 2017. However, the AAT’s president persuaded her to stay on, she said, because the tribunal didn’t have other specialists in pharmaceutical patents. Since, very few pharmaceutical cases have come up and Dr Nicoletti doesn’t intend to seek reappointment when her term ends in 2022. She noted tribunal work could often be time-consuming because the AAT required members to take on cases outside their area of expertise. “Historically, I have done a lot of social security cases and also tax law cases, customs cases, where you are required to get across another area of law in order to be able to make a determination,” she said. The records also show five part-time members didn’t do any work for the AAT from 2018 to June 2021: Ms Boyce, Dr Couch, Mr Rafferty, Eric Knight, and barrister Andrew Tragardh. Although Mr Tragardh is named in the documents the AAT gave Parliament, he said he was never sworn in as a member, having declined the appointment due to ill health. Mr Rafferty and Mr Stefaniak’s appointments expired earlier this year, before the end of the 2020-21 financial year. The tribunal noted reasons for part-time members recording zero hours in a particular year could include them having said they wouldn’t be available due to personal or professional circumstances, or few or no cases being allocated. Labor senator Kim Carr has won an inquiry into appointments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen AAT registrar Sian Leathem had fought to keep the details of individual members’ workloads and cases secret. However, the tribunal produced the documents after the Senate’s legal and constitutional affairs committee unanimously rejected her reasons, which included concerns it could bring the AAT into disrepute. Senators are going to spend the next five months digging into the AAT and appointments to its ranks after Labor’s Kim Carr teamed with One Nation leader Pauline Hanson to push for a committee inquiry. Senator Carr has been a strong critic of the opaque appointment process. Over the past eight years, he says the government has appointed 79 former Liberal politicians, candidates, staffers and party members. “It is long past time for the Senate to put the tribunal under the microscope, along with other long-neglected aspects of Australia’s administrative review system,” he said. “Members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal are tasked with making life-changing decisions for tens of thousands of Australians each year, such as whether an older Australian receives an age pension, whether a veteran receives a service pension, whether a participant of the NDIS receives funding for essential supports or whether a refugee obtains a visa to remain in this country.” The Morning Edition newsletter is our guide to the day’s most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights.

Sooch said the hall has been booked for two upcoming gatherings for Diwali — one next Saturday and another two weeks later — and he’s hoping the business will start thriving again as more people return to socializing as usual. But Sooch said not everyone is ready for pre-pandemic-type parties while they still need to wear masks, especially seniors waiting for booster shots and families with children under 12 who can’t yet be vaccinated.

In a decision Friday, Justice Catherine Kane dismissed a legal challenge to the federal government from Toronto Right to Life, an anti-abortion group, as well as its former president and a student who’d hoped to work at the organization. The court case came after the Liberal government added wording to the Canada Summer Jobs program application in 2017 that required groups to say neither their core mandates nor the jobs being funded actively worked to undermine constitutional, human and reproductive rights.

Would rather talk to J-K's youth: Shah on NC chief seeking talks with Pak,https://www.business-standard.com/article/politics/would-rather-talk-to-j-k-s-youth-shah-on-nc-chief-seeking-talks-with-pak-121102500816_1.html,,,,Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Monday hit out at National Conference president Farooq Abdullah for seeking talks with Pakistan,,2021-10-25 10:32:00,"Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Monday hit out at National Conference president Farooq Abdullah for seeking talks with Pakistan, saying the government would rather talk to the youth of Jammu and Kashmir for making it the most developed in the country. The home minister, who is on a visit to Jammu and Kashmir -- his first since the abrogation of Article 370 in August 2019 -- remotely inaugurated several development projects and laid the foundation stone of some. ""I read in newspapers that Farooq Abdullah has suggested that the government should talk to Pakistan. He has a right to his opinion but we would rather talk to the Kashmiri youth,"" Shah said while addressing a function at the SKICC here. ""The repealing of Article 370 had only one intention -- to put Kashmir, Jammu and newly created Ladakh (Union Territory) on the path of development. You will see the fruits of our efforts by 2024,"" he said. The article, which granted special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, was abrogated in August 2019 and the state was bifurcated into union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. Shah inaugurated a 500-bed hospital at Bemina, completed at a cost of Rs 115 crore, laid the foundation stone for the Handwara Medical College, a Rs 46-crore steel girder bridge over the Ferozepur Nallah in Baramulla district and road projects worth Rs 4,000 crore, among others. The home minister, who is on his Jammu and Kashmir visit's third day, said that those who advocate talks with Islamabad and separatists should be asked what has Pakistan done in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). ""Compare the development between this side and PoK. Do they have electricity, roads, healthcare and toilets. There is nothing (on the other side). You (Kashmiris) have the same rights as any other Indian,"" he said. Without naming the Congress, the National Conference and the Peoples' Democratic Party, he said while only three medical colleges were set up by the ""three families which have ruled Jammu and Kashmir"", Prime Minister Narendra Modi has ensured seven new medical colleges and these are coming up. ""Earlier, 500 youths could become doctors ... now 2,000 youths can become doctors from these new medical colleges. Nobody will need to go to Pakistan to study medicine,"" he said. Shah said the schemes and the plans of the Modi government will ensure that Jammu and Kashmir will be the most developed province of the country. He sought the cooperation of the people to realise this dream. ""It is only the youth of Jammu and Kashmir who can work towards achieving this goal,"" he said. Asserting that the government is aiming to wipe out terrorism from Jammu and Kashmir and put an end to civilian killings, Shah said nobody would be allowed to disrupt peace and development in the Union Territory, which has a special place in Prime Minister Modi's heart. Defending the curbs on internet services and imposition of curfew in the aftermath of abrogation of Article 370, he said that ""some people would have misled the masses. Who would have been killed? The Kashmiri youth. We know how heavy the coffin of a young son is for an old man"". He said that 40,000 people have been killed in Kashmir in violence and it should stop now. ""This many people do not die even in wars. We have to come back and take Kashmir to new heights of development,"" he said. The minister said Rs 12,000 crore worth of investment has already come to the Union Territory and the government aims at a total of Rs 51,000 crore by the end of 2022 to provide five lakh jobs to the local youth. Shah said ""three families"" are answerable to the people for their failure to develop Jammu and Kashmir over the past seven decades. ""The new phase of development under the leadership of Modi has started in J&K but attempts are being made by inimical elements to create hurdles. I have come here to assure you that nobody will be able to create a hurdle and disrupt peace and development,"" Shah said. He said a new phase of development has started and this cannot be stopped by anyone. Listing various steps taken by the government since the formation of the BJP government at the Centre, Shah said five lakh jobs are being created in Jammu and Kashmir, while 20,000 people have been provided government jobs in the past two years. ""The three families used to say who will come and invest in J&K.... in just six months after announcing a new industrial policy, we have got an investment of Rs 7,000 crore in Jammu and Rs 6,000 crore in Kashmir and are looking forward to an investment of Rs 50,000 crore by the end of 2022, the minister said. Targeting the ""three families"", he said they were asking what the government is going to give to Jammu and Kashmir. ""We have a long list of what we have given to J&K and the people know it very well but the people are demanding an answer from them as to what they have given to J&K despite ruling the erstwhile state for the past seven decades. Have you thought of anyone else other than your own family members?"" Shah asked.

‘Draconian’: Government introduces new pandemic laws into Parliament,https://www.smh.com.au/politics/victoria/draconian-government-introduces-new-pandemic-laws-into-parliament-20211026-p593ci.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_politics,,['Sumeyya Ilanbey'],,"Health Minister Martin Foley said transparent decision-making was at the heart of the new legislation, but the Opposition decried it as an “incredible attack on democracy”.",,2021-10-26 08:00:10,"People found guilty of “intentionally and recklessly” breaching public health orders would face two years in jail or a $90,000 fine, the premier will get sweeping powers to declare pandemics and the public’s right to privacy will be enshrined in law under pandemic legislation introduced by the Andrews government. The opposition labelled the Public Health and Wellbeing Amendment (Pandemic Management) Bill 2021, which was tabled in Parliament on Tuesday, “draconian”, while civil liberty groups welcomed stronger safeguards on QR code check-in data. The new pandemic-specific laws, which will replace state-of-emergency powers when they expire on December 15, curtail the chief health officer’s powers, giving the premier authority to declare a pandemic and the health minister the role of making public health orders. Premier Daniel Andrews said the new legislation, which was informed by similar laws in other states and overseas, would provide a greater degree of transparency, accountability and oversight. “Ultimately [the bill goes further than], the NSW model, New Zealand model and even beyond that, with the scrutiny of acts and regulations committee having a role, there’s an independent advisory panel, there’s tailoring of advice, it all goes a step further than the robust framework right now,” Mr Andrews said. “It’s been a robust process, but we’re in a different phase now, we’re into opening up, living with the pandemic, living with the virus, therefore a broader set of considerations beyond just public health because we’re vaccinated at such high levels.” The premier will need to table a report in both houses of the Victorian Parliament setting out the reasons for declaring a pandemic, while the health minister and chief health officer will need to make their advice public. A pandemic can be initially declared for four weeks and renewed in three-month intervals thereafter until the disease no longer presents a risk to the community. An independent committee would scrutinise key decisions, but their advice and objections will not be binding. If a person failed to comply with a health order and knew – or ought to have known – it would lead to a “serious risk” to the health of others, they would face a jail sentence of two years or a $90,000 fine, while businesses could be fined $455,000. The legislation gives provision for the government to enforce public health orders to certain types of people, and take into account “their characteristics, attributes or circumstances”. Opposition Leader Matthew Guy argued the legislation would enable the government to discriminate against certain groups of people and shadow attorney-general Tim Smith described it as “terrifying”. Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton will no longer have authority to sign public health orders. Credit: Joe Armao However, Health Minister Martin Foley blasted the duo for “mischief-making”, and said the public health orders would be based on clinical grounds. He said it would give the government the authority, for example, to lock down a specific suburb, mandate vaccines to access large swaths of public life and impose density quotients or caps on events at which there are large numbers of unvaccinated young children. “[Race, religion, sexuality, gender] can’t be considered because the principles of the Public Health and Wellbeing Act don’t allow it to happen – it’s about public health and wellbeing, not your status of race or religion or gender,” Mr Foley said. “If anyone is suggesting that, they need to go back and do legislation interpretation 101. What it does reflect is some of the conspiratorial nonsense peddled by the opposition as they head increasingly to the margins of civic debate. Their contributions are increasingly hysterical and not informed by evidence.” Mr Guy labelled the new bill, which is expected to pass the lower house where the government has a majority on Wednesday, as an “incredible attack on democracy”, and called for greater parliamentary oversight. He accused the Premier of “usurping” the Parliament and cabinet process, and giving himself the authority to “rule by decree for months on end”. “This bill is the most extreme of its kind we’ve seen in Australia,” Mr Guy said. “While a pandemic requires different approaches, it doesn’t require a law as extreme as this.” Earlier this month, Mr Guy said public health orders should be “ticked off by a minister or the Premier”, but on Tuesday said the legislation went beyond giving elected officials the power to make decisions. Victorian Opposition Leader Matthew Guy said the new legislation was draconian. Credit: Joe Armao “That part of the discussion is but, what, 1 per cent of the government’s proposal. No one talked about imposing the ability of the Premier to shut down a protest or individuals on the basis of their characteristics,” Mr Guy said. “No one ever talked about the Premier having such extensive powers as proposed by this bill ... behind [this bill] the government have thrown a whole lot of other measures, which are completely and utterly draconian.” The Andrews government needs the votes of three independent MPs in the Legislative Council to pass legislation. It has already secured the votes of Fiona Patten, Andy Meddick and Samantha Ratnam – who they have been consulting with since March – all but guaranteeing the safe passage of the bill. However, Liberty Victoria president Julia Kretzenbacher said she did not support the bill being rushed through Parliament, and insisted that the new laws must be “carefully” scrutinised by MPs and the public. “Liberty Victoria is pleased that there will be protection of people’s personal and private data collected for public health reasons. We have always opposed that data being made easily available for policing or other reasons beyond public health,” Ms Kretzenbacher said. “It is good to see that there will be additional scrutiny of government decisions. Giving decision-making powers to the Premier and Health Minister will increase accountability, because, ultimately, Victorians will be able to express their approval or disapproval of those decisions at the ballot box.” Justice Party MP Stuart Grimley said apart from Ms Patten, Mr Meddick and Dr Ratnam, none of crossbench parliamentarians had yet seen the legislation. “Everything we’ve found out is through the media and that’s a disgrace because we all represent people,” Mr Grimley said. Health Minister Martin Foley refused to shed light on what would be considered an aggravated offence that attracts hefty penalties. Credit: Joe Armao “I’m really disappointed in this and it’s completely unnecessary. Members of Parliament still haven’t even been given the courtesy of a phone call and that’s really not good enough.” The debate on the legislation came as Victoria recorded 1510 coronavirus cases, and the deaths of four people on Tuesday. Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said he believed Victoria had passed the present peak, but warned cases would begin rising again as people moved around freely. “It will go up again.

Inflation data could reshape household finances,https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/inflation-data-could-reshape-household-finances-20211022-p592dp.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_politics,,['Shane Wright'],,Investors are betting the Reserve Bank will blink on its interest rate plan and an inflation report this week could prove pivotal to that bet.,,2021-10-24 18:00:00,"It may be the most important inflation report in a decade – and the finances of millions of Australian mortgage holders rest on what it reveals and how the Reserve Bank reacts. This week’s September quarter consumer price index will get closer than usual analysis due to concerns prices are being pushed up much more quickly than expected, forcing the RBA into the ultimate monetary policy reverse ferret. The official cash rate sits at 0.1 per cent, where it has been since November last year. The bank has fed out $188 billion in cheap cash to banks while it has bought $277 billion in government bonds to keep interest rates on these at rock-bottom levels. A quarter of a million people have become new homeowners since the pandemic. Their repayments could change depending on what this week’s inflation figures show. Credit: Paul Jeffers Its aim has been to support the economy through the deepest downturn since the 1930s. But 22 months after the world first heard about the coronavirus, the recovery out of recession has been much faster and stronger than anyone – including the RBA – had expected. That strength in recovery has been layered atop supply bottlenecks that have resulted in huge queues of container ships outside major ports, a shortage of workers in almost every country touched by COVID and, now, inflation. The bank’s stated aim is to hold inflation between 2 and 3 per cent. It’s a task that even the bank’s recent annual report conceded it had failed to achieve for more than five years. During the depths of COVID, inflation in Australia turned negative. Now it is increasing and the question being debated is whether the factors driving up prices are either transitory or embedded in the economy. Last week, inflation in New Zealand hit 4.9 per cent. A year ago, it was 1.4 per cent. The NZ central bank this month lifted its official interest rate to 0.5 per cent. Inflation has picked up everywhere – it’s at 5.4 per cent in the United States, 4.4 per cent in Canada and 4.1 per cent in Germany. Financial markets in Australia believe these overseas examples are an insight into what will happen here. Investors are punting the official cash rate climbing above 0.5 per cent by the end of next year. The RBA, which famously signalled a lift in interest rates in 2018 before being forced to cut them in 2019, is staring down markets. Its stated position is interest rates won’t move until inflation is “sustainably” within 2 to 3 per cent, with wages likely growing at better than 3 per cent. On its forecasts, that doesn’t happen until 2024. RBA governor Philip Lowe on Friday told an international audience that the bank’s focus was on the medium to long term, telling markets not to jump at every inflation shadow. “While financial markets are often concerned about whether inflation in a given year is 1.7 or 2.3 per cent, most people in the real economy rightly don’t focus too much on this,” he said. “What matters for overall welfare is that people are confident that their savings and their income will not be eaten away by inflation. It is also important that saving and investment decisions can be made without inflation figuring prominently on people’s radar screens.” The issue is vital to a nation that has some of the most heavily indebted households in the developed world. Since the RBA started cutting official rates to deal with the pandemic in March last year, more than 250,000 first time home buyers have taken on a mortgage. Not only have they benefited from record-low interest rates, they have also taken advantage of huge government handouts that in some parts of the country approached $90,000 in value. All banks test the ability of borrowers to absorb higher interest rates. It’s clear that at the moment, people could easily cover that extra cost. But it’s been more than a decade since homebuyers have had to cover that extra cost. They haven’t had to reduce expenditure to cover the monthly mortgage. A half percentage point increase in interest rates is, historically, relatively small beer. However, average mortgages are now at record levels. The average mortgage for an established house in NSW last month reached $750,000. A half percentage point lift on that sized mortgage equates to almost $200 a month in extra repayments. A person earning $90,000 a year pays about 19,700 in income tax. To not feel the increase in interest rates on their $750,000 mortgage, they would need their pay to reach $93,500. That’s a pay increase of 3.9 per cent. The last time wages were growing that fast was in 2011. In other words, people will have to eat into their savings or reduce their spending to offset the full impact of such a rate rise. The average mortgage for an established house in NSW last month reached $750,000. This is one of the reasons why the RBA has been at pains to talk about wages growth – and the lack of it – as a key factor in its thinking about inflation and interest rates. While investors are betting on rate rises, few economists believe interest rates will be rising before the second half of next year. And even then, it will be only one increase, rather than two. UBS analysts Giulia Specchia and George Tharenou said the global economy’s rebound out of the COVID recession had been faster than any time in history. That meant investors were betting on a much faster-than-expected move back to “normal” monetary policy settings. RBA governor Philip Lowe has said the bank is unlikely to lift interest rates until 2024. Credit: Dominic Lorrimer They believe the RBA, rather than increasing rates, will move more quickly to wind back its quantitative easing program which will pump $4 billion a week into the financial system until February next year. ANZ senior economists David Plank and Adelaide Timbrell said financial markets being bullish on interest rate movements was not new. Markets have repeatedly priced in a rate rise or two over the past decade. Rates last increased in 2010. They said Dr Lowe’s commentary over recent weeks has been clear that the main game remains wages although a surprise in this week’s inflation result could force a re-think. “Even if we get an upward surprise to inflation in the upcoming September quarter data there may be less impact on the RBA’s medium-term forecast if its view on wages is unchanged. But the make-up of the CPI data will be important,” they said. NAB analysts led by its well-respected chief economist Alan Oster are even more sceptical of an interest rate increase. “In the near-term, measured inflation is likely to be buffeted by supply-side disruptions as well as by government subsidies,” they said. “We expected these impacts to be largely transitory and a clean read on inflation pressures may not occur until mid-to-late 2022.” By Wednesday afternoon, the RBA, financial markets and mortgage holders should have a better idea of what’s in store.

EXPLAINED: What are the Facebook Papers? Haugen has testified before American and British regulators about how she says Facebook prioritizes profits over safety. She had said the company hides research assessing what role it plays in inciting political violence, and the records have prompted serious concerns about the extent to which its products hurt teenage users, particularly girls.

The health department confirmed on Tuesday the state is managing 24,715 active cases. There are 817 people in hospital, 15 more than the previous day, with the seven-day average at 789. Of those, 147 are in intensive care and 88 on a ventilator. The latest deaths take the toll from the current outbreak to 234. There were 55,679 tests processed and 28,232 COVID-19 vaccine doses administered at state-run hubs on Monday. About 75 per cent of Victorians aged 16 and over are now fully vaccinated. The latest figures come as the state government is set to introduce new laws to parliament that would allow the health minister to make public health orders for the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the changes, Victoria's premier will have the power to ""declare"" a pandemic and extend it in three-month blocks for as long as considered necessary. The Public Health and Wellbeing (Pandemic Management) Bill 2021 will be introduced to the lower house as parliament resumes on Tuesday, several MPs have confirmed to AAP. Under the laws, the health minister will be provided ""broad powers to make pandemic orders"" on the chief health officer's advice, bringing Victoria in line with NSW and New Zealand where the health minister is directly accountable to parliament. An independent oversight committee will review public orders and their impact on human rights, while public health advice will need to be made public. The laws also introduce safeguards around protecting contact tracing and QR code information, while an aggravated offence will be created to ""deter ... the most egregious pandemic-related behaviours"". Court-imposed penalties will be introduced to stop businesses receiving commercial benefit after breaching a pandemic order. The bill aims to improve transparency in pandemic decision-making, with decision-makers to be accountable to parliament and the community, its summary said. It will replace the current state of emergency, which expires on December 15. The government has consulted with community groups, health and human rights experts and legal stakeholders on the proposed laws, and the bill is expected to pass the lower house but in the upper house it will require the backing of three of the 11 crossbenchers. Victoria's opposition said the new powers would give the premier ""more power with less accountability"", as it proposed the constitution be amended to require parliamentary approval for emergency or pandemic declarations. Tuesday's sitting is also the first since a vaccine mandate came into effect banning MPs from parliament if they refuse to provide proof of their vaccination status.

He said this at the opening of a two-day training for journalists on Peace and Conflict-Sensitive Reporting jointly organised by the NGF and Premium Times in Abuja. According to him, some of the news headlines sometimes threatened the very fabrics that keep the country together. The NGF DG said the training was in respond to the new dynamics, which have again brought the media to the fore in the types of reporting that would either keep the country together or drive us all apart. Okauru explained that the NGF as a platform for all the 36 State Governors believes in the fundamental and the inalienable importance of freedom of speech and would continue to partner with the media not just to keep the country together, but to ensure that media practitioners that associate with body are trained and retrained to live up to the responsibility that this noble profession has bestowed on all of you. He said “As far as I know, most of you here by experience and training are among the best hands in the business. Most of you cover sensitive beats because you are trusted by your media organisation. This beat is just one of the sensitive ones, and for us, bringing you up to speed on modern techniques of your trade and its trends of reporting is not negotiable. “At the NGF Secretariat, we are convinced that no nation develops without a responsible media.

What a pediatrician says about the COVID vaccine for kids,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-vaccine-kids-pediatrician-questions-answers/,,,,"Former acting CDC Director Dr. Richard Besser, pediatrician and President of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, weighs in on new guidelines for 5-11 year olds.",,2021-10-25 16:16:51,"Children aged 5 to 11 will soon be able to get a COVID-19 vaccine at their pediatrician's office, local pharmacy and potentially even their school, the White House announced on Wednesday as it detailed plans for the expected authorization of the Pfizer shot for younger children in a matter of weeks. Federal regulators will meet over the next two weeks to weigh the benefits of giving shots to kids, after lengthy studies meant to ensure the safety of the vaccines. So what does this mean for families and the fight against COVID-19 ? Here's what Dr. Richard Besser, former acting CDC director and president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, told ""Face the Nation."" The White House has announced plans to distribute vaccines for 5-11 year olds. As a pediatrician, how soon can parents expect to have their kids vaccinated? If the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorizes the use of this vaccine in children and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends it, vaccines could be available by early November. As both a pediatrician and a parent, I'm looking forward to having a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine for young children. While we can all be grateful that they are at less risk of severe disease, the impact of the pandemic on children has been profound. • More than 6 million children in the U.S. have gotten COVID-19, including more than 1.1 million in the last six weeks alone. • More than 600 children have died from COVID-19, 158 of whom have been between the ages of 5 and 11. • More than 5,000 children have gotten a severe multisystem inflammatory condition known as MIS-C following a COVID-19 diagnosis, which can have debilitating physical effects. Children who haven't gotten COVID-19 directly have still been hit hard by this virus. More than 140,000 children have lost a parent or caregiver, while long-term school closures and lockdowns have negatively affected children's social, emotional, and mental health. Across the board, children of color and those from low-income families have suffered disproportionately from COVID-19. Fortunately, we're moving closer to a vaccine for younger children. Here's how it works: On October 26th, the FDA's independent advisory committee on vaccines, known as VRBPAC, will meet to decide whether to recommend a vaccine for kids in this age group. If the FDA ultimately authorizes that vaccine, the CDC's independent advisory committee, known as ACIP, is scheduled to meet on November 2nd and 3rd to make recommendations on who should get it; the CDC director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, would then need to announce her official recommendations before any vaccines for children are administered. If that timeline holds, and both the FDA and CDC give the green light, we would probably see the first shots going in kids' arms within days of the CDC's official recommendation being announced. It is critically important from both a health and trust standpoint that we allow this process to play out rather than simply assuming the vaccine will be authorized. The FDA, the CDC, and their respective independent agencies must undertake a thorough and independent review to determine whether the vaccine is safe and effective for children in this age group. The data that have been released to date are promising, but independent scientific review must guide this process. The Biden administration is planning to push vaccines out through many channels including doctors offices, local pharmacies, and schools. They aren't planning on doing mass vaccination clinics like we saw for adults. Will this do enough to ensure vaccines go to the most vulnerable or needy of school aged children? I'm excited about the approach that is being taken. The Biden administration has announced that it has purchased enough vaccines for the 28 million children in the U.S. who are in the 5-11 age group. They are working with states and localities to plan for vaccines to be distributed to all communities. It makes a lot of sense to provide shots in settings where children are used to being vaccinated, such as their doctor's offices where trust levels are high. As a pediatrician, I am used to vaccinating children and answering questions from caregivers every single time I'm in the clinic. But we also know that many children do not have health insurance or their own healthcare provider: the latest figures show that 5.6% of children were uninsured in 2020, but the uninsured rate is nearly twice as high for children in poverty. That's why vaccination clinics at other places, such as hospitals, pharmacies, health centers, and schools, are all essential to reach children in all neighborhoods. Moreover, it is critical that public health officials collect data on race, ethnicity, and neighborhood so that any disparities in vaccine uptake can be documented and addressed. We also need to make it as easy as possible for parents to get their children vaccinated and stay home with them if side effects keep some kids out of school for a day. Unfortunately, in the United States, people's access to paid leave benefits largely depends on their job and income level. We are the only wealthy nation that does not guarantee any paid leave for new parents or to care for a sick family member. Black, Latino and Indigenous people are much more likely to work in minimum wage jobs that don't provide paid leave. Emergency legislation passed by Congress has incentivized more employers to offer paid leave benefits, including time off for vaccination, but temporary tax credits for that purpose have expired and approximately 100 million workers remain without any paid leave at all. The idea that any parent would have to choose between earning a paycheck and getting their children a potentially life-saving vaccine is just wrong. It is well past time for the United States to establish a national paid leave program that covers all workers while taking meaningful steps to ensure working families have quality and affordable child care options. What would you tell parents who are still unsure about the COVID-19 vaccine? It is understandable that parents would have questions and concerns about any new vaccine. Polling shows that parents are split on COVID-19 vaccines for children: some plan to get their children vaccinated right away; some have no intention of doing so at all; and some prefer to take a ""wait and see"" approach. We have seen these divergent viewpoints play out with vaccines for both adults and adolescents, so it is not a surprise to see it with younger children as well, especially since the clinical trials for children at this age level were far smaller than those conducted for adults. As a pediatrician, I've spent many hours counseling parents on vaccines for children. Just a few days ago, in the clinic where I still see patients, I talked with a mother about vaccines for her teenage sons. She wants to see more data before she makes her decision. We had an open and respectful conversation. In my experience, pressuring and berating people doesn't work. The first step is to listen; it's important that we give people the time and space to ask questions and have their concerns heard. Parents should bring those questions or concerns to a healthcare provider or others they trust to get accurate information. Vaccine misinformation is rampant and its continued spread ultimately disrespects and endangers those who may have legitimate questions for which they're seeking honest answers. The approach that is being planned for administering COVID-19 vaccines to younger children will make it easier for these conversations to happen. While kids are at a lower risk of COVID complications, how should parents of young children, infants and up to 5 years old, approach the virus? While it is cause for optimism that caseloads have dropped significantly in recent weeks, they remain extremely high, and the U.S. is still averaging approximately 1,500 deaths per day. I don't believe we will truly get a handle on this pandemic unless and until safe and effective vaccines are available for all age groups and until more adults decide to get vaccinated. It's important to remember that even if vaccines are authorized for children ages 5-11, children under age 5 still won't be vaccine-eligible, and they are likely to remain ineligible until early 2022 at the earliest. One of those most important steps we can take to protect children ineligible for vaccination is to ensure that the adults around them are fully vaccinated. There are currently about 66 million vaccine-eligible people in the United States who remain unvaccinated. In places where vaccination rates are particularly low, those communities remain especially susceptible to additional cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. Achieving a higher vaccination rate across the board is the most important step we can take to save lives. There are other steps we can take to keep our youngest children safe. The CDC recommends that everyone age 2 and up in schools and child care facilities wear masks. That's an essential component of keeping kids, teachers, and staff safe, and increasing the chances that these facilities will be able to operate safely and stay open. The CDC also recommends that everybody ages six months and up gets a flu shot. That is incredibly important. In a typical flu season, thousands of young children are hospitalized from the flu, and we're already starting to see some respiratory viruses circulate earlier than usual this year with kids back in schools and child care facilities. Flu shots save lives and ease the strain on hospitals and other healthcare providers. Do you envision a future of a COVID vaccine or booster being part of routine childhood immunizations like the polio vaccine any time soon? Vaccines have been a part of my professional career for decades. There is nothing I do as a pediatrician that has more proven health value than working to ensure that all of my patients are fully vaccinated on time. Every state requires vaccinations for children to attend school. Vaccination rates for required immunizations, such as measles, mumps, and rubella, tend to be extremely high. We have seen a growing number of vaccine mandates in workplace settings across the country, which I think is the right move. We're even seeing this among younger populations; some schools already require COVID-19 vaccines for certain older children, such as high school student-athletes. While all three COVID-19 vaccines available in the U.S. are extremely effective at preventing severe disease, hospitalization, and deaths, only Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine has been granted full approval by the FDA to date, and only for those ages 16 and up. Over time, as the evidence base around vaccine efficacy and safety continues to build, we may see more full approvals granted by the FDA, and for younger age groups. Additional full approvals may well lead COVID-19 vaccines to eventually being recommended as part of the CDC's routine childhood immunization schedule, and would likely lead to greater numbers of states and localities adopting COVID-19 vaccine requirements.

Research by the Australia Institute found truth in political advertising laws are strongly supported by voters across the political spectrum. Thirty nine prominent Australians have also signed an open letter calling for the parliament to pass such laws. It coincides with independent MP Zali Steggall's introduction of a truth in political advertising bill into the House of Representatives. The signatories include Nobel Laureate Peter Doherty, former political party leaders Carmen Lawrence, John Hewson and Cheryl Kernot, and retired judges David Harper and Anthony Whealy. ""Any genuine attempt to clean up our politics must begin with a commitment to truth telling,"" Dr Hewson, a former Liberal leader, said. ""Truth in campaign ads is an important beginning."" Ms Kernot, the former Democrats leader, agreed. ""It remains absolutely unacceptable that an election's outcome can be decided by deliberately deceptive political advertising,"" she said. Senior researcher at the Australia Institute Bill Browne said the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for politicians to be honest and transparent, and the serious consequences of public distrust and disengagement. ""Last year, the ACT passed truth in political advertising laws unanimously, with Labor, Liberal and Greens politicians working together,"" Mr Browne said.

Paris has set midnight on Friday as the deadline and is preparing reprisals, which may be triggered next Monday. It wants to slap extra import taxes on British goods but is unlikely to win the necessary backing from the EU. Instead, it could cause backlogs at Calais and Dover by ordering more physical checks. Other measures will include hiking electricity in Jersey and blocking UK boats from French ports.

The policy will come with updated projections that show Australia will surpass its stated goal of reducing emissions by 26 to 28 per cent by 2030, factoring in the new measures to claim the cuts could reach as much as 36 per cent. Prime Minister Scott Morrison (right) and his deputy Barnaby Joyce in Question Time on Monday. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen Prime Minister Scott Morrison is expected to outline the changes alongside Energy Minister Angus Taylor along with policies on fuel standards, electric vehicles, the use of hydrogen as a “clean” fuel and more spending of taxpayer funds on energy projects. Labor leader Anthony Albanese called on Mr Morrison to reveal the plan after telling Parliament on Monday he welcomed the government’s move to adopt the 2050 target Labor had taken to the last federal election. Mr Morrison told question time the government would “exceed expectations” on the 2030 target it took to the last election, ahead of a federal cabinet decision on Monday night that was expected to sign off on the energy policy. “It is performance that counts, not empty aspirations, and what Australia can point to is a track record of delivering a 20 per cent reduction in emissions at the same time as Australia has achieved 40 per cent increase in the size of our economy.” When Mr Morrison spoke of the government’s plan to cut emissions, Mr Albanese asked him to produce the document and the Prime Minister replied that it would be revealed “soon enough” and the government would be “absolutely transparent” about the details and modelling. Mr Albanese dismissed that as a “joke” in a series of interjections about the long wait for the government to produce the policy while it negotiated with the Nationals. “You’ve been in government for nine years,” the Labor leader said across the House of Representatives. Nationals leader and Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce secured an immediate win for his party in return for its support for the net zero goal , with Resources Minister Keith Pitt returning to federal cabinet on Monday. Credit: Illustration: Matt Golding A key aim in the appointment is for the Nationals to have a senior minister who is across the detail of the climate policy to make sure the party secures the safeguards it is being promised to prevent climate measures hurting regional communities. The Nationals are confident of gaining changes to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation to ease what they see as “green tape” on farmers and miners, sparking a likely fight in Parliament over the scale of the changes when Labor and the Greens want stronger checks on new projects. More infrastructure spending will also be part of the final package, including support for an extension of the inland rail project being built from Melbourne to Brisbane. But the concessions to the Nationals are expected to take time to be delivered and some will not be confirmed until the mid-year budget update in December, the federal budget next year and possibly the federal election campaign. Mr Pitt first rose to cabinet when one of Mr Joyce’s closest colleagues, Matt Canavan, quit the frontbench out of frustration with former leader Michael McCormack. He was dumped from cabinet when Mr Joyce returned to the Nationals’ leadership in June and promoted one of his supporters, Andrew Gee, to the senior rank. While the move gives the Nationals an additional seat in the inner circle of government, Liberal MPs appeared to accept the outcome as the “cost of doing business” when the important goal was government unity and a settlement on climate policy. With both major parties promising a net zero target for 2050, the political debate in Parliament centred on Mr Morrison’s claim to exceed the government’s 2030 target while Labor is yet to decide whether it will set a new goal for that year. Mr Taylor said the new measures would reflect his approach of using “technology not taxes” to reduce emissions, but the policy package is expected to include substantial spending of taxpayer funds, incurring debt when the government is forecasting budget deficits to continue beyond 2030.

2020 saw the highest number of reported hate crimes in two decades,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hate-crimes-report-2020-fbi-highest/,,,,The original data published in August had a technical error that inadvertently excluded some data from Ohio,,2021-10-25 16:31:02,"The number of hate crimes reported in 2020 was the highest recorded in two decades, according to updated FBI data released Monday. The FBI revealed its amended hate crime statistics for fiscal year 2020 following a technical submission error that had excluded some data from Ohio in the agency's original release in August. The FBI has since addressed the technical challenge in the state's reporting system. Law enforcement agencies submitted reports for 8,263 criminal incidents and 11,129 related offenses motivated by biases toward race, ethnicity, ancestry, religion, sexual orientation, disability, gender, and gender identity. The updated release reflects an increase in more than 500 hate crime incidents with the inclusion of the new data. The total number of criminal incidents represents an 11% increase from 2019 and the highest number of hate crime incidents recorded since 2001, a year that documented 9,730 incidents and a sharp rise in hate crimes directed toward perceived Muslim Americans in the wake of the September 11 attacks. In 2020, updated data shows that 8,052 crimes motivated by one kind of bias, deemed single-bias incidents, took place and involved 11,126 victims. In 2019, the FBI recorded 7,103 single-bias incidents involving 8,552 victims total. In total, nearly 62% of hate crimes were tied to an individual's race nationwide, according to the FBI. As in past years, Black Americans made up the largest share of individuals targeted because of their race or ethnicity, while Jewish Americans represented the group most frequently targeted over religious bias. But last year, individuals of Asian descent saw a 76% increase in hate crimes, fueled in part by racist stereotypes linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, 279 anti-Asian hate crime incidents were reported, compared to 158 in 2019. Following rare, bipartisan support by Congress, President Biden signed ""the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act"" in May to address the uptick in violence, particularly against Asian Americans. The legislation directed the Department of Justice to designate a point person to expedite the review of hate crimes related to COVID-19, authorized state and local grants for hate crime-reduction programs and boosted public reporting resources in multiple languages online. Since then, Attorney General Merrick Garland has named Rachel Rossi to be the department's hate-crimes coordinator, and directed Jim Felte, head of the department's civil rights division's criminal section, to oversee an expedited federal review of hate crimes. According to Garland, the Justice Department has charged more than 17 defendants with federal hate crimes over the past six months, including three men indicted following the death of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man who was shot while jogging, last year. ""Though the Justice Department's work to address unlawful acts of hate has a deep history, it remains an immediate and pressing charge that constantly requires new thinking,"" the attorney general said Monday, during a virtual conference centered on combating hate. In its latest release, the FBI also indicated 20% of the hate crimes targeted an individual's sexual orientation while 13% targeted their religion. More than half of all offenders were White. Of the 7,426 hate crime offenses reported and classified as crimes in 2020, more than half of those witnessed were for intimidation, while nearly 18% represented simple assault, and 18% were aggravated assault. In total, 22 murders and 19 rapes were recorded as hate crimes by the FBI."" But incomplete participation has long plagued the FBI's hate crime program, which remains voluntary for the more than 18,000 law enforcement agencies, nationwide. The bureau is offering nationwide incentives like grants and more training and to help improve participation in its annual hate crime survey. ""I think the picture we have is limited based on participation and the data we received. I'm certainly aware of the number of agencies that haven't participated,"" Assistant Director of the FBI's Criminal Justice Information Services Division Michael Christman told CBS News, last month. The FBI said 15,138 law enforcement agencies submitted hate crime data to the bureau. But Christman suggested that even among those who submit data, some may not be providing complete reporting of hate crimes. ""I'm aware of the number of agencies that have submitted zero incidents again and again,"" Christman continued. ""It is certainly a priority for us to develop innovative and creative ways to really get better at obtaining this data so that we can have a full picture of hate crimes in the United States, and certainly accountability and transparency. And I think better policing will be the result.""

Alberta minister tables bill that would outline criteria for infrastructure funding decisions,https://edmontonjournal.com/news/politics/alberta-bill-73-infrastructure,,['Lisa Johnson'],,,,2021-10-25 21:13:29,"Article content Alberta Infrastructure Minister Prasad Panda introduced a bill Monday that aims to take local politics out of provincial infrastructure funding decisions. Article content If passed, Bill 73, the Infrastructure Accountability Act, will put into law six criteria that would decide which capital projects, like schools and hospitals, get to the top of the government’s funding list. We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser, or tap here to see other videos from our team . Alberta minister tables bill that would outline criteria for infrastructure funding decisions Back to video Panda told Postmedia in an interview the bill would help remove political bias from the decision-making process. “It’s not just about transparency, accountability and predictability, it’s also about de-politicizing,” said Panda. It comes out of a UCP campaign promise to bring more transparency to capital project decisions. The six criteria will look at how any request put before the government will “address health, safety and compliance needs, align with government priorities and strategies, foster economic activity and create jobs, improve program delivery and services, consider life-cycle costs and whether it will generate a return on investment,” and “enhance the resiliency of communities.” Article content Panda said that doesn’t mean that every capital project needs to align with all six, for example, the “return on investment” requirement would not apply to projects like schools and hospitals, only things like irrigation and transportation projects in terms of local economic impact. The act also demands the development and regular review of a 20-year strategic capital plan. If it passes, that long-term plan must be publicly released within one year of the bill coming into force. Typically, budget plans project capital spending priorities over four years. When asked how the bill would avoid situations in which local municipal priorities don’t align with the provincial government criteria, Panda said the government’s major consideration is overall economic and social impacts, adding he’s confident municipalities support the changes, even though there is “always political disagreement.” “I’ll be fooling myself if I think that everybody could support (that framework) 100 per cent, but the majority of them are confident,” he said. The bill would respond to some recommendations made by the MacKinnon panel’s report to legislate rules for capital planning, and public release long-term 20-year capital plans. In its news release, the government said between June and August 2020, it received 3,172 total survey submissions and 56 written submissions from Albertans, with many in support of the bill.

Details of the plan, and regional support measures won by the Nationals, will be revealed by Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Tuesday. Resources Minister Keith Pitt was elevated back into cabinet, just months after he was demoted after Barnaby Joyce regained the Nationals leadership in June. Nationals deputy leader David Littleproud told the ABC the plan would be released on Tuesday. ""We will be honest with the Australian people about this rather than just sign up blindly,"" he said. ""That's what is important. That's what people want out of politicians and that's what we'll do (on Tuesday)."" Cabinet was due to meet on Monday night to finalise the details. Mr Pitt, an outspoken critic of climate targets and proponent of coal and gas, was targeted in question time by the opposition about his stance on net-zero and whether he supported the Nationals agreement. ""(Labor) are all about digging up dirt but not in the way the resources sector does it,"" he said. In a statement after his reappointment to cabinet, Mr Pitt said he was committed to regional communities. The prime minister said Australia was on track to meet and beat emission reductions targets. ""What Australia can point to is a track record of delivering a 20 per cent reduction in emissions at the same time as Australia has achieved a 40 per cent increase in the size of our economy,"" he said. ""I'd like to see another country match that."" Despite reports Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce told Sunday's party room meeting he did not back the net-zero, he told parliament he supported the 2050 target. Nationals MP Darren Chester, who supported the deal, said he hoped division over climate within the coalition would end following the net-zero agreement. ""There are extremities on the left and the right, but most Australians are somewhere about the sensible centre when it comes to this issue,"" Mr Chester said. ""It's almost impossible to imagine that 21 people coming from all around Australia agree on every issue."" Labor's climate change spokesman Chris Bowen said the government had been dragged ""kicking and screaming"" on a deal for net-zero. ""If Keith Pitt is returning to the cabinet as part of this deal, it tells the lie,"" he said. ""It's not about jobs in the regions - it's about one job for one member of the National Party. It's all about them, not about the people they are meant to represent."" The prime minister said the government would not support a plan for net-zero emissions unless there was a plan to achieve it. ""The people in rural Australia deserve that, they deserve to know what the plan is and how we're going to achieve it,"" he said. The government has so far refused to release the modelling for its 2050 target.

Scott Morrison announced the government’s policy to reach net zero emissions on Tuesday. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen The government expects to generate between $60 billion and $100 billion in private spending from its $20 billion technology investment, and has flagged it could commit billions more in future budgets. However, significant questions surround the ability of the shortlisted technologies to be cost-competitive at scale. The government’s policy released on Tuesday sets out “stretch goals” to benchmark how much cheaper zero-emissions fuels such as clean hydrogen must become before they are cost-competitive with existing fuel sources for vehicles, power generation and a range of industrial processes. At today’s prices, “green hydrogen” – produced when a renewable energy-powered electrolyser is used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen – costs four times more than fossil fuel-based hydrogen. “One of the safest assumptions that you can make is the rapid introduction of technology will continue to drive these costs down”, Mr Morrison said. Technology had “revolutionised the economy globally” and further advances were a “given”, he said. Australian National University Professor Warwick McKibbin said a tax on carbon pollution was still the most economically efficient way to reduce emissions in private industry. “It’s not all about technology,” he said. “Technology is part of the answer but really if you don’t change the price of carbon-intensive products relative to other products, it’s going to be very expensive to hit an emissions target.” The government risked wasting public funds on technologies that don’t generate widespread industry uptake, Professor McKibbin said. “You give a whole bunch of companies a whole bunch of money and some of them walk away with a bonus when they shouldn’t get it in the first place,” he said. Economist and Climate Councillor Nicki Hutley said “chasing the unicorn of carbon capture and storage” would see taxes wasted and government must “be very careful when investing in technologies”. “We know picking winners is bad policy,” Ms Hutley said. “Any economist worth their salt says the way to go is to be technology-neutral. Impose a carbon price and let the market work out what’s most economically efficient,” Ms Hutley said. Mr Taylor said the government’s guiding principle in emissions reduction was “technology, not taxes”. “Our plan continues the policies and initiatives that we have already put in place and that have proven to be successful, while preserving existing industries and jobs, and supporting regional Australia,” Mr Taylor said. “It will not shut down coal or gas production, or require displacement of productive agricultural land.” The government selected technologies based on their comparative advantage for Australia, targeted at domestic economic opportunities, and potential to deliver significant emissions reductions in emerging opportunities rather than speculative initiatives. Labor leader Anthony Albanese accused the government of failing to provide details on how net zero would be achieved. “This government today, again, have not released any modelling,” Mr Albanese said on Tuesday. “They have not released any new initiatives. And in their own words, this plan is based on our existing policies.” Australia’s emissions have already fallen 20 per cent largely due to bans on land clearing, and the remaining 50 per cent required to hit net zero are expected to come from carbon offsets like tree planting (10 to 20 per cent), declining market demand for carbon-intensive products (15 per cent) and future unforeseen technology breakthroughs (15 per cent). Emma Herd, Ernst & Young’s climate change and sustainability partner said lowering the cost of technologies was only part of the solution and the road map did not show how Australia’s selected technologies would compete internationally. For example, large-scale batteries and hydrogen will compete as an energy storage technology. “It’s a highly competitive global landscape and other countries are putting in place policies to push through change” Ms Herd said, such as imposing a price on pollution and setting emissions caps on industries. with Nick Toscano Get daily updates on the climate summit that will shape our future.
