Musician Arturo Fermill, also known as D.J. Buddha Sax, says the demand of his services has only declined since the province’s announcement that capacity limits would be lifted. “I would usually have, in normal times, twenty to thirty gigs booked for Christmas parties, corporate events, even winter weddings right up until Christmas Eve but I currently have one that’s a ‘maybe,’ which will be eventually be cancelled due to the fact that their employees aren’t able to dance on the dance floor.” Story continues below advertisement Fermill believes the province underestimated how much revenue would be lost by B.C. small businesses when they chose to leave ‘indoor event dancing’ off the list of activities that were now allowed. “We now need the government to not have this oversight, because it really is an oversight.” Read more: B.C. lifting COVID-19 capacity limits on gatherings for much of province Micheal Ghirra, who is the owner of Riverside Banquet Halls, said the no-dancing rules and mask mandate have continued to dry up his business as well. “The announcement was great that we are at 100 per cent capacity at our banquet halls, but nothing has really changed with our businesses and our clients — they’re still not booking,” said Ghirra. “With Christmas parties, we typically do about 30 to 35 corporate events a year, but this year we’re down to, like, six — and out of those six, we just got a call last week that, because of the no-dancing and indoor-masking rules, that they’re just going to postpone until next year.” Meanwhile, Connolly is asking the province to make a decision this week on whether dancing will be allowed and the indoor-mask mandate lifted for indoor events so event organizers and staff can plan accordingly for the holiday season.

Ministry of Health pointed to earlier comments made by Dr. Bonnie Henry last week, highlighting her response to dancing not being allowed at live event venues. “We are watching that carefully and I hope to be able to take off more restrictions as we get through the next few months,” Henry had said at last Tuesday’s press conference. Although Connolly said she would prefer if both the indoor-mask mandate and dancing restrictions were lifted, there is one that would allow her businesses to thrive more. “If I had to pick one or the other, I would definitely say let us dance.” © 2021 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.",https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CP127988159.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=720&h=480&crop=1,globalnews,[],0.0,1.0,0.0

"Decades after polio, Martha is among the last to still rely on an iron lung to breathe",https://www.npr.org/2021/10/25/1047691984/decades-after-polio-martha-is-among-the-last-to-still-rely-on-an-iron-lung-to-br,,['Erin Kelly'],,Martha Lillard had just turned 5 years old when polio incapacitated her.

She still uses a form of the ventilator that saved her life as a child — though now she worries about replacement parts.(Image credit: Courtesy of Martha Lillard),2021-10-25 14:42:20,"Martha Lillard needed a large respirator called an iron lung to recover from polio, which she caught in 1953. She still uses a form of the device at nights. Courtesy of Martha Lillard hide caption Martha Lillard needed a large respirator called an iron lung to recover from polio, which she caught in 1953. She still uses a form of the device at nights. On June 8, 1953, Martha Lillard celebrated her fifth birthday with a party at an amusement park in Oklahoma. A little over a week later, she woke up with a sore throat and a pain in her neck. Her family took her to the hospital, where she was diagnosed with polio. She spent six months in the hospital, where she was put in a giant metal tank — a ventilator informally called an iron lung — to help her breathe. To this day, Lillard is one of the last people in the U.S. who still depends on an iron lung to survive. Polio is a potentially life-threatening disease, once among the world's most feared. In the late 1940s, polio disabled an average of 35,000 people in the U.S. every year. A polio vaccine became widely available in 1955, and millions of Americans got vaccinated. Since 1979, no cases of polio have originated in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The disease has been nearly eradicated — the World Health Organization documented only 175 cases of wild polio in 2019. It remains endemic in only Pakistan and Afghanistan. Although most people who contract polio will not have visible symptoms, a severe case can infect the brain and spinal cord and cause paralysis. Lillard's breathing muscles were weakened by the disease, and she survived thanks to the iron lung. Iron lung respirators are prepared in an emergency polio ward at a Boston hospital in August 1955. AP hide caption Iron lung respirators are prepared in an emergency polio ward at a Boston hospital in August 1955. The machines are giant ventilators about 7 feet long. Patients lie inside with just their heads resting outside; a seal around the patient's neck creates a vacuum. Bellows at the base of the device do the work of a human diaphragm — they create negative pressure so the user's lungs fill with air, and positive pressure allowing the person to exhale. Sixty-eight years later, an iron lung is still keeping Lillard alive — she sleeps in it every night. While many people who had polio or post-polio syndrome either weaned themselves off the machines or switched to another form of ventilator, Lillard never did. ""I've tried all the forms of ventilation, and the iron lung is the most efficient and the best and the most comfortable way,"" she told Radio Diaries . The antiquated machines are now more likely to be found in a museum than in someone's home. In the 1990s, when her iron lung was breaking down, she called hospitals and museums that might have had old ones in storage. But they'd either thrown them away or didn't want to part with their collection. She eventually bought one from a man in Utah — the machine she still uses today. The machines were once serviced by Philips Resperonic, but Lillard says the assistance she received from the company was minimal. Once, she says a technician was sent to service her machine and prepared to leave before putting the machine back together. Lillard has gotten stuck in the iron lung. She lost power when an ice storm came through Oklahoma and her emergency generator didn't kick on, leaving her trapped in the device without heat. ""It's like being buried alive almost, you know — it's so scary,"" Lillard says. She tried to call 911, but the cell towers weren't working. ""I was having trouble breathing. And I remember saying out loud to myself, 'I'm not going to die.' "" Lillard was eventually able to get a signal, but she remembers the emergency responders had no idea what an iron lung was. Luckily, they were able to get the generator going for her. Wear on parts is her main issue now. The belts need to be replaced every few weeks, the cot inside every six months, the motor every 12 years or so. Her most immediate need is collars. The collars create the critical airtight seal around the neck. Each one lasts only for a few months. And she has bought all the back stock of collars from places that don't produce them anymore. Martha Lillard says she worries about running out of replacement parts to make her iron lung respirator function properly. Courtesy of Martha Lillard hide caption ""That's the main thing I'm having a hard time with, because I try to stretch out, make these collars last longer,"" Lillard says. ""And when they start deteriorating, it gets harder and harder to breathe as they leak more."" She has only a handful of collars left. ""I really am desperate,"" she says. ""That's the most scary thing in my life right now — is not finding anybody that can make those collars."" Today, Lillard spends much of her time alone. She paints, watches old Hollywood movies and takes care of her beagles. She has been mostly isolating throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, seeing her sister, Cindy, and her brother-in-law, Daryl, in the evenings. Being affected by polio at such a young age has meant Lillard hasn't been able to have all the experiences others have had. She attended school from home for much of her childhood and couldn't participate in most extracurricular activities — she still remembers longing to go camping with her siblings. She was not able to have children or hold a steady job because of her physical limitations. Although some of her life experiences were limited, Lillard thanks a childhood friend named Karen Rapp for teaching her to appreciate small things. Together, they observed ants and built little villages of grass huts. ""There's much more to see if you really look for it,"" she says. And she's grateful for the iron lung. ""It's what sustains me. It's what heals me. It's what allows me to breathe the next day,"" Lillard says. ""I look at it as a friend, as a very dear friend.""

The figures are based on daily reports provided by health authorities in each country. They exclude revisions made by other statistical organisations, which show that the number of deaths is much higher. The World Health Organisation estimates that the pandemic’s overall toll could be two to three times higher than official records, due to the excess mortality that is directly and indirectly linked to COVID-19. A large number of the less severe or asymptomatic cases also remain undetected, despite intensified testing in many countries. On Saturday, 6,072 new deaths and 394,025 new cases were recorded worldwide. The countries with the highest figures for new deaths were Russia with 1,072, followed by the United States with 590 and India with 561.

The post This Not-So-Fierce Vegetarian Might Just Be Australia’s Oldest Dinosaur appeared first on Gizmodo Australia.","Ipswich, about 40 kilometres west of Brisbane, seems an unlikely place to find dinosaur fossils. Yet the area has produced the oldest evidence of dinosaurs in Australia. A fresh look at these fossils now reveals they aren’t what they first seemed, and it’s prompting us to reconsider how the story of Australia’s dinosaurs began. In research published in Historical Biology, we reanalyse a sequence of 220-million-year-old tracks from the Ipswich Coal Measures, thought to have belonged to a carnivorous dinosaur. We show they actually belonged to an early sauropodomorph — a distant relative of the plant-eating sauropods that roamed the planet much later, during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. This is the first time fossil evidence of early sauropodomorphs has been found in Australia. Subterranean dinosaur tracks The Ipswich area was once the principal source of coal for Queensland. Its suburbs including Ebbw Vale, New Chum and Swanbank were dotted with underground mines during the late 1800s and the first half of the twentieth century. These mining operations involved the creation of deep shafts and tunnels, from which miners could access deposits of coal sandwiched between other layers of rock. Some tunnels would descend hundreds of metres below the surface. The coal would be removed from the seam by hand, and pillars were left in its place to support the ceiling of the resulting underground “room”. It was difficult and dangerous work. In 1964, miners working at the Rhondda colliery in New Chum made a startling discovery. As they removed the coal from a seam they were following 213 metres below the surface, a series of giant, three-toed tracks became exposed in the ceiling of the mine shaft. For the miners, it was as if a dinosaur had just walked over their heads. These tracks remain the oldest-known dinosaur fossils in the entire continent. They’d been made by a dinosaur walking across a layer of swampy vegetation, which would be extracted as coal 220 million years later. Buried under fine silt and mud, they’d been preserved as natural casts. It had been assumed some type of predatory dinosaur made the tracks. The only problem was the footprints were reportedly about 40–46 centimetres long. This would suggest the track-maker was just under 2m high at the hips. This isn’t necessarily large for a theropod such as Allosaurus fragillis, which was about this size. Tyrannosaurus rex was even bigger, with a hip height of about 3.2m. But the tracks found in Ipswich were created during the Late Triassic about 220 million years ago — 65 million years before Allosaurus and 150 million years before T. rex. And fossil evidence from around the world indicates theropods of a larger size didn’t appear until the start of the Early Jurrasic Period, 200 million years ago. Was something unusual afoot in Australia during the Late Triassic? As part of a broader review of Australian dinosaur tracks, we decided to take a closer look at the Rhondda colliery tracks. The mine has long been closed, so the original tracks are no longer accessible, but archival photographs and a plaster cast are held at the Queensland Museum. Dispelling the myth of the ‘Triassic terror’ Using the photos and cast, we created a 3D digital model of the track to allow a more detailed comparison with other dinosaur tracks from around the world. Our study revealed two important things. First, the footprints were not as big as initially reported. Excluding drag marks and other unrelated surface features, they are close to 32–34cm long (not 40–46cm as previously documented). Second, the shape of the footprints and the sequence in which they were made is more consistent with early sauropodomorphs. Sauropodomorphs were the distant relatives of the lumbering sauropods of the Late Jurassic and subsequent Cretaceous Period. The towering Triassic terror of the Ipswich Coal Measures was no more. In its place was a peaceful plant-eater. The remains of early sauropodomorph dinosaurs have been found in Upper Triassic rocks, aged between 220 million and 200 million years, in continental Europe, Argentina, Brazil and South Africa. And by the start of the Jurassic, 200 million years ago, they had achieved a near global distribution, with fossils in North America, China and Antarctica. This isn’t surprising, given the continents at the time were still connected in a single landmass called Pangaea. Our new interpretation of the Rhondda colliery tracks shows early sauropodomorphs lived in Australia, too, and that Australia’s first dinosaurs were friendlier than we thought. Steven W.

How to Support a Person With Dementia as Lockdowns Ease,https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2021/10/dementia-lockdown-support/,"['Health', 'Life', 'au', 'brain health', 'lockdown']","['Lee-Fay Low', ' University of Sydney']",,"If your loved one has dementia, you might be wondering if their symptoms have worsened in lockdown, or if they remember who you are. The post How to Support a Person With Dementia as Lockdowns Ease appeared first on Lifehacker Australia.","Lockdowns lasting months in some states have seen tight restrictions on visitors to nursing homes. So as lockdowns ease, and if you’re vaccinated, you might be planning a happy reunion with your friend or family. If your loved one has dementia, you might be wondering if their symptoms have worsened in lockdown, or if they remember who you are. Here’s what to look out for on your first visit after lockdowns end, and how to support your loved one after that. Expect some decline Lockdowns can result in a decline in people with dementia, particularly those living in nursing homes. Research from lockdowns in 2020 showed people with dementia had more trouble thinking and problem-solving. Their behaviour and mood worsened. Some studies showed people were less able to do things around the home or look after themselves. Keeping mentally, physically and socially active helps people with dementia maintain their brain and thinking. But in lockdown, when people with dementia did less, they exercised their brains and bodies less. Lockdowns not only meant a ban on visitors to nursing homes, but limited stimulation from group activities, such as concerts, visits from schools and bus outings. During lockdowns, nursing home residents (more than half have dementia) also got worse in terms of their thinking and well-being. Residents sometimes didn’t understand why they couldn’t move freely around the nursing home, and why their loved ones had stopped visiting. This led to increases in behaviours, such as agitation. After lockdowns began, there has been an increase in prescriptions of psychotropic medications reported internationally. These medications are used in nursing homes to manage behaviours such as aggression and agitation. The first visit can be difficult Some families might be worried about their first visit in several months to a person living with dementia. They might be concerned their loved one has gotten worse, or scared they won’t recognise them. But it may help to think of visits as providing really important mental stimulation and human connection for your loved one, even though visits might be difficult emotionally for you. Introduce yourself: “Hi Dad, it’s Ali”, if it looks like your loved one can’t quite place who you are or your name. Read their reactions to you. If they need time to warm up to you (which might be disappointing if you are close), chat with someone else who is there. The person might enjoy your company even if they aren’t actively participating in the conversation at first. Then invite them to participate in the conversation by asking them their opinion: “How is the dog going?” or “I’m looking forward to going to the hairdresser, how about you?”. Prepare an activity to do together based on their interests. You could walk in the garden, browse a magazine about the royal family, sing along to a favourite album. If it’s a noisy gathering, find a quiet spot for one-on-one conversation, as the person may have trouble focusing when there are several people talking at once. READ MORE The Best Ways To Reduce the Risk of Dementia While You're Young Let them know when you’ll be back Because of your long separation, your loved one might be quite emotional or clingy when you are leaving. Let them know when you’ll be coming again. You can write this down in their calendar, or on a card to give them. You can also tell the nursing home staff so they can remind them. You can also leave a visual reminder of your visit. This could be a card or photograph, or some flowers with a note. If possible, get back into a visiting routine. If you notice a decline Families are more likely to notice small or marked changes in their loved one’s abilities if they have not seen them for several months. That might mean noticing early signs of dementia or worsening symptoms if they’ve already been diagnosed with it. So this can be a delicate conversation to have with your loved one. Many people can be defensive or in denial about changes, put it down to “old age”, and are afraid about having dementia. You might need to have the conversation several times to get them to see the doctor. Call the National Dementia Helpline on 1800 100 500 for advice. In the longer term, consider rehab Rehabilitation helps people with dementia. So it’s worth looking into what support services your loved one might need. A psychologist can help with strategies to manage memory and thinking; an occupational therapist can help with doing day-to-day things around the house; an exercise physiologist or physiotherapist can help with mobility; and a speech pathologist can help with communication. Family carers can talk to their loved one’s dementia specialist, or ask their GP for a Chronic Disease Management Plan for some subsidised rehabilitation sessions. If you’re not the main carer If you’re not the main family carer, make sure that person has some support. Ask how they are feeling and what support you can offer. Carers have been providing more help during lockdowns to people with dementia living in the community. That’s because there have been fewer services on offer, and as people with dementia needed help to comply with restrictions.

"Kids with obesity need acceptance from family and friends, not just better diet tips, to succeed at managing their weight",https://theconversation.com/kids-with-obesity-need-acceptance-from-family-and-friends-not-just-better-diet-tips-to-succeed-at-managing-their-weight-168908,,"['Amanda Harrist', ' Professor in Human Development and Family Science', ' Oklahoma State University']",,,"Obesity intervention programs tend to focus on healthy food and physical activity. But is that enough? kali9/E+ Collection via Getty ImagesHundreds of programs over the past four decades – from the removal of junk food from school vending machines to Michelle Obama’s “Let’s Move” campaign – have tried to get kids in the U.S. to eat healthier food and exercise more often. But none of these efforts lowered national child obesity rates. In fact, child obesity has continued to increase. This has been particularly true during the pandemic. We think we know why. Most programs that seek to lower children’s body mass index, or BMI, focus on healthy food and physical activity. But as child obesity researchers who specialize in human development and family science, we know that slimming down requires much more than attention to diet and exercise. Those factors are important, but we found that acceptance from family and friends also plays a critical role in slowing the rate of weight gain for children with obesity. To reach this conclusion, we collaborated with colleagues to follow almost 1,200 children in first through fourth grades in rural Oklahoma to find out more about the lives of kids who are overweight or obese. Our intervention programs allowed us to compare a traditional food and exercise approach to managing child obesity with approaches that also targeted the social and emotional aspects of children’s lives. Family and peer acceptance We conducted a randomized controlled trial in 29 Oklahoma schools. More than 500 first graders who were at-risk for obesity – meaning their BMI was above the 75th percentile – were assigned to either a control group or a group that received a combination of three interventions. These interventions focused on family lifestyle, family dynamics and the peer group. [Explore the intersection of faith, politics, arts and culture. Sign up for This Week in Religion.] The family lifestyle intervention focused on healthy food and physical activity. Participants learned to use a color-coded food reference guide similar to this one when selecting food. Parents tracked their children’s food consumption and physical activity, and also learned how to avoid conflict over food. This conflict might involve arguing about how much the child is eating, whether the child can have dessert or whether the child has eaten enough of everything else on the table to get a second helping of a favorite food. The family dynamics intervention added parenting skills and healthy emotion management. Children’s emotion regulation and emotional eating are significantly related, so teaching children to manage their feelings may reduce their tendency to eat when they are stressed out or upset. Children were taught how to deal with negative emotions, express their feelings and value their uniqueness. Parents were taught to value their children’s emotions, provide comfort and understanding, support children’s problem-solving and accept their children as they are. The peer group intervention taught social acceptance in the children’s school classrooms. Our research has shown that the more children weigh, the more their classmates tend to dislike them. However we’ve also demonstrated that we can decrease the rejection that happens in elementary school classrooms by teaching children to be more accepting of one another. Teaching kids to be more accepting of one another can reduce weight stigma and rejection. kali9/E+ Collection via Getty Images Effect on obesity We measured children’s heights and weights at the beginning of first grade and then after the intervention – in first, second, third and fourth grades. Only those children with obesity who received all three interventions – family lifestyle, family dynamics and peer group – had significant decreases in BMI gains compared with the control group. Ongoing analysis indicates that the peer group intervention was particularly important for children who were severely obese, with a BMI in the 99th percentile. Our results show that to reduce BMI gains in the early school years, kids need more than healthy food and physical activity. They need parents who encourage their healthy choices and accept their emotions. Knowing you can come home and talk about how angry and sad you are is essential to healthy physical and mental growth. And children must also have friends and peers who accept them for who they are – regardless of how much they weigh.

Prepping your oven for the holidays in the last... The post Now’s the Time to Prep Your Oven for the Holidays appeared first on Lifehacker Australia.","Fortune may favour the bold, but the holidays favour the prepared. Prepping your oven for the holidays in the last week of October may seem like overkill, but repairmen can be hard to schedule (getting you out to your home can take weeks!), and it’s best to identify any oven issues well ahead of time so as not to add to your peak holiday stress. Check your oven for potential issues now, and you’ll have plenty of time to fix them before pie baking season. Make sure it’s not lying with an oven thermometer First, make sure your oven isn’t a lying liar that lies. Baking things is something of a trust exercise: You press some buttons to set the temperature, the oven tells you when it has reached that temperature, and you put the food in the oven, never questioning the veracity of the appliance’s claim. Being off by a few degrees isn’t the biggest deal, especially if all you’re doing is roasting vegetables and baking potatoes. But larger temperature discrepancies can cause problems, especially with more finicky baking projects, dishes with long cook times (like the giant ceremonial bird), and new recipes. Checking the accuracy of your oven’s temperature display is very easy: Get an oven thermometer and use it. Your oven’s internal thermometer only reads the temp of the location where it was installed, usually towards the back or in the front. Food, as you know, doesn’t get cooked in the back or front of the oven — it gets cooked in the centre. So grab an external thermometer and place it there. (Brand-wise, Cook’s Illustrated recommends this basic, very cheap dial face model, but you can also use a digital probe model, like this one from Thermoworks.) Set your thermometer (or thermometer probe) in the centre of your oven and set the temperature to 350℉. Once the oven says it’s heated to the target temperature, check your thermometer and write the actual reading down. Repeat every 15 minutes for two hours, then take the average by adding all the readings together and dividing that sum by the number of readings — that’s your oven temperature. (Averaging will account for any fluctuations caused by cycling, i.e., your oven turning off and on to maintain the target temp.) If your oven has been lying all along, you can set it straight by adjusting your oven’s temperature dial. The steps involved will be slightly different for every make and model of oven, so check your owner’s manual. (ThermPro has an outline for the procedure here, but I cannot guarantee it’s geared to the oven in your kitchen.) Check for hot spots with coconut and bread Even if your oven is giving accurate temperature readouts, it’s unlikely the whole oven is the exact same temp in every single spot. Most ovens have hot spots and cold spots, and you can map them using shredded coconut. To make a map, set your oven to 180ºC and scatter some shredded coconut on a sheet pan in an even layer. Place the sheet pan in the oven, and take note of which spots brown the fastest (and the slowest). If you want to map your broiler in a similar fashion, grab a bunch of sliced bread, lay it out on a sheet pan (or directly on the rack) and give the slices a broil, taking note of which pieces brown the fastest. Consult the maps as needed to prevent your delicious dishes from overcooking, undercooking, or flat-out burning Clean the damn thing If you do nothing else to prepare your oven for the holidays, at least give it a deep clean. Old, stuck-on food and grimy oil spots can smoke or catch fire and ruin your food (and — in some extreme cases — your entire oven), so get rid of them. The self-cleaning function can be used sparingly to incinerate built-up gunk (make sure all grease is wiped out first so you don’t start a oil fire), but if yours doesn’t have one of those, or you don’t want to use it, you can get the job done with ammonia, dish soap, and baking soda.

And also, what’s the difference between a booster and a third dose? This and more in the latest video. On 18th October, Malaysia has fully vaccinated 22.9 million individuals which is equivalent to 70.2% of the total population. This puts Malaysia ahead of several developed nations including Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, South Korea and the United States in terms of fully vaccinated rates. Perbezaan antara dos tambahan dan dos penggalak. #BoosterShots #vaccinated pic.twitter.com/YGMSQXsJvs— KKMalaysia (@KKMPutrajaya) October 15, 2021 Malaysia has begun offering booster shots for senior citizens and high-risk groups. A booster shot is administered to fully vaccinated individuals who have gotten sufficient protection earlier but the protection levels may wane over time. For Pfizer recipients, a booster shot is given 6 months after individuals are fully vaccinated. Meanwhile, individuals who have been fully vaccinated with Sinovac are also eligible to receive Pfizer as the booster shot at least 3 months after getting the second dose. The third dose is defined as additional doses for people who are immunocompromised as they may not have sufficient immune response after receiving two doses of the vaccine. This includes cancer patients, organ recipients, kidney patients who require dialysis and individuals who can’t get enough protection from the standard two-dose vaccination. The third dose will be administered at least 28 days after receiving the second dose. As more travel restrictions are being lifted, Malaysia is currently conducting a “test and release” pilot programme where individuals returning to Malaysia may skip quarantine. The pilot program is currently open to rulers, ministers, members of Parliament and government officials travelling overseas, and it is expected to be extended to business travellers. To participate in the pilot programme, eligible individuals must submit supporting documents to the National Security Council and the Ministry of Health. A mandatory RT-PCR test is required 3 days before departing for Malaysia and another test at the entry point upon arrival in the country. The test and release pilot is only applicable for individuals travelling to low-risk countries. As more teenagers are getting vaccinated, the cinema SOPs have been revised to allow all fully vaccinated individuals regardless of age to enter. This is applicable to Sarawak and states under Phase 4 of the National Recovery Plan. This is our second last episode and we will release our final video of the COVID-19 vaccine Malaysia series this week.

Australia's 'underclass' don't like work? Our research shows  vulnerable job seekers don't get the help they need,https://theconversation.com/australias-underclass-dont-like-work-our-research-shows-vulnerable-job-seekers-dont-get-the-help-they-need-169609,,"[""Siobhan O'Sullivan"", ' Associate professor', ' UNSW']",,,"James Ross/AAPFormer NSW minister Pru Goward wrote a column in the Australian Financial Review last week about Australia’s “underclass,” who she says are lazy, dysfunctional and don’t like the “discipline” of work. This was condemned by anti-poverty advocates as disturbing, but it was not terribly surprising. Australia has a long history of stigmatising those without work. The idea that unemployed people are work-shy is also conveyed in one of Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s catchphrases: “the best form of welfare is a job”. But this is not always a straightforward proposition. In our upcoming book, Buying and Selling the Poor, we tell the story of the offices and frontline staff who work with the most vulnerable job seekers. We wanted to find out why some employment agencies do better at helping very disadvantaged people find jobs, given that the welfare-to-work system has such a high failure rate when it comes to the long-term unemployed. Welfare-to-work in Australia Australia has the world’s only fully privatised welfare-to-work system. It is a multibillion dollar industry, involving about 40 private agencies who help job seekers become “job ready” through training and face-to-face meetings with case managers. To receive unemployment payments, you must be also be looking for work. Dan Peled/AAP The system has a reputation for being efficient – a 2019 parliamentary report noted there had been more than one million job placements since mid-2015. Indeed, most of those on JobSeeker (unemployment) payments are only temporarily out of work due to factors like layoffs, economic downturns in their industry, or the nature of casual work. But there are also hundreds of thousands of Australians for whom unemployment lasts years. These are people who may not have worked for a long time because of caring responsibilities, disability or illness. Others may have limited education or complex issues such as addiction or homelessness. As the Reserve Bank reported in December 2020, around one in every five unemployed people have been unemployed for more than a year. This is up from around one in every eight a decade ago. Our study Our research was based on four job services agencies that were “high performing” in terms of getting long-term unemployed people into work. This included one in suburban Melbourne, one in outer Melbourne, another in Melbourne’s inner-city and a fourth in regional NSW. All four offices were among the top job services in Victoria and NSW based on the proportion of clients they had placing into jobs lasting 26 weeks or more in the year before our study (according to government data). Over 18 months from late 2016 to early 2018, we sat in these offices, watching and documenting all interactions for days at a time. We interviewed agency staff and followed the fate of about 100 disadvantaged clients (namely, job seekers who had been assessed by Centrelink as being least “job ready” and so needing the most employment support). No single winning formula Our study showed there is no singular underlying formula to help the most disadvantaged job seekers. Some offices displayed high levels of team work (with colleagues actively helping each other with clients), while others were more skilled at connecting with employers and took advantage of being close to centres of light industry and a good supply of suitable jobs. Read more: Our research shows more Australians receive unemployment payments than you think But, taken as a whole, the picture was one of relatively marginal returns. The difference between being an “average” and an “outstanding” provider of services to highly disadvantaged job seekers (based on government performance data) may be as low as placing one or two additional people a into a job that they hold for 26 weeks. This suggests the Australian system remains largely unable to reliably assist vulnerable job seekers. Problems right from the start When people first claim JobSeeker payments, Centrelink organises them into one of three service streams: A (most “job ready”), B or C (“hardest to help”). Stream C accounts for around 16% of job services’ caseload and about 44% of this group have been clients with employment services for more than five years. This categorisation is important - it determines the level of support (such as funding for training) a job seeker is eligible for. Providers also earn more for helping clients into work if they are in Stream C. Job services can easily get bogged down in paperwork. Stefan Postles/AAP Our work confirmed previous research, such as that of the Refugee Council of Australia – the tool used to classify job seekers is not an accurate measure of the real conditions for these clients. This is because job seekers are often reluctant to disclose deeply personal issues such as domestic violence or criminal records to strangers at Centrelink. As a result, job services then invest considerable energy having job seekers reclassified, or “up-streamed,” from an A to a B or C. This involves sending clients back to Centrelink for reassessment, which can take months and months. So there is less time spent connecting with people’s needs and more time doing administration. Staff with few specialist skills We also encountered a system staffed by people with little specialist skills and job security. When job services were privatised 30 years ago, many frontline staff came from a professional or social work background. Today, it is predominantly staffed by those without tertiary qualifications. Case workers are former hairdressers, bakers, flight attendants, hospitality workers and carpenters. Some have been long-term unemployed themselves. Read more: Robodebt was a fiasco with a cost we have yet to fully appreciate Some of the staff specifically told us their job is not to help solve job seekers’ personal problems and crises (they are not “counsellors”). The pay is low, the work can be stressful, with pressure to hit targets and little time to connect with people and the turnover is high. This inevitably means those who really need help are not necessarily receiving a specialist service. Some good news We also saw repeated examples of staff doing everything they could to make sure the system was not too brutal or indifferent to vulnerable people. While the computer-driven system prompts staff to penalise (which may result in docked payments) jobs seekers for misdemeanours as small as arriving late to appointments, we saw staff exercising compassion and finding ways around this. We saw staff who knew all the agencies’ clients by name and who worked as a team. If an employer had multiple vacancies, staff would place any and all “job-ready” job seekers into the position, regardless of who their official case manager was. A human heart still beats within the system. More change coming From mid-next year, right as the labour market tries to recover from COVID-19, a radical change is coming. Welfare-to-work will be done primarily online, with an app for case management. If this does not result in a job within 18 months, the job seeker – then classified as long-term unemployed – will likely be moved into a face-to-face system. Job services will become digitised from mid-2022. www.shutterstock.com The government says more money will be invested into programs for young people and skills training. But welfare advocates warn the old problems of “too little help and too much policing” will just be replicated in the new system. Moreover, what this digitisation will mean for vulnerable job seekers (particularly those who don’t have good computer skills or up-to-date technology) is yet to play out. Our study’s overall conclusion is the current system does not work for the most disadvantaged clients. The approach to helping people into work is transactional – even at the best of agencies. Whether a job is indeed the best form of welfare or not, this is far from easy to achieve for some Australians, even with the “assistance” of face-to-face employment services.

Today, the Lachine Rapids are mostly an attraction for surfers, sport kayakers and riverside picnickers, but the death of 58-year-old Pierre Lacroix is a reminder that Montreal owes its very existence to their dangerous nature. Lacroix was one of four firefighters who were on a boat that capsized last Sunday night while trying to help a couple in another boat in distress. While the others were all rescued, Lacroix died after becoming trapped under the boat. Louise Desrosiers, a spokeswoman for the Montreal fire department, said rescue boats typically avoid venturing into the fast-moving current of the rapids. “It’s a sector that’s dangerous, so boats will go upstream to save people or downstream to recuperate people who have passed through the rapids,” she said in a phone interview. Desrosiers says eight fire stations have nautical rescue units, all staffed by specially trained employees. Calls for help are initially categorized as either “engine trouble” or the more serious “maritime emergency,” which usually happens when someone is in the water or in immediate danger. While the boaters in the incident involving Lacroix had first reported an engine stall, Desrosiers said she couldn’t confirm how the call had been categorized. An investigation into his death remains ongoing. Michel Martin, a prevention officer with the Canadian Coast Guard Auxiliary, describes the rapids as “unforgiving” and “a trap.” Since he began with the service in 2014, he said he’s seen more and more boaters, paddle boarders and fishermen out on the water – some of them inexperienced or unaware when they first start getting caught in the current. He said the auxiliary coast boats, like the fire rescue, don’t venture into the rapids because the boats aren’t designed for the conditions he describes as rocky and unpredictable, with fast-moving water that varies from a third of a metre to three metres deep. “We’ll do everything to help people in distress, but not at the expense of the life of our members,” he said in a phone interview. Lacroix is far from the first person to lose his life in the dangerous waters of the rapids. For better or worse, the rushing waters have shaped the city’s existence from its earliest days, according to historian Denis Gravel. “Montreal wouldn’t be Montreal without the rapids,” said Gravel, who specializes in municipal history. While the island was long used as a meeting and fishing place for Indigenous people, it served as a roadblock for European explorers including Jacques Cartier and Samuel de Champlain, who stopped after learning their ships could not proceed further upriver. Until the Lachine Canal opened in 1825 to bypass the rapids, goods heading toward the Great Lakes had to be unloaded in the Montreal area or portaged — leading to the city developing as an area of trade and settlement. “From the beginning of European settlement, there are “many, many stories of shipwrecks and danger, of people who drowned or went fishing and didn’t pay attention,” Gravel said. One of the earliest reported incidents involved an associate of Champlain’s who headed to a nearby island along with two Indigenous men. Their boat, laden with birds, capsized on the way back, and two of the three drowned. While the rapids were nearly impassable heading west, boats would still try to run the rapids the other way. Some were rafts laden with goods and steered by specialist pilots who, despite their skill, sometimes lost their cargo to the current. Later, steamboats carried tourists looking for a thrill. In 1873 one such boat, the Louis Renaud, crashed in the rapids, reportedly avoiding tragedy thanks to the Mohawks from nearby Kahnawake who came to the passengers’ aid. There have been other incidents in more recent years. A fisherman died after losing his footing in 2010, and a surfer died after falling at a popular surfing locale dubbed the standing wave in 2013. This summer, a man disappeared after falling off a boat. The number of rescues in Montreal’s waters appears to be rising, although mishaps at the rapids have remained stable. The Montreal fire department has seen a 30 per cent increase in the overall number of nautical incidents since 2019 — something Desrosiers says could be attributable to the rising popularity of outdoor sports during the COVID-19 pandemic. Desrosiers says it’s important for boaters, especially less experienced ones, to remember the St. Lawrence’s strong currents make it challenging to navigate. She said it’s also crucial for boaters to familiarize themselves with their vessels and the places where they’re boating, to avoid drugs and alcohol and to wear a properly-fitted life-jacket.

KUCHING, Oct 26 ― A Parti Sarawak Bersatu (PSB) man has called upon the state government to provide all low-income households in rural Sarawak with free Covid-19 self-test kits.In pointing this out, PSB Mulu pro tem chairman Prof Son Radu believed that there were signs of a surge in new Covid-19 cases and deaths.“Deaths from Covid-19 have remained high, in the double digits range. Equally alarming is the number of brought-in-dead (BID) cases.“There are now field hospitals, which are typically associated with war zones, in Miri, Sibu and Kuching. The one in Kuching is sponsored by Mercy Malaysia.“Sarawak’s intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacity has hit the 80 per cent occupied level. The seldom-told part of this is the ICU beds are cramped in a very limited space.“Indeed, these are not signs that anybody should be comfortable with. My fear is that Sarawak might not be able to enter into the endemic stage at any time soon, as Malaysia is expected to enter Phase 4 (of the National Recovery Plan) by next month – the stage some are referring to as the endemic stage,” said Son, who is also PSB’s potential state election candidate for Mulu.He said it did not help when Minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Dato Sri Alexander Nanta Linggi had said recently that the state’s ruling coalition, Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS), wanted to hold the 12th state election ‘before the Covid-19 vaccines’ effectiveness waned’.“In view of these things and to ensure that Sarawakians, particularly the rural-based Sarawakians, are able to both actively and effectively practise ‘intelligent living’, I urge the Sarawak government to, on the most urgent basis, provide all those in the B40 (low-income) and the lower rung of the M40 (medium-income) households with Covid-19 self-test kits.“The number of kits provided should be enough for all members of each household to administer self-test every fortnightly, until two weeks after the 12th state election is held, at the very least,” said the PSB man.Son said the endemic stage, once officially declared, would be the stage where the government had acknowledged that ‘the Covid-19 is here to stay’.In the meantime, he also appealed to the GPS-led government to not hold the next state election before the lifting of the Emergency scheduled in February next year.“Use the remaining three months to manage this pandemic well so that the 12th state election could be safely held either in February or March next year,” he added. ― Borneo Post",2021-10-26 02:10:38,,,malaymail,"[('Parti Sarawak Bersatu (PSB)', 'MEDICINE')]",0.1,0.6,0.4
Fauci says vaccines for kids between 5 and 11 likely available in November,https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/anthony-fauci-covid-19-vaccines-kids-likely-available-november,,['Reuters'],,"Once authorized, roughly 28 million more children in the United States would be eligible to receive what would be the first US COVID-19 vaccine for younger kids","Vaccines for kids between the ages of 5 and 11 will likely be available in the first half of November, top US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said on Sunday, October 24, predicting a timetable that could see many kids getting fully vaccinated before the end of the year. “If all goes well, and we get the regulatory approval and the recommendation from the CDC, it’s entirely possible if not very likely that vaccines will be available for children from 5 to 11 within the first week or two of November,” Fauci said in an interview with ABC’s This Week. US Food and Drug Administration officials are reviewing the Pfizer/BioNTech application seeking authorization of its 2-dose vaccine for younger children, with its panel of outside advisers scheduled to weigh in on Oct. 26. The FDA typically follows the advice of its panel but is not required to do so. Advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will weigh in on recommendations for the vaccine at a meeting on November 2 and November 3, helping to inform a final decision by its director. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, speaking at Fox News Sunday, also said the agency wanted to act swiftly. “After they (FDA) are able to review all the science and conduct the regulatory action and the CDC will meet, and if all of that goes smoothly … we will act quickly,” she said. “We know how many parents are interested in getting their children between 5 and 11 vaccinated and we intend to act as quickly as we can,” she added. Once authorized, roughly 28 million more children in the United States would be eligible to receive what would be the first US COVID-19 vaccine for younger kids. The Pfizer/BioNTech shot is already available to those ages 12-17, and the companies are still studying it for children younger than 5. While children have a lower rate of death from COVID-19, many face illness and long-term symptoms that are still being studied. Many adults who have been hesitant or opposed to the COVID-19 vaccine, and even some who did not oppose the vaccine for themselves, are expected to resist giving the shot to their children. Asked if schools should mandate a vaccine for kids, Walensky said: “Right now we are at authorization. We’re having discussions about authorization.

The lesson for investors is clear: steer clear of this troubled company. Another bad quarter Three months ago, many airlines expected to be profitable during the third quarter, thanks to a strong rebound in summer leisure travel. However, despite the improving demand environment, American Airlines never expected to turn a profit in Q3, mainly due to its high cost structure and crippling interest costs. Management's initial guidance called for American to log an adjusted pre-tax margin between -3% and -7%, with revenue down 20% from the third quarter of 2019. Adding to the airline's woes, demand stalled out near the beginning of August as U.S. COVID-19 case numbers surged. In early September, American Airlines slashed its quarterly forecast, saying that it expected revenue to fall 24% to 28% from Q3 2019, leading to an adjusted pre-tax margin between -10% and -14%. Ultimately, American's third-quarter revenue totaled $9 billion, down 25% from two years ago. The company recorded an adjusted pre-tax loss of $833 million, putting its adjusted pre-tax margin at -9.3%: better than its most recent forecast but still considerably worse than its initial quarterly guidance. (American did earn a $169 million profit under generally accepted accounting principles , but that included a substantial benefit from the final batch of federal payroll support grants.) Image source: American Airlines. To put American's results in context, key rival Delta Air Lines ( NYSE:DAL ) reported a modest Q3 adjusted profit earlier this month. Meanwhile, United Airlines ( NASDAQ:UAL ) posted a smaller adjusted pre-tax loss of $473 million, which translated to a -6.1% adjusted pre-tax margin . The fourth quarter will be worse American Airlines' financial results will likely deteriorate further in the fourth quarter, which tends to be a seasonally weaker period for airlines. On Thursday, the company said that it expects revenue to fall 20% compared to Q4 2019 on 11% to 13% less capacity. Adding to the earnings pressure, nonfuel unit costs are on pace to rise 8% to 10% over that period and fuel prices could spike by roughly 20% compared to the $2.05 per gallon that American paid two years ago. Based on these projections, management expects American Airlines to report an awful -16% to -18% adjusted pre-tax margin this quarter. That implies a pre-tax loss of roughly $1.5 billion. Unless American beats these targets by a country mile, its Q4 financial results will lag those of Delta and United again. United Airlines' guidance implies an adjusted pre-tax loss of around $1 billion this quarter, and Delta Air Lines in turn will post a much smaller loss than United. Massive risk and little upside Analysts currently expect most U.S. airlines to earn substantial profits next year (assuming no additional pandemic-related setbacks). By contrast, the analyst consensus currently calls for American Airlines to earn a negligible profit in 2022. Image source: American Airlines. American Airlines' weak balance sheet makes its persistently weak profitability particularly dangerous. American ended last quarter with $38.3 billion of debt, plus around $15 billion of pension and lease liabilities. Moreover, the airline used over $1.7 billion of cash in its operations last quarter. Based on its weak Q4 earnings forecast, it will likely burn even more cash this quarter. To be fair, American ended last quarter with $14.5 billion of unrestricted cash and investments, giving it time to turn things around. However, the company has nearly $20 billion of debt maturing between now and the end of 2025. If American Airlines still isn't generating meaningful earnings and cash flow within a couple of years, it could struggle to repay or refinance all that debt. That creates substantial risk for investors. On the flip side, American Airlines' fully diluted market cap has rebounded beyond its January 2020 (i.e., pre-pandemic) level. Thus, investors aren't getting a discount for bearing this risk, making American Airlines stock extremely unattractive.",,fool,[],0.0,1.0,0.0
Millions of ‘filthy’ used medical gloves reportedly imported into US,https://nypost.com/2021/10/25/filthy-bloodstained-used-medical-gloves-imported-into-us/,,['Sam Raskin'],,"Millions of filthy, used medical gloves -- some even obviously bloodstained -- were imported into the US from Thailand amid a shortage of personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Millions of filthy, used medical gloves -- some even obviously bloodstained -- were imported into the US from Thailand amid a shortage of personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic.",2021-10-25 18:49:06,"Millions of filthy, used medical gloves — some even obviously bloodstained — were imported into the US from Thailand amid a shortage of personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a disturbing report. A months-long investigation by CNN found that the soiled, second-hand nitrile gloves were shipped to desperate US distributors after import regulations were suspended at the start of the pandemic to address surging demand. “There was just no other answer. There was no way to meet the demand,” industry expert Douglas Stein said told CNN. “But that opened the floodgates for all the nefarious behavior.” Stein described the medical-grade nitrile gloves as the “most dangerous commodity on Earth right now.” “There’s an enormous amount of bad product coming in. An endless stream of filthy, second-hand and substandard gloves coming into the US of which federal authorities, it seems, are only now beginning to understand the enormous scale,” he said. A criminal investigation surrounding the operation is now underway by authorities in Thailand and America. Miami businessman Tarek Kirschen was one of the US distributors who unwittingly ordered the unsanitary gloves. Kirschen told CNN he ordered about $2 million worth of gloves from Thai-based company Paddy the Room late last year. “We start getting phone calls from clients completely upset, and you know, yelling and screaming at us saying, ‘Hey, you screwed us,’” he told the outlet. “These were reused gloves. They were washed, recycled,” he said. “Some of them were dirty. Some of them had bloodstains. Some of them had markers on them with dates from two years ago … I couldn’t believe my eyes.” Kirschen said he tossed the gloves, refunded the money to his customers, and alerted the FDA in February 2021. He stressed none of the second-hand protective gloves he ordered were used in medical settings. However, the CNN investigation found that American distributors bought around 200 million gloves from Paddy the Room. It’s unclear what happened to those gloves after they entered the country. US Customs and Border Protection told CNN it had seized about 40 million counterfeit face masks and hundreds of thousands of other PPE items — but the agency says it does not count the specific amount of glove seizures. Meanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security began “Operation Stolen Promise” with the aim of stopping the flow of illicit PPE into the US. DHS Investigations Special Operations Agent Mike Rose told CNN the agency had made 2,000 seizures of supposed COVID-19-related treatments and PPE. “I think DHS has been a model around the world for how best to coordinate efforts among different agencies to really stop the import, the transactions and all the other surrounding criminal activity around COVID,” Rose insisted to the outlet.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Medicalgloves.jpg?quality=90&strip=all,nypost,[],0.0,0.8,0.3

She said: “I think people need to remember as well that it’s not the health care workers’ fault. “I believe the morale is quite low in some of the maternity hospitals amongst the midwives and doctors and that’s not fair because they’re getting the brunt of it. “So I just really hope the clinical governments across all of the hospitals adhere to the guidelines.” ‘FEEL STRONG’ Terries said that she is feeling “amazing” at the moment and that she is comfortable going into the scans on her own without her husband as she is used to a clinical setting.

Programs like the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS), the Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy (CERS) and the Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB) are set to be replaced with new measures in their place. Though Canada’s devastated tourism and service industry, still reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic, continues to recover, business owners and employees say that those lifelines are the only things keeping them afloat. Read more: Canada’s COVID-19 benefits: A look at what’s expiring and what’s new Aleksander Saiyan, the operations director for Toronto Dance Salsa, said that if he hadn’t made use of those programs, his dance studio would have been shut down. Story continues below advertisement “There’s no way we could have covered the rent, we would have went into a massive debt,” said Saiyan, who made use of the CRB for himself and other government programs for his business. Dance studios, much like gyms and exercise spaces, were widely considered “grey areas” in what provincial governments decided to shut down during their pandemic-induced lockdowns. While Ontario’s provincial government continues its gradual re-opening of the economy, including most recently an announcement of full capacity for gyms and restaurants set for this Monday, Saiyan said business is still just a fraction of what it was prior to the pandemic. 4:38 Pandemic rent and wage subsidies coming to an end Pandemic rent and wage subsidies coming to an end Saiyan says the business is now just operating on little more than 30 per cent of the revenue it was earning pre-COVID, and that every “penny” and more that they’ve saved up in previous years has already gone forward to cover bills like rent, electricity and wages. Story continues below advertisement “So it is scary, extremely scary, and we wholeheartedly depend on this to recover,” said Saiyan. “And I’m hoping that in January, February, things will get better and we start to go to some kind of normal.” In an announcement Thursday, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland said that new programs would be put in place to replace the pandemic measures. The new Tourism and Hospitality Recovery Program and Hardest Hit Business Recovery Program are set to come into effect Sunday, according to Freeland.

The CRB, which was formerly known as the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), will also be replaced by a more targeted program called the Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit (CWLB). While the new programs are said to be more targeted to those that need them the most, many are concerned that it won’t be enough to keep them and their businesses afloat. David Macdonald, a senior economist for the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, wrote that as many 1.5 million people could be directly impacted by the replacement of those programs — most of whom won’t have another source of income or support. Story continues below advertisement 2:18 Uncertainty as Ottawa ends wage and rent subsidies Uncertainty as Ottawa ends wage and rent subsidies Of that number, about 900,000 workers would lose support from the CRB’s eligibility and income cut, while over 640,000 workers could see their jobs in jeopardy over the CERS and CEWS cuts. “The real elephant in the room is CRB support for self-employed workers,” said Macdonald. “While several of the other programs have seen significant decline in take-up recently, the CRB has not.” Those interested in the CRB’s replacement, the CWLB, would only be eligible for it once a province or city imposes a COVID-19 lockdown, Macdonald wrote. “At this point, there doesn’t seem to be any place in Canada under lockdown and so there would be no one eligible for the CWLB at the time of writing.” Read more: Don’t stop federal COVID-19 benefits, businesses say as expiration nears Story continues below advertisement There are currently no provinces or cities in lockdown, but Freeland defended the new measures — adding that temporary local lockdowns were “still a possibility” in the months to come. “Our emergency support measures were always designed to be temporary to get us through the crisis,” she said. “We’re now in a new phase, one that is very different from the darkest days in our fight against COVID. We have recovered lost jobs.” Small business owners have previously called on the federal government to not stop COVID-19 benefits ahead of their expiration — calling it a lifeline for their livelihoods. Rina Camarra, the manager of Mastro’s Restaurant in Toronto, told Global News in September that her business was on the wage subsidy program over the months-long pandemic. 5:33 Looming expiry of pandemic financial supports leaves small businesses wary Looming expiry of pandemic financial supports leaves small businesses wary “It’s not an easy task for us to run a business nowadays,” said Camarra.

It could also summarize the state of Big Oil and the traditional energy sector in this post-covid, new ESG-focused era. “Put simply, the Covid-19 pandemic has created the biggest shock to the global energy system since at least World War II,” David Turk , then-Deputy Director of the International Energy Agency (IEA) told the Senate Energy and Commerce Committee on June 16, 2020. Turk is now Deputy Secretary of Energy. It also forced the much-needed transformation, according to Deloitte’s head of the Energy, Resources and Industrials practice, Kathryn Pavlovsky. She told me on my Electric Ladies podcast recently that Covid provided a “dry-run” for Big Oil and the energy sector writ large for what we need to do to avert the irreversible, catastrophic potential impacts of climate change. “It's going to be that rate of decline that is needed to achieve some of the commitments that we're making across the globe…by the timeline of 2050,” adding that, “it's really interesting to see what it required in the last 18 months to actually hit that and what it means going forward.” GLASGOW, SCOTLAND - OCTOBER 13: Artists paint a mural on a a wall next to the Clydeside Expressway ...

Surround Yourself With Amazing Latina Women In past economic crises, talk of protecting the environment might have taken a back seat to getting the economy back on track. Not this time. “What is intriguing,” Pavlovsky said, “is that the dialogue around environmental, social, governance, and climate did not slow in the (energy) sector in part, because I think it was obvious the evidence of what actually can be realized when we have, our activities reduced, whether it's on the commercial level, whether it's on the personal level.” Here are six ways Pavlovsky said covid jolted Big Oil and the energy ecosystem into an ESG-focused “new normal”: Kathryn Pavlovsky, head of Deloitte's Energy, Resources & Industrials practice Deloitte · Changed demands for energy : When millions of people are continuing to work remotely, or coming to the office part-time, Pavlovsky asks, “Are you just displacing the consumption, or are you actually reducing it?” And, what does that mean, “recognizing that the cost models that (they) operated on the past, aren't going to carry forward into the future?” · Big Oil goes “net zero”: “ Many (energy) companies during the height of the pandemic were announcing their net zero goals,” Pavlovsky pointed out, “Certain of the super majors like BP and Shell actually hardened their goals and announced production cuts going forward over the next decade through automation and looking for opportunities to do this.” BP said it will be net zero by 2050 “or sooner,” seeking to “decarbonize and diversify into different forms of energy, such as renewables, biofuels ‎and hydrogen,” while also keeping oil and gas in their mix.

For example, Exxon-Mobil was forced by activist investors to swap out a couple of long-term board members for those more climate-focused. Since then, the company is reportedly considering announcing its own net zero goals. · Increased transparency demands : The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulatory bodies are developing new reporting rules, based on demands from investors amid confusion due to the current array of voluntary reporting systems. Pavlovsky insists that, among Big Oil and the energy sector players overall, “there is a welcoming and a reception to receiving the additional guidance, to drive the consistency in the reporting…to having a roadmap.” She said these rules would enable more accurate comparisons between companies and industries. · A transformed energy workplace : What does “return to work” look like now in the energy sector? Pavlovsky highlighted that these massive changes converge with “significant advancement in both information technology, as well as operational technologies,… (for example) the pandemic was certainly an accelerator for digital.” These both change the configuration of the energy sector workplace and could smooth the transition to this “new normal” that demands less energy, less fossil fuel and dramatically fewer emissions. “We did see that the industry accelerated its energy transition.” Woman in STEM Christina Morillo for pexels · New needs and new skills create a more diverse workforce : One of the most intriguing things Pavlovsky said in our interview is that the rapid shift to new information, digital and operational technologies expedited by Covid-19 opens job and career opportunities for more diverse populations. “If you look at the challenges ahead of the industry and ESG and,” she said, “and what has been forced through the pandemic, it actually opens up, I think the option to really drive more diversity, and attract more women to the workforce.” She added that, “the combination of the nature of the work and the reskilling, as well as the hybrid model and, and what they open up for women in terms of creating more flexibility.” Now for the hard part though. The pandemic forced the energy sector to address all this low-hanging fruit in their business models and operations to reduce emissions and pivot to the new demands. “We're now getting to a place in the journey where it's getting harder,” Pavlovsky says. But the energy sector can play a crucial role in ESG 2.0. “They also recognize they can be a really significant part of the solution…..(and) can contribute. Whether it's our technological solutions, whether it's the talent that we bring to the market, we actually have a real role in shaping this across industries and sectors globally.” Listen to Joan’s full interview with Kathryn Pavlovsky on Electric Ladies podcast here .",https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/0x0/filters%3Aformat%28jpg%29/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/6175a2ab94c2b393721d73f1/0x0.jpg,forbes,"[('Pavlovsky', 'MEDICINE')]",0.4,0.0,1.0

General manager Brian Gutekunst announced Monday afternoon that the team has placed Adams on the reserve/COVID-19 list. That announcement came just over an hour after coach Matt LaFleur confirmed that Barry had tested positive. LaFleur said that Barry is fully vaccinated and therefore possibly could join the Packers (6-1) for Thursday night’s game if he tested negative Tuesday and Wednesday. “But I’m not going to hold my breath on that,” LaFleur said. LaFleur spoke to reporters before the announcement regarding Adams, who is tied for second in the NFL in catches (73) and is third in yards receiving (744). He did say there were “potentially some other issues with staff.” The reserve/COVID-19 list is for players who either test positive or have close contact with someone who’s infected. LaFleur said the Packers are in advanced protocols and conducted all of Monday’s coaches meetings virtually. LaFleur said all team personnel have to wear masks while in the building, whether or not they’re vaccinated. The Packers are working through which assistant will be responsible for calling defensive plays Thursday if Barry’s unavailable. One candidate could be defensive backs coach Jerry Gray, who has been a defensive coordinator with the Buffalo Bills (2001-05) and Tennessee Titans (2011-13). “I think regardless of how we do it, it’ll be a collective effort with everybody involved and having an input,” LaFleur said. “But certainly you feel confident with a guy like Jerry, who’s called it before and has had a top-five defense in this league.

Now, you have people who want to kick them out of their job over the shot, which is basically a personal decision?” DeSantis argued that those officers who had recovered from Covid-19 should be exempted from the mandate due to the fact that they developed “natural immunity” to the virus. “They’re making no accommodations for that.

PAAlmost five million Brits will get salary rises as Rishi Sunak unfreezes public sector pay and hikes the national minimum wage[/caption] But he will use his Budget this Wednesday to end that pain. And Mr Sunak is expected to hike the minimum wage from £8.91 — with some sources suggesting it could go up to as much as £9.45. That would give the two million or so on rock-bottom figure a £1,000 annual increase for a 35-hour week from next year. The potential five per cent rise comes just weeks after Boris Johnson said Brits deserved to be paid more. And it puts the national minimum wage well on target to hit £10 by the time of the next general election, scheduled for 2024. Currently, Brits aged 23 and over are entitled to be paid a minimum of £8.91 per hour, with a lower sum of £8.36 for 21 and 22-year-olds. Most read in The Sun CHEW ARE YER?

The independent expert body has previously hinted a big rise for 2022 is coming but there is concern in the Treasury about the impact on small businesses. The PM told the Conservative Party conference in Manchester this month: “We are not going back to the same old broken model with low wages, low growth, low skills and low productivity.” And he urged businesses to put up wages. But senior Tories are very aware such a plea would need to be matched by the Government giving support. Shops and hauliers have already been forced to hike wages in an attempt to fill worker shortages. Sainsbury’s and Morrisons are both offering above minimum wage as the supermarkets look to hire thousands of Christmas temps. And aspiring lorry drivers have been offered £1,000 joining bonuses and higher wages as firms struggle with the HGV driver shortfall. Mr Sunk, asked if pay was going up, yesterday said: “We will have to set a new pay policy and that will be a topic for the spending review.” GettyBoris Johnson said: ‘We are not going back to the same old broken model with low wages, low growth, low skills and low productivity’[/caption]",2021-10-24 21:30:00,,,thesun,"[('that pain.', 'MEDICAL ISSUE'), ('8.91', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY'), ('Boris Johnson', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY'), ('Sun CHEW', 'INSURANCE COMPANY NAME'), ('Christmas temps.', 'MEDICAL ISSUE'), ('GettyBoris Johnson', 'INSURANCE COMPANY NAME')]",0.5,0.5,0.5

Supporters of paid sick leave in B.C. advocate from Vancouver and Victoria,https://vancouver.citynews.ca/2021/10/24/vancouver-victoria-paid-sick-leave/,,['alylaube'],,People in Vancouver and Victoria who want B.C. to give workers 10 paid sick days took to the streets Monday to rally for action from the Horgan government.,"A so-called “COVID-safe Day of Action” is taking place Monday in Metro Vancouver and Victoria, with groups hoping to pressure the Horgan government to follow through with its plans to bring in mandatory paid sick leave for workers. Raj Khunkhun, VP with Community Savings Credit Union, says his organization is advocating for 10 paid sick days. “We’re lagging behind comparable countries like New Zealand and Australia. They already introduced 10 paid sick days. Germany actually has 30,” he said. “The federal government is poised to bring in 10 paid sick days for federally regulated workers, so we think B.C. should introduce 10 paid sick days as well.” Related Articles: B.C. seeks input on length of paid sick leave Some B.C. businesses still resistant to paid sick leave: CFIB Health-care workers demand Trudeau fast track paid sick-leave policy The Horgan government is expected to pass legislation before the end of the year to bring in paid sick leave, despite opposition from certain groups — including the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. But Khunkhun says having provincially-mandated paid sick days isn’t going to deter businesses. “We have always provided 12 paid sick days, but we provided a further 10 paid sick days during the pandemic, very early on, and also an additional six hours a week off just to get groceries because the line-ups were long,” said Khunkhun. They found there was no impact to their bottom line and had their most profitable year to-date. “We don’t want people to have to decide between getting paid fully and putting others at risk. We don’t think that should be a burden on the worker. They should also be able to take the time off, and that will also help our healthcare system, which is already really stressed right now,” added Khunkhun.",2021-10-25 00:59:19,,https://vancouver.citynews.ca/wp-content/blogs.dir/sites/9/2021/01/sneeze-1431371.jpg,citynews1130,"[('Canadian Federation of Independent Business.

Authorities around the world have been sounding the alarm as infections surge, with governments in regions where vaccine uptake has been low forced to toughen up restrictions in a bid to stop the virus raging out of control. Russia on Monday reported 37,930 new COVID-19 infections in the last 24 hours, its highest single-day case tally since the start of the pandemic. U.S. to outline Nov. 8 international travel reopening The Biden administration plans to unveil detailed rules on Monday requiring nearly all foreign air visitors to be vaccinated against COVID-19 starting Nov. 8, sources told Reuters. The White House first disclosed on Sept. 20 it would remove restrictions in early November for fully vaccinated air travelers from 33 countries. South Korea plots course to scrapping COVID curbs South Korea unveiled a three-phase strategy to get back to normal from the coronavirus with all limits on gatherings and distancing gone by February, after it achieved a goal of vaccinating 70% of its people at the weekend. The scheme begins next Monday and is due to run until Feb. 20, by when all distancing curbs will be scrapped except for mask-wearing mandates, a government health panel said. Beijing delays marathon, raises COVID curbs as Olympics near China’s latest COVID-19 outbreak has forced the capital Beijing to delay its annual marathon and step up other curbs, as the sprawling city and neighboring Hebei province go into high gear in their preparations for the 2022 Winter Olympics Games. China reported 35 new domestically transmitted cases on Sunday, official data showed on Monday. Beijing accounted for 14 of the 168 cases reported between Oct. 17-24. The infection numbers are tiny compared to many outbreaks elsewhere in the world, but authorities have adopted a zero tolerance strategy, aggressively tracking potential infections. EU regulator starts real-time review of Merck pill U.S. drugmaker Merck & Co Inc said the European Union’s drug regulator has initiated a real-time review of its experimental COVID-19 antiviral drug for adults. Under the procedure, also known as a “rolling review,” the European Medicines Agency would assess data as soon as it becomes available, instead of waiting for a formal application when all required information has been gathered. While vaccines are the main weapons against COVID-19, Merck’s experimental pill molnupiravir could be a game-changer after studies showed it could halve the chances of dying or being hospitalized for those most at risk of contracting severe illness. Pandemic overwhelms Papua New Guinea Concerted international action is needed to support Papua New Guinea as a surge in COVID-19 cases overwhelms the Pacific country’s health system, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said on Monday. Coronavirus cases in the island nation of 9 million have been surging in recent weeks, with 385 new cases recorded on Thursday, according to latest available government data. Fewer than 1% of the population have been fully vaccinated, according to Our World in Data figures. (Compiled by Nick Macfie)",,nationalpost,[],0.0,0.0,1.0
Covid cases ‘to plummet by 85% before Christmas’ even without Plan B clampdown,https://metro.co.uk/2021/10/25/covid-cases-to-plummet-by-85-before-christmas-without-plan-b-clampdown-15480246/,"['UK', 'Boris Johnson', 'Coronavirus', 'Covid vaccine', 'Sajid Javid']",['Emma Brazell'],,New modelling paints a positive picture - despite warnings from experts.,"New modelling paints a positive picture, despite warnings from experts (Picture: Getty Images/PA) Covid cases will plummet to just 5,000 a day by Christmas without ‘Plan B’ restrictions, according to new modelling seen by the Government. Ministers are under fire as daily cases topped 50,000 for the first time since lockdown ended and 223 people died in one day last week. Brits have been urged to get booster jabs to ‘protect the freedom and Christmas that we have all earned’ by the medical director of NHS England. But a model from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine suggests infections will peak in the coming weeks before nosediving over winter, The Telegraph reports. Experts predict cases could fall by 85% before Christmas in other unpublished models, it’s understood. The dramatic decline in infections ‘will happen without’ the introduction of mandatory face masks, vaccine passports and working from home measures. Sage member John Edmunds, a professor in the Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, said: ‘When we were doing the work about two weeks ago, the Health Secretary had made it very clear that the government was not planning to introduce Plan B in the near future ‘Our model was projecting that cases would start to decline some time in the autumn. ‘However, the model also suggests that cases may start to climb again in the spring, due to a combination of waning immunity and increased contacts.’ Cases in schools are believed to be driving the current coronavirus wave, but top scientists believe this will wane as children’s immunity builds. More than 50,000 daily covid cases were recorded for the first time since 17 July on Thursday (Picture: PA) However, the modelling comes as other experts caution vaccines are not enough to stop Covid. Professor Adam Finn, who is on the Joint Committee of Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), has warned against complacency amid the ‘worsening situation in the NHS’. He told Sky News: ‘The vaccines principally are very effective at stopping people from getting seriously ill. ‘They’re not so effective unfortunately at stopping infections altogether or stopping the virus from being spread about. ‘They do have an effect on that, but they’re not by themselves going to be enough at the present time to keep the spread of the virus under control. ‘And we do need to see people continuing to make efforts to avoid contact, to avoid transmission, and to do other things as well as get vaccinated if we’re going to stop this rise from going up further.’ He added: ‘Just giving more people vaccines, including people who maybe don’t actually need the vaccines yet, could actually run the risk of making things worse rather than better. ‘If you boost people before they actually need the vaccine, it is in some senses a waste of vaccine, but also it means that you are immunising them earlier and they may make a smaller response to the vaccine and that response may wear off earlier. ‘So I think the idea of just getting more doses indiscriminately into people’s arms is not really necessarily going to solve the problem.’ Health Secretary Sajid Javid is said to have set up a ‘war room’ where he is holding daily meetings on how to tackle the crisis. Labour has called for Plan B to be imposed immediately, with Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves claiming the vaccine programme is ‘stalling’. The Government is likely to introduce mandatory jabs for NHS staff to protect the vulnerable, despite warnings of legal challenges. Mr Javid said a final decision had not been taken yet ‘but it is something that I’m heading towards’. He told Times Radio: ‘We’ve been very clear and open about this, working with our friends in the NHS, and the reason for this is if you’re working in the NHS, that fantastic work you’re doing every day, you yourself are more susceptible to this virus because you’re just much more likely to come into contact with it, but also the people that you’re looking after are more vulnerable and that’s why they’re in hospital, they’ve got health needs, and this is about protecting them and protecting yourself.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.

I, for one, am NOT. Lewy touts Nagelsmann (Bundesliga.com) Bayern Munich star striker Robert Lewandowski admired the way that Julian Nagelsmann handled himself when first joining the club — and was astounded at how well the new coach understood his roster. “Not much has changed for me as a striker. Of course, you can’t do much new in terms of tactics in modern football, but a new coach, Julian, with his ideas and his path, we quickly understood what he wanted. When you play at the top level, you know what it means to play with a new line-up or system. It’s nothing new,” Lewandowski said. “Of course, it’s important that the coach says exactly what he wants from us or what he expects - and that is exactly what happened. He said straight away what he’s expecting, what direction we want to go in. We all understood that quickly, wanted to go along with it and just do our thing.” While Nagelsmann might be out for the time being with COVID-19, his presence has still been felt as he has been in constant communication with the players and staff.

As a reminder, he should check this out: Loving the moves, @Manuel_Neuer! #MiaSanMia #FCBayern pic.twitter.com/UYO8glPgEP— FC Bayern English (@FCBayernEN) October 24, 2021 ICYMI: The Weekend Warm-up Podcast — Season 1, Episode 22 (Bavarian Football Works) Another week is in the books and Bayern Munich made it exciting as always. The Bavarians crushed both Bayer Leverkusen (Bundesliga) and Benfica (Champions League), lost Alphonso Davies to a minor injury, saw Leon Goretzka get sick, and found out Julian Nagelsmann tested positive for COVID-19. So, yeah, some things definitely went down. Here is what we have on tap for this episode: A quick recap of the Leverkusen and Benfica matches — and what it all means. The transfer rumors linking Chelsea FC’s Antonio Rüdiger and Fiorentina’s Dusan Vlahovic to Bayern Munich. A glance at Robert Lewandowski’s future. A quick look at the upcoming slate of games that Bayern Munich will face — potentially without Julian Nagelsmann. Barca wants Olmo badly (Transfer Market Web) FC Barcelona reportedly wants RB Leipzig attacker Dani Olmo in a bad way, but might not have the finances to make a deal happen: The world of football has already echoed that Dani Olmo, Leipzig’s attacking midfielder, is one of the great objectives of FC Barcelona, who wants to take him in the winter market. However, the arrival of the Spanish could be complicated in the face of the winter market, since Leipzig considers him an essential player and would like to have him until the end of the season. Joan Laporta wants to get hold of him at all costs, as he has shown this summer with offers that have reached 75 million euros between fixed and variable. Despite this, let’s not forget that the current situation of the Barça club continues to be precarious and that leaves them in a complicated position. Apparently, RB Leipzig would be willing to consider offers for 60 million euros during the winter market and FC Barcelona is not the only one who has Dani Olmo in their sights, as there are several teams behind him. For what it is worth, it would be absurd if Olmo and Borussia Dortmund stud Erling Haaland both “sold” (Haaland has a release clause) for the same price next summer. Schalke to keep Terodde (Sport1) Schalke 04 feels good about it’s chances to keep Simon Terodde next season: Simon Terodde will most likely stay with the Royal Blues in the next season. Rouven Schröder is optimistic that he will be able to keep the record scorer of the 2nd Bundesliga in Gelsenkirchen in the coming year. “We have made arrangements that Simon will stay with us. That looks good, ”said the sports director of S04 on the future of the 33-year-old. Simon Terodde has long since achieved cult status, especially among fans of the 2nd Bundesliga. In Germany’s second-highest division, the striker scored 153 goals in 263 games for a total of seven clubs, including Union Berlin, VfB Stuttgart and Hamburger SV. ICYMI: Bavarian Podcast Works Flagship Show — (Bavarian Football Works) Another week has gone by, and there’s even more Bayern Munich news to talk about. Of course the big one is how Joshua Kimmich was revealed to be unvaccinated, creating a massive rift in the Bayern fanbase. We can’t dedicate a whole podcast to that, but we did discuss it and a whole lot of other topics relevant to the club and German football at large. In this episode, Samrin and Ineednoname discuss: Why El Clasico has lost its luster, and you should watch the Bundesliga instead. Why German fans don’t seem to hate each other like Real Madrid and Barcelona fans do. How the Bundesliga is marketed in India now, with ACTUAL PUNDITRY! Room to improve the marketing, especially in comparison to the Premier League. Samrin bullies INNN into remembering three Bielefeld/Mainz players. The Champions League disaster from Germany in Europe. A Haaland vs Lewandowski debate! How Thomas Muller fits Bayern like a glove. Joshua Kimmich’s vaccine decision (final third of the podcast). Witsel drawing interest from Juve, Real Betis (Transfer Market Web) Borussia Dortmund midfielder Axel Witsel is said to be drawing interest from both Juventus and Real Betis: With his contract with Borussia Dortmund expiring at the end of the season, Axel Witsel, midfielder born in 1989 of the Belgian national team, would not be an exclusive idea of ​​Juventus to reinforce their midfielder department at low cost. According to rumors coming from Spain, and reported by Fichajes.net, Real Betis would also have fallen on the player, who would like to sign Witsel on a free transfer in view of next season. Dembele to be Newcastle’s first big splash? (Sport1) Could Ousmane Dembele be ready to make the jump to England? If so, Newcastle United might be ready to hand him some stacks: It could be a great transfer: As reported by several English media, Newcastle United is dealing with the signing of Barcelona star Ousmane Dembélé. According to information from Spox and Goal, the attacker might not be averse to a change. The 24-year-old’s contract expires next summer, and talks about an extension have stalled, not least because of the disastrous financial situation at FC Barcelona. If the world champion and his club do not come to an agreement, the offensive player can negotiate freely with other clubs from January. A situation that the Magpies want to take advantage of, because Dembele could earn a lot of money there: around 15 million euros annual salary are in the room, about five million more than at FC Barcelona. Although there should also be an inaugural bonus of 15 million euros in the room, given the transfer free of charge, this should not be a serious problem for the second-bottom of the Premier League. For FC Barcelona, ​​on the other hand, the Dembélé personality could ultimately prove to be a million dollar grave: the Catalans invested a proud 135 million euros in the wing runabout in the summer of 2017. But in four years, the 2018 world champion only scored 30 goals in 118 games across all competitions and missed 96 games due to injury. ICYMI: Bavarian Podcast Works Postgame Show — Bayern 4, Hoffenheim 0 (Bavarian Football Works) Bayern Munich danced their way past Hoffenheim in a fantastic performance; the game was over by the end of the first half as Serge Gnabry and Robert Lewandowski had scored by that time to give Bayern a 2-0 lead. Gnabry has been having a very productive season to date, scoring at a high rate. Lewandowski’s was a screamer which came courtesy of Thomas Müller outmuscling Chris Richards off the ball and setting up the Polish striker. In the second half, goals from substitutes Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting and Kingsley Coman wrapped up the performance. Choupo-Moting is a deft finisher and tends to always scores these days when he comes on a sub. Coman’s goal was beautifully set up by Dayot Upamecano with a long range pass from the back.",2021-10-25 04:00:01,"Lewy touts Nagelsmann (Bundesliga.com) Bayern Munich star striker Robert Lewandowski admired the way that Julian Nagelsmann handled himself when first joining the club — and was astounded at how well the new coach understood his roster. “Not much has changed for me as a striker.

We all understood that quickly, wanted to go along with it and just do our thing.” While Nagelsmann might be out for the time being with COVID-19, his presence has still been felt as he has been in constant communication with the players and staff.

Barca wants Olmo badly (Transfer Market Web) FC Barcelona reportedly wants RB Leipzig attacker Dani Olmo in a bad way, but might not have the finances to make a deal happen: The world of football has already echoed that Dani Olmo, Leipzig’s attacking midfielder, is one of the great objectives of FC Barcelona, who wants to take him in the winter market. However, the arrival of the Spanish could be complicated in the face of the winter market, since Leipzig considers him an essential player and would like to have him until the end of the season. Joan Laporta wants to get hold of him at all costs, as he has shown this summer with offers that have reached 75 million euros between fixed and variable. Despite this, let’s not forget that the current situation of the Barça club continues to be precarious and that leaves them in a complicated position. Apparently, RB Leipzig would be willing to consider offers for 60 million euros during the winter market and FC Barcelona is not the only one who has Dani Olmo in their sights, as there are several teams behind him. For what it is worth, it would be absurd if Olmo and Borussia Dortmund stud Erling Haaland both “sold” (Haaland has a release clause) for the same price next summer. Related Report: Bayern Munich wants RB Leipzig’s Dani Olmo Schalke to keep Terodde (Sport1) Schalke 04 feels good about it’s chances to keep Simon Terodde next season: Simon Terodde will most likely stay with the Royal Blues in the next season. Rouven Schröder is optimistic that he will be able to keep the record scorer of the 2nd Bundesliga in Gelsenkirchen in the coming year. “We have made arrangements that Simon will stay with us. That looks good, ”said the sports director of S04 on the future of the 33-year-old. Simon Terodde has long since achieved cult status, especially among fans of the 2nd Bundesliga. In Germany’s second-highest division, the striker scored 153 goals in 263 games for a total of seven clubs, including Union Berlin, VfB Stuttgart and Hamburger SV.

Witsel drawing interest from Juve, Real Betis (Transfer Market Web) Borussia Dortmund midfielder Axel Witsel is said to be drawing interest from both Juventus and Real Betis: With his contract with Borussia Dortmund expiring at the end of the season, Axel Witsel, midfielder born in 1989 of the Belgian national team, would not be an exclusive idea of ​​Juventus to reinforce their midfielder department at low cost. According to rumors coming from Spain, and reported by Fichajes . net , Real Betis would also have fallen on the player, who would like to sign Witsel on a free transfer in view of next season. Related Borussia Dortmund roasted in German media for alleged veteran flops Dembele to be Newcastle’s first big splash? (Sport1) Could Ousmane Dembele be ready to make the jump to England? If so, Newcastle United might be ready to hand him some stacks: It could be a great transfer: As reported by several English media, Newcastle United is dealing with the signing of Barcelona star Ousmane Dembélé. According to information from Spox and Goal , the attacker might not be averse to a change. The 24-year-old’s contract expires next summer, and talks about an extension have stalled, not least because of the disastrous financial situation at FC Barcelona. If the world champion and his club do not come to an agreement, the offensive player can negotiate freely with other clubs from January. A situation that the Magpies want to take advantage of, because Dembele could earn a lot of money there: around 15 million euros annual salary are in the room, about five million more than at FC Barcelona. Although there should also be an inaugural bonus of 15 million euros in the room, given the transfer free of charge, this should not be a serious problem for the second-bottom of the Premier League. For FC Barcelona, ​​on the other hand, the Dembélé personality could ultimately prove to be a million dollar grave: the Catalans invested a proud 135 million euros in the wing runabout in the summer of 2017. But in four years, the 2018 world champion only scored 30 goals in 118 games across all competitions and missed 96 games due to injury.

Gnabry has been having a very productive season to date, scoring at a high rate. Lewandowski’s was a screamer which came courtesy of Thomas Müller outmuscling Chris Richards off the ball and setting up the Polish striker. In the second half, goals from substitutes Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting and Kingsley Coman wrapped up the performance. Choupo-Moting is a deft finisher and tends to always scores these days when he comes on a sub. Coman’s goal was beautifully set up by Dayot Upamecano with a long range pass from the back.

It was one of the first nations to successfully issue lock-downs, pursue contact tracing, and develop a robust federal infrastructure dedicated towards fighting the spread of the disease. However, this year has been challenging for the country, especially as the infamous Delta variant became more prevalent. India is home to nearly 1.4 billion people. Amidst the immense population, bustling economy, and deeply rooted cultural paradigms that define the nation, there is also a relative respect for health, science, and self-betterment. That is, India has always been an epicenter for healthcare innovation and holistic medicine, in addition to being the modern day mecca for the world’s pharmaceutical needs . But India’s latest milestone is something for the history books: achieving 1 billion vaccinations in less than a year. This means that nearly 75% of the population has received at least one dose of the vaccine, providing incredible hope for the future of the country’s fight against the pandemic. For sake of comparison, in the USA, 66.6% of the population has currently received atleast one dose, and in Canada, 77% of the population has received atleast one dose.

(Photo by Dibyangshu SARKAR / AFP) (Photo by DIBYANGSHU SARKAR/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images But this is an especially monumental feat for India. One of the foremost problems that the nation continues to face is an incredibly large population— an issue which often creates challenges that other countries may take for granted, such as vaccine distribution.

This is why a feat such as achieving 1 billion vaccinations cannot be taken for granted in a place like India—it simply isn’t the same as achieving the same percentage in the USA, or Canada. There are a far different set of intricate nuances to consider. Understanding these nuances brings forth a renewed appreciation for the achievement. Overall, the milestone also perfectly encapsulates India’s dual interests. While cultural norms and deeply historic roots are pervasive throughout Indian culture, there is also a strong commitment towards innovation, science, and preservation of health. India is home to some of the most advanced healthcare innovation, research and development, and medical technologies in the world. It’s the world’s largest vaccine producer (even prior to Covid), and has forged incredible pathways into robotics, telemedicine, and preventative care. And perhaps most importantly with regards to modern healthcare, the government is committed to embracing cutting-edge digital health strategies . Overall, India is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to research and development on multiple fronts, but especially with regards to science and innovation. Time will tell what will happen in the coming months and years with regards to the Covid-19 Coronavirus pandemic. India, like every other country, is not immune to the constant ebbs-and-flows of the virus; just when case counts start to drop, new variants emerge or new outbreaks occur, sending entire countries back into surge protocols. However, with the information that the world has on hand currently, and based on the current knowledge-base and recommendations provided by public health officials, this milestone marks a promising effort by India in its fight against the virus.",https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/0x0/filters%3Aformat%28jpg%29/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/6175b4e21d27fa82b64d1796/0x0.jpg,forbes,[],0.4,0.0,0.8

Blak...,"NEW YORK (AP) — Andrew Mangiapane scored twice and the Calgary Flames beat the New York Rangers 5-1 on Monday night for their third straight win. Blake Coleman and Mikael Backlund each had a goal and an assist, and Christopher Tanev also scored for Calgary. Johnny Gaudreau got his seventh assist of the season and Jacob Markstrom stopped 28 shots. Dryden Hunt scored for the Rangers, who had won four straight — all on the road. Igor Shesterkin, making his fifth start, finished with 32 saves. Trailing 2-0 after 40 minutes, the Rangers got on the scoreboard early in the third period. Markstrom stopped the initial shot by Jacob Trouba, but Hunt corralled a rebound in front and put it past the goalie for his first of the season at 5:25. Coleman restored Calgary’s two-goal lead less than three minutes later as he backhanded the rebound of his own shot past Shesterkin for his second. Backlund made it 4-1 with 8 1/2 minutes left as he scored into the top left corner from the right circle for his first. Mangiapane got his second of the night, scoring on a rebound on the power play from the right side with just over five seconds remaining. It was his fifth of the season and 10th in his last nine games, dating to last season. Leading 1-0 after one period, the Flames doubled their lead early in the second. Mangiapane intercepted a pass by Patrik Nemeth from behind the Rangers net and beat Shesterkin from the right side at 2:09. Mika Zibanejad had a chance to get the Rangers on the scoreboard after a Flames turnover as he skated up the ice with Alexis Lafreniere, but was denied by Markstorm with about 6 1/2 minutes left in the middle period. Shesterkin made a nice glove stop on a slap shot by Tyler Pitlick about 40 seconds later. Markstrom stopped a wraparound try by Trouba with just more than two minutes to go, and then denied his backhand follow. Calgary outshot New York 15-7 in the first period. Shesterkin’s best save of the period came on an attempt by Sean Monahan in front with 3:15 remaining after a giveaway by the goalie. Tanev got the Flames on the scoreboard on a rush with 1:10 left in the opening period as he got a pass from Gaudreau and beat Shesterkin from the right circle on the glove side for his first of the season. Elias Lindholm got his first assist and seventh point on the play. The Rangers were down two players for much of the first. Rugged forward Ryan Reaves went to the dressing room early in the period after an apparent injury to his left leg, and defenseman Ryan Lindgren joined him by the midpoint after blocking a shot with his foot. Lindgren was back on the bench late in the period, and returned to the ice in the second. Reaves was also on the bench at the start of the second, but did not play again. SPECIAL TEAMS The Rangers went 0 for 2 on the power play and are 3 for 26 this season. … The Flames were 1 for 2 with the man advantage, improving to 3 for 14. LINEUPS Ryan Strome returned to the Rangers’ lineup after missing the four-game road trip due to COVID-19 protocols. He started on a line with Artemi Panarin and Barclay Goodrow. Morgan Barron was sent to Hartford of the AHL to make room for Strome. Injured forward Kappo Kakko is still out and coach Gerard Gallant said Kakko could return Friday.

Cherwoo, The Associated Press",2021-10-26 02:11:48,"NEW YORK (AP) — Andrew Mangiapane scored twice and the Calgary Flames beat the New York Rangers 5-1 on Monday night for their third straight win. Blake Coleman and Mikael Backlund each had a goal and an assist, and Christopher Tanev also scored for Calgary. Johnny Gaudreau got his seventh assist of the season and Jacob Markstrom stopped 28 shots. Dryden Hunt scored for the Rangers, who had won four straight — all on the road. Igor Shesterkin, making his fifth start, finished with 32 saves. Trailing 2-0 after 40 minutes, the Rangers got on the scoreboard early in the third period. Markstrom stopped the initial shot by Jacob Trouba, but Hunt corralled a rebound in front and put it past the goalie for his first of the season at 5:25. Coleman restored Calgary’s two-goal lead less than three minutes later as he backhanded the rebound of his own shot past Shesterkin for his second. Backlund made it 4-1 with 8 1/2 minutes left as he scored into the top left corner from the right circle for his first. Mangiapane got his second of the night, scoring on a rebound on the power play from the right side with just over five seconds remaining. It was his fifth of the season and 10th in his last nine games, dating to last season. Leading 1-0 after one period, the Flames doubled their lead early in the second. Mangiapane intercepted a pass by Patrik Nemeth from behind the Rangers net and beat Shesterkin from the right side at 2:09. Mika Zibanejad had a chance to get the Rangers on the scoreboard after a Flames turnover as he skated up the ice with Alexis Lafreniere, but was denied by Markstorm with about 6 1/2 minutes left in the middle period. Shesterkin made a nice glove stop on a slap shot by Tyler Pitlick about 40 seconds later. Markstrom stopped a wraparound try by Trouba with just more than two minutes to go, and then denied his backhand follow. Calgary outshot New York 15-7 in the first period. Shesterkin’s best save of the period came on an attempt by Sean Monahan in front with 3:15 remaining after a giveaway by the goalie. Tanev got the Flames on the scoreboard on a rush with 1:10 left in the opening period as he got a pass from Gaudreau and beat Shesterkin from the right circle on the glove side for his first of the season. Elias Lindholm got his first assist and seventh point on the play. The Rangers were down two players for much of the first. Rugged forward Ryan Reaves went to the dressing room early in the period after an apparent injury to his left leg, and defenseman Ryan Lindgren joined him by the midpoint after blocking a shot with his foot. Lindgren was back on the bench late in the period, and returned to the ice in the second. Reaves was also on the bench at the start of the second, but did not play again. SPECIAL TEAMS The Rangers went 0 for 2 on the power play and are 3 for 26 this season. … The Flames were 1 for 2 with the man advantage, improving to 3 for 14. LINEUPS Ryan Strome returned to the Rangers’ lineup after missing the four-game road trip due to COVID-19 protocols. He started on a line with Artemi Panarin and Barclay Goodrow. Morgan Barron was sent to Hartford of the AHL to make room for Strome. Injured forward Kappo Kakko is still out and coach Gerard Gallant said Kakko could return Friday. Julian Gauthier was also back in the lineup, and Greg McKegg was scratched. With the exception of Markstrom, the Flames used the same lineup as Saturday against Washington.

Pac-12 men’s basketball preview: Can league capitalize on record-setting NCAA Tournament performances?,https://www.deseret.com/2021/10/25/22732726/pac-12-basketball-preview-utah-utes-coach-craig-smith-commissioner-george-kliavkoff-jamie-zaninovich,,['Jay Drew'],,,"UCLA players celebrate after an Elite 8 game against Michigan at Lucas Oil Stadium, Wednesday, March 31, 2021, in Indianapolis. UCLA won 51-49. With all their key contributors returning this season, the Bruins are sure to be a tough out for the Utes and the other Pac-12 teams this season. | Darron Cummings, Associated Press New Runnin’ Utes coach Craig Smith enters a Pac-12 basketball race that is as deep and loaded as ever after impressive NCAA Tournament showing in 2021 SAN FRANCISCO — A razor-close overtime loss to undefeated Gonzaga in a Final Four game. Three teams in the Elite Eight. Four teams in the Sweet 16. Five teams in the Round of 32. A conference-record 13 total wins in the 2021 NCAA Tournament. Add it all up, and it begs the question: What will Pac-12 men’s basketball teams do for an encore in the 2022 Big Dance after the most successful overall showing in conference history last March? “We have great reasons for optimism in the Pac-12,” deputy commissioner and chief operating officer Jamie Zaninovich said at the league’s men’s basketball media day last week at conference headquarters in San Francisco. “The collective commitment to basketball throughout the conference is very important. Our shared objective is to optimize tournament bids and ultimately cut down the nets as national champions.” — Pac-12 commissioner George Kliavkoff The good news for the league is that many of the top players who helped turn the conference’s unexpected success into the story of March Madness last spring are back for more this year. Although only two Pac-12 teams made The Associated Press Top 25 preseason poll released Monday — UCLA is at No. 2 and Oregon is at No. 13 — the league is seemingly gaining more respect with each passing year. Arizona, USC and Colorado received votes, along with BYU, which will play two Pac-12 teams this year — Utah and Oregon. “We are excited about the momentum we have from last season, and confident in the talented student-athletes and great leadership from our coaches,” said new Pac-12 commissioner George Kliavkoff last week. “The collective commitment to basketball throughout the conference is very important. Our shared objective is to optimize tournament bids and ultimately cut down the nets as national champions.” That hasn’t been done since Lute Olson’s Arizona Wildcats won it all in 1997. Into that momentum, and improvement after some lackluster Big Dance showings from 2017-2019, steps new University of Utah coach Craig Smith. The only other new coach is Arizona’s Tommy Lloyd, the former top assistant under Mark Few at Gonzaga. “Certainly, being a part of this amazing conference — the Pac-12, the Conference of Champions, is what they say. Or at least somebody does. To be a part of that is awesome. It is something you want to be a part of, right?,” Smith said, flanked by returnees Branden Carlson and Riley Battin, when it was Utah’s turn to address the media on Oct. 13. “Bring on the competition.” Actually, the league has been trending up since 2020, when up to six teams were expected to get NCAA Tournament bids before the Big Dance was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But few saw the 2021 success coming. In retrospect, every team was probably under-seeded, from Final Four participant UCLA — which upset BYU in a first-round game — to surprise conference tournament champion Oregon State to USC, Colorado and Oregon (which was eliminated by another Pac-12 school, USC). “To finally see the Pac-12 in men’s basketball capture the attention of the basketball world, in March Madness, is truly remarkable and again, a testament to our student-athletes, coaches, administrators, everybody,” Zaninovich said. Some of the league’s NCAA Tournament failures in past years, or unimpressive showings in nonconference games, have been explained away by league officials as the conference having too many one-and-done players leaving early for the NBA. That didn’t happen this offseason, as preseason all-conference selections Johnny Juzang of UCLA, Warith Alatishe of Oregon State, Marcus Bagley of Arizona State and Isaiah Mobley of USC opted to return, “when they had pro opportunities in front of them, but chose to come back to school and invest in their collegiate experience,” Zaninovich said. As it were, the league produced three NBA lottery picks in 2021 — more than any other conference. Four all-freshman team players returned, and will be joined by 10 all-conference transfers, including MAC Player of the Year Marreon Jackson, the former Toledo star who is moving on to Arizona State. Zaninovich said four McDonald’s All-Americans will join the Pac-12 this year, and 12 players from ESPN’s Top 100 recruits list. Smith and Lloyd join a group of coaches who have more than 3,000 wins and 148 years of coaching experience. “The coaching in this league is obviously remarkable,” Zaninovich said. What else does the 2021-22 season hold for the Pac-12? Officials announced that the Pac-12 championship game at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas will tip off in prime time on the East Coast and will be televised by Fox. Also, the Pac-12 will host an NCAA Regional at the Chase Center in San Francisco — the first time in 80 years that San Francisco will host an NCAA Tournament game, the last one having been played at nearby Treasure Island. This will be the second season in which Pac-12 schools will play 20 conference games each. Before that, there will be some huge opportunities for Pac-12 teams to get big national wins. Stanford, Oregon and Arizona State will all get a shot at defending national champion Baylor; Washington and UCLA will play preseason AP No. 1 Gonzaga. Also, Oregon will play in the Maui Invitational and ASU will play in the Battle 4 Atlantis with opportunities to run across top-ranked teams in later rounds. Pac-12 teams will meet power-conference teams at least 20 times, including Utah’s Nov. 20 game against the ACC’s Boston College at the Sunshine Slam in Daytona Beach, Florida. The Runnin’ Utes will also face the SEC’s Missouri on Dec. 18 in Columbia, Missouri, the Big 12’s TCU on Dec. 8 in Fort Worth, Texas, and will host Big 12-bound BYU on Nov. 27 at the Huntsman Center in games that will either add to, or detract from, the league’s improved reputation as a national player. Zaninovich said the league has worked hard to help schools with their nonconference scheduling to figure out what makes the most sense for them. The goal is to have Pac-12 teams win at least 75% of their nonconference games. “We looked at tons of data of the NCAA Tournament, historically, and in most every case, if a conference wins 75% of its nonconference games, at least 50% of their teams advance to the NCAA Tournament,” Zaninovich said. Here’s a closer look at each team’s prospects in 2021-22, in order of how they were selected to finish in the preseason media poll: 1. UCLA Darron Cummings, Associated Press UCLA guard Tyger Campbell, right, celebrates with teammate guard Jaime Jaquez Jr. (4) after an Elite 8 game against Michigan in the NCAA men’s college basketball tournament at Lucas Oil Stadium, in Indianapolis on Wednesday, March 31, 2021. UCLA won 51-49. UCLA is an overwhelming favorite to win the Pac-12 after reaching the Final Four last season. All five starters and every other contributor to the Bruins’ Final Four run returned for coach Mick Cronin, making UCLA an easy pick to win the league. Starters such as Juzang, Tyger Campbell, Jules Bernard, Cody Riley and Jaime Jaquez Jr. will be joined by key newcomers Peyton Watson, Will McClendon and Rutgers transfer Myles Johnson to give the Bruins arguably the best team in the country. “Conference success in our sport is important because of NCAA Tournament bids,” Cronin said at media day. “We are all playing to go to the NCAA Tournament, and getting quality seeds. So conference power, success, all of it, is huge. … I think we proved last year that Pac-12 basketball is powerful.” Juzang and Jaquez said there’s a heightened sense of excitement in Westwood these days, thanks to that tournament run. “We are just as excited as them,” Juzang said. Cronin said the Bruins have “the greatest tradition” in the history of college basketball and feel more pressure to live up to that standard than to repeat last year’s run. 2. Oregon Jeff Roberson, Associated Press Oregon guard Will Richardson drives to the basket ahead of Southern California guard Drew Peterson during Sweet 16 game in the NCAA men’s college basketball tournament at Bankers Life Fieldhouse, Sunday, March 28, 2021, in Indianapolis. Richardson will be back for the Ducks in 2021-22, and is considered one of the better point guards in the league. The Ducks lost quality players Chris Duarte, LJ Figueroa and Eugene Omoruyi, but did well in the transfer portal market, landing Syracuse’s Quincy Guerrier, Oklahoma’s De’Vion Harmon and Jacob Young of Rutgers. They will join one of the Pac-12’s better returning point guards, Will Richardson, to give coach Dana Altman another league championship contender. Former American Fork star Isaac Johnson, a 7-footer, will join the program after having served a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints the past two years. Altman was asked at media day how much longer he will stay in coaching. “I don’t have anything else,” he said. “I am 63. I would like to go on as long as Oregon will have me. … I don’t know what I would do if I didn’t go to the gym every day.” 3. USC (AP Photo/Paul Sancya, Associated Press USC forward Evan Mobley (4) and USC forward Isaiah Mobley (3) watch from the bench during game against Kansas in the second round of the NCAA Tournament at Hinkle Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, Monday, March 22, 2021. While Evan has moved on to the NBA (the No. 3 overall pick in the 2021 NBA draft) Isaiah returns to the Trojans this season. A lot of experts say the Trojans will sorely miss Evan Mobley, the No. 3 pick in July’s NBA draft. They will. But they will also miss reliable guard Tahj Eaddy, the Santa Clara transfer who helped USC eliminate Utah 91-85 in double overtime in the Pac-12 quarterfinals last spring. Coach Andy Enfield does get back Mobley’s brother, Isaiah, and point guard Ethan Anderson and wings Isaiah White and Drew Peterson. Forwards Max Agbonkpolo and Chavez Goodwin also return, which is why USC should make the Big Dance again. “We have a lot of versatilely, but our guards have to be good for us if we hope to get back,” Enfield said.”… The excitement around our program is at an all-time high since I have been here the last eight seasons.” Memphis transfer Boogie Ellis brings his 10.2 scoring average to the team. The coach said the Pac-12’s showing in the tournament “gave our conference a tremendous boost. We were rooting for everyone else as if it were our own program.” T4. Arizona Jeff Chiu, Associated Press Arizona coach Tommy Lloyd waves while speaking during Pac-12 media day Wednesday, Oct. 13, 2021, in San Francisco. Lloyd and Utah’s Craig Smith are the two newcomer coaches to the league this season. Sure, the Wildcats have the winning tradition to fall back on, but this pick from media members who cover the Pac-12 seems high (the Deseret News picked Arizona ninth on its ballot). As mentioned previously, new coach Lloyd saw a lot of winning in more than 20 years at Gonzaga, but Ws don’t figure to come as easily in Tucson for awhile. “I might have to recalibrate what a good winning percentage feels like,” Lloyd said. “I am really looking forward to that journey where every game is going to be a battle.” Lloyd said at Gonzaga if they lost a West Coast Conference game, “it felt like you lost a seed line” for the NCAA Tournament. Bennedict Mathurin, Azuolas Tubelis and Kerr Kriisa stuck around after Sean Miller was fired, and Utah transfer Pelle Larsson should be able to step in and contribute immediately. “We have a great young nucleus to work with,” Lloyd said. T4. Oregon State Amanda Loman, Associated Press Oregon State’s Warith Alatishe shoots over Utah’s Riley Battin during game in Corvallis, Ore., Thursday, Feb. 18, 2021. Much to Oregon State coach Wayne Tinkle’s delight, Alatishe will be back for the Beavers. Before that magical three-weekend stretch in March when they won the Pac-12 Tournament and advanced to the Elite Eight, the Beavers were an average team, perhaps even less than that. Can they recapture that momentum? Coach Wayne Tinkle was able to keep most of his best players — most notably Alatishe, supreme shooter Jarod Lucas and backcourt mate Gianni Hunt. Replacing floor leader Ethan Thompson will be difficult. “This conference is going to be as deep as it has ever been,” Tinkle said, hinting that even though the Beavers have improved, the rest of the league has as well, and duplicating that run will be difficult. 6. Colorado Michael Conroy, Associated Press Colorado forward Evan Battey celebrates during a timeout against Georgetown in NCAA first-round game at Hinkle Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, Saturday, March 20, 2021. Battey will be back for the Buffs in 2021-22. Point guard McKinley Wright IV was a fixture in Boulder the past four years, and will be extremely hard to replace. But coach Tad Boyle said he likes this group, especially if a highly rated incoming freshman class contributes. The Buffs’ best returners are big man Evan Battey, forward Jabari Walker and guard Eli Parquet, who helped CU go 14-6 in league play and earn a No., 5 seed in the NCAA Tournament. Colorado reached the Round of 32 and was the only Pac-12 entrant that didn’t win two or more contests in March Madness. “We are in great shape leadership-wise, but we gotta grow up quickly,” Boyle said. 7. Arizona State Rick Scuteri, Associated Press Arizona State coach Bobby Hurley talks to Marcus Bagley during game against Arizona, Thursday, Jan. 21, 2021, in Tempe, Ariz. Convincing Bagley to return was a big win for the ASU coach. Coach Bobby Hurley scored two major wins in the offseason, getting talented forward Bagley to stick around for at least another year and luring MAC Player of the Year Marreon Jackson of Toledo to Tempe. Jackson, who averaged 18.1 points, 6.1 rebounds and 5.9 assists for the Rockets last year, will team with Ohio State transfer Luther Muhammad and Boston College transfer Jay Heath and returnees Bagley, Kimani Lawrence and Enoch Boakye to give Hurley plenty of talent with which to work. After ASU went 11-14 last year, 7-10 in the Pac-12, Hurley said watching fellow conference mates succeed in the tournament was invigorating. “I was so happy for the league, and for those colleagues, those coaches,” he said. Bagley, a 6-foot-8 sophomore, said his decision to return was “based on knowing how much better I could be.” 8. Washington State Pete Caster, Associated Press Washington State head coach Kyle Smith reacts after a foul was called during game against Stanford, Saturday, Feb. 20, 2021, in Pullman, Wash. Slowly but surely, Smith is bringing respectability to the Cougars program. The Cougars are a popular pick among some to make the NCAA Tournament for the first time in awhile, because coach Kyle Smith is slowly building something in Pullman. Wazzu returns its main rotation — led by Efe Abogidi, Dishon Jackson and Noah Williams — and should be bolstered by South Alabama transfer Michael Flowers (21.0 ppg.) and UC San Diego transfer Tyrell Roberts (19.2 ppg.), who joined Abogidi and Smith at media day. “He’s a bucket,” Smith said of the 5-11 Roberts. Having gone 7-12 in league play last year, the Cougars will hang their hat on defense once again, Smith said. “I think our talent is there,” he said. “Experience is still lacking, we are still quite youthful.” 9. Stanford David Zalubowski, Associated Press Stanford forward Jaiden Delaire, left, drives during game against Colorado Saturday, Jan. 16, 2021, in Boulder, Colo. Delaire will be among the Cardinal players trying to keep Stanford coach Jerod Haase on the sidelines this season. While Utah coach Larry Krystkowiak was clearly on the hot seat last year, and ended up losing his job, the Pac-12 coach who wears that description this year is Stanford’s Jerod Haase, along with Washington’s Mike Hopkins, perhaps. The Cardinal lost a lot, most notably Oscar da Silva, Zaire Williams and Daejon Davis, and will do well to make the tournament for the first time since 2014. Senior Jaiden Delaire, junior Spencer Jones and five-star recruit Harrison Ingram will attempt to help Haase keep his job. “Our goal is to simple — it is to be awesome,” Haase said. That might be what it takes to keep the sixth-year coach in Palo Alto for another year. 10. Utah Jeff Chiu, Associated Press Utah coach Craig Smith, left, speaks next to Riley Battin, middle, and Branden Carlson during Pac-12 media day Wednesday, Oct. 13, 2021, in San Francisco. While expectations for the Utes are not high in Smith’s first year at the helm, the players said at media day that the Utes will surprise some people in 2021-22. For the record, the Deseret News picked the Utes to finish seventh. The mass exodus since Krystkowiak was fired on March 16 has been well-documented, but Smith was able to keep Carlson and Battin in the fold (after Battin briefly entered the transfer portal) and those two said at media day that the Runnin’ Utes will surprise some people in 2021-22. “I will say this: We have gotten a lot better in a short amount of time, and I can’t wait to see where this team goes,” Smith said at media day. The feeling here is that UNLV grad transfer David Jenkins Jr. will give the Utes a nice scoring lift, and Utah State transfers Marco Anthony and Rollie Worster will add some defensive toughness that was lacking last year. “There is a lot of depth in our backcourt,” Smith said. “The words that describe our backcourt are selfless and skilled. They can shoot it, they can pass it, they can dribble it, and for the most part we are pretty tough defensively with a good feel for the game.” 11. Washington Ted S. Warren, Associated Press California guard Jarred Hyder (3) is defended by Washington forward Nate Roberts (1) as guards Jamal Bey (5) and Marcus Tsohonis (0) watch during game Saturday, Feb. 20, 2021, in Seattle. The Huskies went 15-3 in Pac-12 play in 2018-19, but have been a disaster since then, going 9-29 in league play since. The aforementioned Hopkins seemingly needs a big turnaround to keep his job. Starters Jamal Bey and Nate Roberts return, but most of the other expected contributors are transfers — guys such as Terrell Brown Jr. (Arizona), Daejon Davis (Stanford) and Emmitt Mathews Jr. (West Virginia). “We took advantage of the transfer portal,” Hopkins said. 12. California Jeff Chiu, Associated Press California forward Andre Kelly shoots against Oregon during game in Berkeley, Calif., Saturday, Feb. 27, 2021. Kelly is the Bears’ leading returning scorer. Coach Mark Fox’s best player last year, former Wasatch Academy star Matt Bradley, has transferred to San Diego State. He will be missed. Andre Kelly (10.3 ppg.) and Grant Anticevich (8.9 ppg.) are back, and are joined by Charlotte transfer Jordan Shepherd. The Bears will play at UNLV on Nov. 13 in what should be a barometer game; they will also play Florida in the Rocket Mortgage Fort Myers Tip-Off and either Ohio State or Seton Hall in the second round. “We have a nonconference schedule that is going to help us play in the best conference in America,” Fox said.",2021-10-25 16:15:22,"SAN FRANCISCO — A razor-close overtime loss to undefeated Gonzaga in a Final Four game. Three teams in the Elite Eight. Four teams in the Sweet 16. Five teams in the Round of 32. A conference-record 13 total wins in the 2021 NCAA Tournament. Add it all up, and it begs the question: What will Pac-12 men’s basketball teams do for an encore in the 2022 Big Dance after the most successful overall showing in conference history last March? “We have great reasons for optimism in the Pac-12,” deputy commissioner and chief operating officer Jamie Zaninovich said at the league’s men’s basketball media day last week at conference headquarters in San Francisco. “The collective commitment to basketball throughout the conference is very important.

Jeff Roberson, Associated Press The Ducks lost quality players Chris Duarte, LJ Figueroa and Eugene Omoruyi, but did well in the transfer portal market, landing Syracuse’s Quincy Guerrier, Oklahoma’s De’Vion Harmon and Jacob Young of Rutgers. They will join one of the Pac-12’s better returning point guards, Will Richardson, to give coach Dana Altman another league championship contender. Former American Fork star Isaac Johnson , a 7-footer, will join the program after having served a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints the past two years. Altman was asked at media day how much longer he will stay in coaching. “I don’t have anything else,” he said. “I am 63. I would like to go on as long as Oregon will have me. … I don’t know what I would do if I didn’t go to the gym every day.” 3. USC USC forward Evan Mobley (4) and USC forward Isaiah Mobley (3) watch from the bench during game against Kansas in the second round of the NCAA Tournament at Hinkle Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, Monday, March 22, 2021. While Evan has moved on to the NBA (the No. 3 overall pick in the 2021 NBA draft) Isaiah returns to the Trojans this season. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya, Associated Press A lot of experts say the Trojans will sorely miss Evan Mobley, the No. 3 pick in July’s NBA draft. They will. But they will also miss reliable guard Tahj Eaddy, the Santa Clara transfer who helped USC eliminate Utah 91-85 in double overtime in the Pac-12 quarterfinals last spring. Coach Andy Enfield does get back Mobley’s brother, Isaiah, and point guard Ethan Anderson and wings Isaiah White and Drew Peterson. Forwards Max Agbonkpolo and Chavez Goodwin also return, which is why USC should make the Big Dance again. “We have a lot of versatilely, but our guards have to be good for us if we hope to get back,” Enfield said.”… The excitement around our program is at an all-time high since I have been here the last eight seasons.” Memphis transfer Boogie Ellis brings his 10.2 scoring average to the team. The coach said the Pac-12’s showing in the tournament “gave our conference a tremendous boost. We were rooting for everyone else as if it were our own program.” T4. Arizona Arizona coach Tommy Lloyd waves while speaking during Pac-12 media day Wednesday, Oct. 13, 2021, in San Francisco. Lloyd and Utah’s Craig Smith are the two newcomer coaches to the league this season. Jeff Chiu, Associated Press Sure, the Wildcats have the winning tradition to fall back on, but this pick from media members who cover the Pac-12 seems high (the Deseret News picked Arizona ninth on its ballot). As mentioned previously, new coach Lloyd saw a lot of winning in more than 20 years at Gonzaga, but Ws don’t figure to come as easily in Tucson for awhile. “I might have to recalibrate what a good winning percentage feels like,” Lloyd said. “I am really looking forward to that journey where every game is going to be a battle.” Lloyd said at Gonzaga if they lost a West Coast Conference game, “it felt like you lost a seed line” for the NCAA Tournament. Bennedict Mathurin, Azuolas Tubelis and Kerr Kriisa stuck around after Sean Miller was fired, and Utah transfer Pelle Larsson should be able to step in and contribute immediately. “We have a great young nucleus to work with,” Lloyd said. T4. Oregon State Oregon State’s Warith Alatishe shoots over Utah’s Riley Battin during game in Corvallis, Ore., Thursday, Feb. 18, 2021. Much to Oregon State coach Wayne Tinkle’s delight, Alatishe will be back for the Beavers. Amanda Loman, Associated Press Before that magical three-weekend stretch in March when they won the Pac-12 Tournament and advanced to the Elite Eight, the Beavers were an average team, perhaps even less than that. Can they recapture that momentum? Coach Wayne Tinkle was able to keep most of his best players — most notably Alatishe, supreme shooter Jarod Lucas and backcourt mate Gianni Hunt. Replacing floor leader Ethan Thompson will be difficult. “This conference is going to be as deep as it has ever been,” Tinkle said, hinting that even though the Beavers have improved, the rest of the league has as well, and duplicating that run will be difficult. 6. Colorado Colorado forward Evan Battey celebrates during a timeout against Georgetown in NCAA first-round game at Hinkle Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, Saturday, March 20, 2021. Battey will be back for the Buffs in 2021-22. Michael Conroy, Associated Press Point guard McKinley Wright IV was a fixture in Boulder the past four years, and will be extremely hard to replace. But coach Tad Boyle said he likes this group, especially if a highly rated incoming freshman class contributes. The Buffs’ best returners are big man Evan Battey, forward Jabari Walker and guard Eli Parquet, who helped CU go 14-6 in league play and earn a No., 5 seed in the NCAA Tournament. Colorado reached the Round of 32 and was the only Pac-12 entrant that didn’t win two or more contests in March Madness. “We are in great shape leadership-wise, but we gotta grow up quickly,” Boyle said. 7. Arizona State Arizona State coach Bobby Hurley talks to Marcus Bagley during game against Arizona, Thursday, Jan. 21, 2021, in Tempe, Ariz. Convincing Bagley to return was a big win for the ASU coach. Rick Scuteri, Associated Press Coach Bobby Hurley scored two major wins in the offseason, getting talented forward Bagley to stick around for at least another year and luring MAC Player of the Year Marreon Jackson of Toledo to Tempe. Jackson, who averaged 18.1 points, 6.1 rebounds and 5.9 assists for the Rockets last year, will team with Ohio State transfer Luther Muhammad and Boston College transfer Jay Heath and returnees Bagley, Kimani Lawrence and Enoch Boakye to give Hurley plenty of talent with which to work. After ASU went 11-14 last year, 7-10 in the Pac-12, Hurley said watching fellow conference mates succeed in the tournament was invigorating. “I was so happy for the league, and for those colleagues, those coaches,” he said. Bagley, a 6-foot-8 sophomore, said his decision to return was “based on knowing how much better I could be.” 8. Washington State Washington State head coach Kyle Smith reacts after a foul was called during game against Stanford, Saturday, Feb. 20, 2021, in Pullman, Wash. Slowly but surely, Smith is bringing respectability to the Cougars program. Pete Caster, Associated Press The Cougars are a popular pick among some to make the NCAA Tournament for the first time in awhile, because coach Kyle Smith is slowly building something in Pullman. Wazzu returns its main rotation — led by Efe Abogidi, Dishon Jackson and Noah Williams — and should be bolstered by South Alabama transfer Michael Flowers (21.0 ppg.) and UC San Diego transfer Tyrell Roberts (19.2 ppg.), who joined Abogidi and Smith at media day. “He’s a bucket,” Smith said of the 5-11 Roberts. Having gone 7-12 in league play last year, the Cougars will hang their hat on defense once again, Smith said. “I think our talent is there,” he said. “Experience is still lacking, we are still quite youthful.” 9. Stanford Stanford forward Jaiden Delaire, left, drives during game against Colorado Saturday, Jan. 16, 2021, in Boulder, Colo. Delaire will be among the Cardinal players trying to keep Stanford coach Jerod Haase on the sidelines this season. David Zalubowski, Associated Press While Utah coach Larry Krystkowiak was clearly on the hot seat last year, and ended up losing his job, the Pac-12 coach who wears that description this year is Stanford’s Jerod Haase, along with Washington’s Mike Hopkins, perhaps. The Cardinal lost a lot, most notably Oscar da Silva, Zaire Williams and Daejon Davis, and will do well to make the tournament for the first time since 2014. Senior Jaiden Delaire, junior Spencer Jones and five-star recruit Harrison Ingram will attempt to help Haase keep his job. “Our goal is to simple — it is to be awesome,” Haase said. That might be what it takes to keep the sixth-year coach in Palo Alto for another year. 10. Utah Utah coach Craig Smith, left, speaks next to Riley Battin, middle, and Branden Carlson during Pac-12 media day Wednesday, Oct. 13, 2021, in San Francisco. While expectations for the Utes are not high in Smith’s first year at the helm, the players said at media day that the Utes will surprise some people in 2021-22. Jeff Chiu, Associated Press For the record, the Deseret News picked the Utes to finish seventh. The mass exodus since Krystkowiak was fired on March 16 has been well-documented, but Smith was able to keep Carlson and Battin in the fold (after Battin briefly entered the transfer portal) and those two said at media day that the Runnin’ Utes will surprise some people in 2021-22. “I will say this: We have gotten a lot better in a short amount of time, and I can’t wait to see where this team goes,” Smith said at media day. The feeling here is that UNLV grad transfer David Jenkins Jr. will give the Utes a nice scoring lift, and Utah State transfers Marco Anthony and Rollie Worster will add some defensive toughness that was lacking last year. “There is a lot of depth in our backcourt,” Smith said. “The words that describe our backcourt are selfless and skilled. They can shoot it, they can pass it, they can dribble it, and for the most part we are pretty tough defensively with a good feel for the game.” 11. Washington California guard Jarred Hyder (3) is defended by Washington forward Nate Roberts (1) as guards Jamal Bey (5) and Marcus Tsohonis (0) watch during game Saturday, Feb. 20, 2021, in Seattle. Ted S. Warren, Associated Press The Huskies went 15-3 in Pac-12 play in 2018-19, but have been a disaster since then, going 9-29 in league play since. The aforementioned Hopkins seemingly needs a big turnaround to keep his job. Starters Jamal Bey and Nate Roberts return, but most of the other expected contributors are transfers — guys such as Terrell Brown Jr. (Arizona), Daejon Davis (Stanford) and Emmitt Mathews Jr. (West Virginia). “We took advantage of the transfer portal,” Hopkins said. 12. California California forward Andre Kelly shoots against Oregon during game in Berkeley, Calif., Saturday, Feb. 27, 2021. Kelly is the Bears’ leading returning scorer. Jeff Chiu, Associated Press Coach Mark Fox’s best player last year, former Wasatch Academy star Matt Bradley, has transferred to San Diego State. He will be missed. Andre Kelly (10.3 ppg.) and Grant Anticevich (8.9 ppg.) are back, and are joined by Charlotte transfer Jordan Shepherd. The Bears will play at UNLV on Nov. 13 in what should be a barometer game; they will also play Florida in the Rocket Mortgage Fort Myers Tip-Off and either Ohio State or Seton Hall in the second round. “We have a nonconference schedule that is going to help us play in the best conference in America,” Fox said.

(AP Photo/Anupam Nath) | ASSOCIATED PRESS The mortality caused by a deadly pathogen is partly a reflection of the social and political order it attacks Never in our lifetimes, it seems, has there been greater uncertainty about the future — and greater ignorance of the past. At the beginning of 2020, very few people grasped the significance of the news coming out of Wuhan about a new coronavirus. When I first spoke and wrote publicly about the rising probability of a global pandemic, in the week ending Jan. 26, 2020, I was regarded as eccentric (certainly by the majority of the delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos, who seemed oblivious to the danger). The conventional wisdom at that time, from Fox News to The Washington Post, was that the coronavirus posed a lesser threat to Americans than the usual winter wave of influenza. On Feb. 2, I wrote, “We are now dealing with an epidemic in the world’s most populous country, which has a significant chance of becoming a global pandemic. ... The challenge is ... to resist that strange fatalism that leads most of us not to cancel our travel plans and not to wear uncomfortable masks, even when a dangerous virus is spreading exponentially.” Looking back, I read those sentences as a veiled confession. I was traveling manically in January and February, as I had done for most of the previous 20 years. In January, I flew from London to Dallas, from Dallas to San Francisco, and from there to Hong Kong (Jan. 8), Taipei (Jan. 10), Singapore (Jan. 13), Zurich (Jan. 19), back to San Francisco (Jan. 24), and then to Fort Lauderdale (Jan. 27). I wore a mask once or twice but found it intolerable after an hour and took it off. In the course of February, I flew almost as frequently, though not so far: to New York, Sun Valley, Bozeman, Washington and Lyford Cay in the Bahamas. You may wonder what kind of life that was. I used to joke that the lecture circuit had turned me into an “international man of history.” I realized only later that I might have been one of the “superspreaders” whose hyperactive travel schedules were spreading the virus from Asia to the rest of the world. My weekly newspaper column in the first half of 2020 became a kind of plague diary, though I never mentioned the fact that I was ill for most of February, with a painful cough I could not shake off. (To get through lectures, I relied heavily on the alternative medicine that some call Scotch.) “Worry about grandparents,” I wrote on Feb. 29; “the mortality rate for people in their eighties is above 14%, whereas it’s close to zero for those under 40.” I omitted the less comforting data on asthmatic men in their mid-50s. I also left out the fact that I went to see a doctor twice only to be told that — as more or less everywhere in the United States at that time — there were no tests available for COVID-19. All I knew was that it was serious, and not only for me and my family. As I wrote on March 1: “Those who blithely say, ‘This is no worse than the flu’ ... are missing the point. ... Uncertainty surrounds it because it is so difficult to detect in its early stages, when many carriers are both infectious and asymptomatic. We don’t know for sure how many people have it, so we don’t exactly know its reproduction number and its mortality rate. There’s no vaccine and there’s no cure.” In another article, published in The Wall Street Journal on March 8, I wrote, “If the U.S. turns out to have proportionately as many cases as South Korea, it will soon have some 46,000 cases and more than 300 deaths — or 1,200 deaths if the U.S. mortality rate is as high as Italy’s.” At that point, total confirmed cases in the U.S. stood at just 541; deaths at 22. We passed 46,000 cases on March 24 and 1,200 deaths on March 25, just over two weeks later. On March 15, I noted, “John F. Kennedy airport was thronged yesterday with people doing what, since time immemorial, they have done in times of plague: fleeing the big city (and spreading the virus). ... We are entering the panic phase of the pandemic.” That was the same day I myself flew, with my wife and my two youngest children, from California to Montana. We stayed there for a year. I wrote and thought about little else in the first half of 2020. Why this intense preoccupation? The answer is that, although my core competency is financial history, I have been keenly interested in the role of disease in history ever since studying the Hamburg cholera epidemic of 1892 as a graduate student more than 30 years ago. Richard Evans’ meticulously detailed study of that episode introduced me to the idea that the mortality caused by a deadly pathogen is partly a reflection of the social and political order it attacks. It was the class structure as much as the bacterium Vibrio cholerae that killed people in Hamburg, Germany, Evans argued, because the entrenched power of the city’s property owners had been an insuperable obstacle to improving the city’s antiquated water and sewage systems. The mortality rate for the poor was 13 times higher than for the rich. Researching “The Pity of War” a few years later, I was struck by statistics that suggested the German army had collapsed in 1918 partly because of a surge of illness, possibly resulting from the Spanish influenza pandemic. “The War of the World” (Penguin, 2006) delved more deeply into the history of the 1918-19 pandemic, showing how the First World War ended with twin pandemics — not only influenza but also the ideological contagion of Bolshevism. The work I did on empires in the 2000s also involved excursions into the history of contagious disease. No account of European settlement in the New World could have omitted the role that disease played in “thinning the Indians, to make room for the English,” as John Archdale, the governor of Carolina in the 1690s, callously remarked. (The title of the second chapter of my book “Empire” was “White Plague.”) I was also very struck by the terrible toll of tropical disease on British soldiers stationed far from home: A man’s chances of surviving a tour of duty in Sierra Leone were pitifully low — 1 in 2. “The Great Degeneration” (Penguin, 2014) explicitly warned of our growing vulnerability to “the ... random mutation of viruses like influenza,” while “The Square and the Tower” (Penguin, 2017) was essentially a history of the world based on the insight that “network structures are as important as viruses in determining the speed and extent of a contagion.” The COVID-19 pandemic is far from over. The death toll worldwide approaches five million, which is certainly an underestimate, as the statistics from a number of large countries (notably Iran and Russia) cannot be trusted. And the cumulative body count continues to rise globally — to say nothing of the number of people whose health has been permanently damaged, which no one has yet estimated. It seems increasingly likely that Lord Martin Rees, Britain’s astronomer royal, has won his bet with the Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker that “bioterror or bioerror will lead to one million casualties in a single event within a six month period starting no later than Dec 31 2020.” Some epidemiologists have argued that, without drastic social distancing and economic lockdowns, the ultimate death toll could have been between 30 million and 40 million. Because of government restrictions and changes in public behavior, it will surely not be as high. ASSOCIATED PRESS Cemetery workers lower the coffin of a COVID-19 victim into his grave at the Vila Formosa cemetery in Sao Paulo, Brazil, late Wednesday, March 31, 2021. Because of the increased number of deaths in the city, the burial service in some public cemeteries has been extended to the hours of the night. (AP Photo/Nelson Antoine) Yet precisely these “nonpharmaceutical interventions” have inflicted a shock on the world economy far greater than that caused by the 2008-09 financial crisis — potentially as great as the shock of the Great Depression, but compressed into months, not years. Governments had to take drastic fiscal measures to stave off a collapse of the markets. You see, disasters and their impact are rarely entirely exogenous events, with the exception of a massive meteor strike, which hasn’t happened in 66 million years, or an alien invasion, which hasn’t happened at all. Even a catastrophic earthquake is only as catastrophic as the extent of urbanization along the fault line — or the shoreline, if it triggers a tsunami. A pandemic is made up of a new pathogen and the social networks that it attacks. We cannot understand the scale of the contagion by studying only the virus itself, because the virus will infect only as many people as social networks allow it to. At the same time, a catastrophe lays bare the societies and states that it strikes. It is a moment of truth, of revelation, exposing some as fragile, others as resilient, and others as “antifragile” — able not just to withstand disaster but to be strengthened by it. We still find ourselves in the middle of this pandemic, about which it’s hard to gain the perspective that hindsight affords. But looking at past pandemics and disasters not only helps provide perspective on the current one, but also allow us to understand and prepare for the inevitability of the next one. So cometh now My Lady Influenza, like a star Inebriously wan, and in her train Fever, the haggard soul’s white nenuphur, And lily-fingered Death, and grisly Pain And Constipation who makes all things vain, Pneumonyer, Cancer, and Nasal Catarrh. Rupert Brooke’s “To My Lady Influenza” (1906) was a facetious undergraduate work. Yet “Lady Influenza” was never to be trifled with. The first well-described influenza outbreaks were in 16th-century Europe, but the earliest was probably in 1173. There had been significant influenza pandemics in the 18th and 19th centuries, but the 20th century was to be hit much harder. A more populous world was also a more urban world and a more mobile world — a world in which low air quality in industrial towns may have made people more susceptible to respiratory illnesses. A year after Brooke wrote “To My Lady Influenza,” his eldest brother, Dick, died of pneumonia at the age of 26. Brooke himself would live only a year longer, dying of an infected mosquito bite that led to sepsis, off the Greek island of Skyros. A predictable “gray rhino,” in the sense that danger of a general European war was well known, but also a surprising “black swan,” in the sense that contemporaries seemed bewildered by its outbreak, the First World War was a true dragon-king event in terms of its vast historical consequences. As disastrous as the war was, its proximate impact in terms of lives lost was exceeded by that of the influenza pandemic that broke out in its final year. Where exactly the new strain of H1N1 first appeared is uncertain, but it is usually said to have been Fort Riley, Kansas, the site of Camp Funston, one of the network of Army camps where hundreds of thousands of young American men were being trained to fight in Europe as the American Expeditionary Forces. There is, however, evidence that the pandemic originated in the British Army in 1917, though the condition was initially identified as “purulent bronchitis with bronchopneumonia.” Here was the key to influenza’s 20th-century success. Never had armies been mobilized on such a scale before — more than 70 million men in uniform. Never had so many young men been taken from their homes and workplaces, crowded into primitive accommodations, and sent over long distances in ships and trains. The idea that the virus originated in pigs has been refuted (an avian origin seems more likely); if anything, the direction of infection was from men to pigs. The first American cases were recorded at Camp Funston on March 4. A week later, a member of Fort Riley’s catering staff entered the infirmary, followed in the coming days by a stream of infected soldiers. By the end of the month, more than a thousand cases had been recorded and 48 men had died of influenza. As if to mock the efforts of men to kill one another, the virus spread rapidly across the United States and then crossed to Europe on the jam-packed American troopships. It is possible that the pandemic explains the near doubling of the proportion of German soldiers reporting sick in the summer of 1918, which was a crucial factor in the imperial army’s subsequent collapse. Certainly, we have reports of German prisoners of war with the flu from July. By that time it had reached India, Australia and New Zealand. A few months later, a second and deadlier wave struck all but simultaneously in Brest, France; Freetown, Sierra Leone; and Boston. The virus made a new landfall in the United States at Boston’s Commonwealth Pier on Aug. 27, 1918, when three cases of influenza appeared on the sick list. Eight cases emerged the next day, and 58 the next, 15 of whom were so ill they were transferred to the U.S. Naval Hospital in Chelsea. On Sept. 8, influenza arrived at the Army’s Camp Devens. Within 10 days, thousands of feverish patients overwhelmed the camp’s hospitals; within weeks, the morgue was full of blue-tinged, asphyxiated corpses. Combatant countries sought to suppress the news of the pandemic as potentially harmful to wartime morale; this hardly helped to keep the public informed. The disease came to be known as the Spanish flu because only the largely uncensored press of neutral Spain reported on it with any accuracy. Between 40 million and 50 million people died as a result of the pandemic, the majority of them suffocated by a lethal accumulation of blood and other fluid in the lungs. The absolute numbers were highest in India (18.5 million deaths) and China (between 4 million and 9.5 million), but death rates varied widely from place to place. Close to half (44.5%) of the population of Cameroon was wiped out; in Western Samoa, nearly a quarter (23.6%). The worst mortality rates in Europe were in Hungary and Spain (each around 1.2%), with Italy not far behind. By contrast, North America got off lightly: between 0.53% and 0.65% for the United States, 0.61% for Canada. As these figures imply, the Spanish flu was indifferent as to a country’s combatant status. While its initial spread may have been related to wartime accommodation and transportation, that soon ceased to be true. In the United States, the deaths of as many as 675,000 people were attributed to the Spanish flu, of which 550,000 were excess deaths (above what would have been expected in that period under normal circumstances). Equivalent mortality in 2020 would have been between 1.8 million and 2.2 million Americans. The Spanish flu killed an order of magnitude more Americans than died in combat in the war (53,402). Ironically, unlike most flu epidemics, but like the war that preceded and spread it, the influenza of 1918 disproportionately killed young adults. Out of 272,500 male influenza deaths in the United States, nearly 49% were aged 20 to 39, whereas only 18% were under five and 13% were over 50. The very young and very old were also (as usual) vulnerable, so that all countries for which age-specific death rates are available recorded a roughly W-shaped age distribution of mortality. Death was not caused by the influenza virus itself so much as by the body’s immunological reaction to the virus. Perversely, this meant that individuals with the strongest immune systems were more likely to die than those with weaker immune systems. A good illustration of the impact of the pandemic on young adults, as well as a vivid description of the hallucinogenic miseries of the illness itself, can be found in Katherine Anne Porter’s short story “Pale Horse, Pale Rider” (1937), about a wartime romance cut cruelly short by the virus. In Sept. 2021, COVID-19’s American death toll overtook that of the 1918 flu. And yet, in Aug. 2020, it appeared that, with a regime of mass testing, contact tracing, social distancing and targeted quarantining, a country could contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2, as the virus relied heavily on superspreaders for its transmission and disproportionately sickened or killed people past retirement age. Only in the spring of 2021 did it join the elite of pandemics — the 20 or so in recorded history that killed upward of 0.05% of humanity. Only a handful of those nations that fought World War II have lost more people per day to COVID-19 than they have lost to the Axis powers. The United States is one of those countries. This illustrates something profound — that all disasters are at some level man-made political disasters, even if they originate with new pathogens. Politics explained why World War II killed 25 times as many Germans as Americans. Politics also helps to explain why COVID-19 has thus far killed more than eight times as many Americans as Germans. ASSOCIATED PRESS The fiancee of a person who died of COVID-19 breaks down during cremation in Gauhati, India, Tuesday, April 27, 2021. Coronavirus cases in India are surging faster than anywhere else in the world. (AP Photo/Anupam Nath) This plague began as a gray rhino, predicted by many. It struck as a black swan, somehow completely unforeseen. Could it become a world-changing “dragon king”? As we have seen, disasters of any kind become truly epoch-making events only if their economic, social and political ramifications amount to more than the excess mortality they cause. Could this medium-size disaster nevertheless alter our lives permanently and profoundly? Let me now hazard three guesses. First, COVID-19 will be to social life what AIDS was to sexual life: It will change our behavior, though by no means enough to avert a significant number of premature deaths. I myself welcome a new age of social distancing, but then I am a natural misanthrope who hates crowds and will not greatly miss hugs and handshakes. Most people, however, will be unable to resist the temptations of post-lockdown gregariousness. There will be unsafe socializing just as there still is unsafe sex, even after more than three decades and 30 million deaths from HIV. Second, and for that reason, most big cities are not “over.” Do we all now head from Gotham or the Great Wen to the villages, there to cultivate our vegetable gardens in splendid, rustic isolation? Do nearly half of us continue to work from home, as we did during the pandemic — more than three times more than before? Probably not. It takes a lot to kill a city. True, just over a century after Thomas Mann wrote “Death in Venice” (1912), Venice is pretty much dead. But it was not cholera that killed it — it was the shifting pattern of international trade. Likewise, COVID-19 will not kill London or New York; it will just make them cheaper, grungier and younger. Some billionaires will not return. Some firms and many families will move to the suburbs or even farther afield. Tax revenues will drop. Crime rates will jump. As Gerald Ford supposedly did in 1975, when the city asked for a federal bailout, another president may tell New York to “drop dead.” San Francisco will lose talent to Austin. But inertia is a powerful thing. Americans these days relocate less than they used to. Only a third of jobs can really be done at home; everyone else will still need to work in offices, shops and factories. Workplaces will just be different — more spacious and campus-like, as they already are in Silicon Valley. Commuting will no longer involve being packed like sardines on a subway. No more unwelcome intimacies on elevators. Masks over most faces. No more tut-tutting at the hijab and the niqab. Perforce, we are all modest now. What of the pandemic’s impact on the generational imbalances that had grown so intolerable in many societies by 2020? Was COVID-19 sent by Freya, the goddess of youth, to emancipate millennials and Generation Z from bearing the fiscal burden of an excessive number of elderly people? It is tempting to marvel at this ageist virus. No previous pandemic was so discriminating against the elderly and in favor of the young. But in truth, the impact of COVID-19 in terms of excess mortality will probably not be great enough to balance the intergenerational accounts. In the short run, the majority of old people will remain retired; relatively few will die prematurely — hardly any in the most elderly of countries, Japan. The young, meanwhile, will be the ones struggling to find jobs (other than with Amazon) and struggling almost as much to have fun. An economy without crowds is not a “new normal.” It may be more like the new anomie, to borrow Émile Durkheim’s term for the sense of disconnectedness he associated with modernity. For most young people, the word “fun” is almost synonymous with “crowd.” The era of distancing will be a time of depression in the psychological as well as the economic sense. The gloom has been especially deep for Generation Z, whose university social lives — half the point of college, if not more — were wrecked. They spent yet more time on electronic devices — perhaps an hour a day more than before the pandemic. It did not make them happier.

At the beginning of 2020, very few people grasped the significance of the news coming out of Wuhan about a new coronavirus. When I first spoke and wrote publicly about the rising probability of a global pandemic, in the week ending Jan. 26, 2020, I was regarded as eccentric (certainly by the majority of the delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos, who seemed oblivious to the danger). The conventional wisdom at that time, from Fox News to The Washington Post, was that the coronavirus posed a lesser threat to Americans than the usual winter wave of influenza. On Feb. 2, I wrote, “We are now dealing with an epidemic in the world’s most populous country, which has a significant chance of becoming a global pandemic. ... The challenge is ... to resist that strange fatalism that leads most of us not to cancel our travel plans and not to wear uncomfortable masks, even when a dangerous virus is spreading exponentially.” Looking back, I read those sentences as a veiled confession. Related Is there hope for the family after the pandemic? Or will the battle of the sexes rage on? The river is round I was traveling manically in January and February, as I had done for most of the previous 20 years. In January, I flew from London to Dallas, from Dallas to San Francisco, and from there to Hong Kong (Jan. 8), Taipei (Jan. 10), Singapore (Jan. 13), Zurich (Jan. 19), back to San Francisco (Jan. 24), and then to Fort Lauderdale (Jan. 27). I wore a mask once or twice but found it intolerable after an hour and took it off. In the course of February, I flew almost as frequently, though not so far: to New York, Sun Valley, Bozeman, Washington and Lyford Cay in the Bahamas. You may wonder what kind of life that was. I used to joke that the lecture circuit had turned me into an “international man of history.” I realized only later that I might have been one of the “superspreaders” whose hyperactive travel schedules were spreading the virus from Asia to the rest of the world. My weekly newspaper column in the first half of 2020 became a kind of plague diary, though I never mentioned the fact that I was ill for most of February, with a painful cough I could not shake off. (To get through lectures, I relied heavily on the alternative medicine that some call Scotch.) “Worry about grandparents,” I wrote on Feb. 29; “the mortality rate for people in their eighties is above 14%, whereas it’s close to zero for those under 40.” I omitted the less comforting data on asthmatic men in their mid-50s. I also left out the fact that I went to see a doctor twice only to be told that — as more or less everywhere in the United States at that time — there were no tests available for COVID-19. All I knew was that it was serious, and not only for me and my family. As I wrote on March 1: “Those who blithely say, ‘This is no worse than the flu’ ... are missing the point. ... Uncertainty surrounds it because it is so difficult to detect in its early stages, when many carriers are both infectious and asymptomatic. We don’t know for sure how many people have it, so we don’t exactly know its reproduction number and its mortality rate. There’s no vaccine and there’s no cure.” In another article, published in The Wall Street Journal on March 8, I wrote, “If the U.S. turns out to have proportionately as many cases as South Korea, it will soon have some 46,000 cases and more than 300 deaths — or 1,200 deaths if the U.S. mortality rate is as high as Italy’s.” At that point, total confirmed cases in the U.S. stood at just 541; deaths at 22. We passed 46,000 cases on March 24 and 1,200 deaths on March 25, just over two weeks later. On March 15, I noted, “John F. Kennedy airport was thronged yesterday with people doing what, since time immemorial, they have done in times of plague: fleeing the big city (and spreading the virus). ... We are entering the panic phase of the pandemic.” That was the same day I myself flew, with my wife and my two youngest children, from California to Montana. We stayed there for a year. I wrote and thought about little else in the first half of 2020. Why this intense preoccupation? The answer is that, although my core competency is financial history, I have been keenly interested in the role of disease in history ever since studying the Hamburg cholera epidemic of 1892 as a graduate student more than 30 years ago. Richard Evans’ meticulously detailed study of that episode introduced me to the idea that the mortality caused by a deadly pathogen is partly a reflection of the social and political order it attacks. It was the class structure as much as the bacterium Vibrio cholerae that killed people in Hamburg, Germany, Evans argued, because the entrenched power of the city’s property owners had been an insuperable obstacle to improving the city’s antiquated water and sewage systems. The mortality rate for the poor was 13 times higher than for the rich. Researching “The Pity of War” a few years later, I was struck by statistics that suggested the German army had collapsed in 1918 partly because of a surge of illness, possibly resulting from the Spanish influenza pandemic. “The War of the World” (Penguin, 2006) delved more deeply into the history of the 1918-19 pandemic, showing how the First World War ended with twin pandemics — not only influenza but also the ideological contagion of Bolshevism. The work I did on empires in the 2000s also involved excursions into the history of contagious disease. No account of European settlement in the New World could have omitted the role that disease played in “thinning the Indians , to make room for the English , ” as John Archdale, the governor of Carolina in the 1690s, callously remarked. (The title of the second chapter of my book “Empire” was “White Plague.”) I was also very struck by the terrible toll of tropical disease on British soldiers stationed far from home: A man’s chances of surviving a tour of duty in Sierra Leone were pitifully low — 1 in 2. “ The Great Degeneration” (Penguin, 2014) explicitly warned of our growing vulnerability to “the ... random mutation of viruses like influenza,” while “The Square and the Tower” (Penguin, 2017) was essentially a history of the world based on the insight that “network structures are as important as viruses in determining the speed and extent of a contagion.” The COVID-19 pandemic is far from over. The death toll worldwide approaches five million, which is certainly an underestimate, as the statistics from a number of large countries (notably Iran and Russia) cannot be trusted. And the cumulative body count continues to rise globally — to say nothing of the number of people whose health has been permanently damaged, which no one has yet estimated. It seems increasingly likely that Lord Martin Rees, Britain’s astronomer royal, has won his bet with the Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker that “bioterror or bioerror will lead to one million casualties in a single event within a six month period starting no later than Dec 31 2020.” Some epidemiologists have argued that, without drastic social distancing and economic lockdowns, the ultimate death toll could have been between 30 million and 40 million. Because of government restrictions and changes in public behavior, it will surely not be as high. Cemetery workers lower the coffin of a COVID-19 victim into his grave at the Vila Formosa cemetery in Sao Paulo, Brazil, late Wednesday, March 31, 2021. Because of the increased number of deaths in the city, the burial service in some public cemeteries has been extended to the hours of the night. (AP Photo/Nelson Antoine) ASSOCIATED PRESS Yet precisely these “nonpharmaceutical interventions” have inflicted a shock on the world economy far greater than that caused by the 2008-09 financial crisis — potentially as great as the shock of the Great Depression, but compressed into months, not years. Governments had to take drastic fiscal measures to stave off a collapse of the markets. You see, disasters and their impact are rarely entirely exogenous events, with the exception of a massive meteor strike, which hasn’t happened in 66 million years, or an alien invasion, which hasn’t happened at all. Even a catastrophic earthquake is only as catastrophic as the extent of urbanization along the fault line — or the shoreline, if it triggers a tsunami. A pandemic is made up of a new pathogen and the social networks that it attacks. We cannot understand the scale of the contagion by studying only the virus itself, because the virus will infect only as many people as social networks allow it to. At the same time, a catastrophe lays bare the societies and states that it strikes. It is a moment of truth, of revelation, exposing some as fragile, others as resilient, and others as “antifragile” — able not just to withstand disaster but to be strengthened by it. We still find ourselves in the middle of this pandemic, about which it’s hard to gain the perspective that hindsight affords. But looking at past pandemics and disasters not only helps provide perspective on the current one, but also allow us to understand and prepare for the inevitability of the next one. So cometh now My Lady Influenza, like a star Inebriously wan, and in her train Fever, the haggard soul’s white nenuphur, And lily-fingered Death, and grisly Pain And Constipation who makes all things vain, Pneumonyer, Cancer, and Nasal Catarrh. Rupert Brooke’s “To My Lady Influenza” (1906) was a facetious undergraduate work. Yet “Lady Influenza” was never to be trifled with. The first well-described influenza outbreaks were in 16th-century Europe, but the earliest was probably in 1173. There had been significant influenza pandemics in the 18th and 19th centuries, but the 20th century was to be hit much harder. A more populous world was also a more urban world and a more mobile world — a world in which low air quality in industrial towns may have made people more susceptible to respiratory illnesses. A year after Brooke wrote “To My Lady Influenza,” his eldest brother, Dick, died of pneumonia at the age of 26. Brooke himself would live only a year longer, dying of an infected mosquito bite that led to sepsis, off the Greek island of Skyros. A predictable “gray rhino,” in the sense that danger of a general European war was well known, but also a surprising “black swan,” in the sense that contemporaries seemed bewildered by its outbreak, the First World War was a true dragon-king event in terms of its vast historical consequences. As disastrous as the war was, its proximate impact in terms of lives lost was exceeded by that of the influenza pandemic that broke out in its final year. Where exactly the new strain of H1N1 first appeared is uncertain, but it is usually said to have been Fort Riley, Kansas, the site of Camp Funston, one of the network of Army camps where hundreds of thousands of young American men were being trained to fight in Europe as the American Expeditionary Forces. There is, however, evidence that the pandemic originated in the British Army in 1917, though the condition was initially identified as “purulent bronchitis with bronchopneumonia.” Here was the key to influenza’s 20th-century success. Never had armies been mobilized on such a scale before — more than 70 million men in uniform. Never had so many young men been taken from their homes and workplaces, crowded into primitive accommodations, and sent over long distances in ships and trains. The idea that the virus originated in pigs has been refuted (an avian origin seems more likely); if anything, the direction of infection was from men to pigs. The first American cases were recorded at Camp Funston on March 4. A week later, a member of Fort Riley’s catering staff entered the infirmary, followed in the coming days by a stream of infected soldiers. By the end of the month, more than a thousand cases had been recorded and 48 men had died of influenza. As if to mock the efforts of men to kill one another, the virus spread rapidly across the United States and then crossed to Europe on the jam-packed American troopships. It is possible that the pandemic explains the near doubling of the proportion of German soldiers reporting sick in the summer of 1918, which was a crucial factor in the imperial army’s subsequent collapse. Certainly, we have reports of German prisoners of war with the flu from July. By that time it had reached India, Australia and New Zealand. A few months later, a second and deadlier wave struck all but simultaneously in Brest, France; Freetown, Sierra Leone; and Boston. The virus made a new landfall in the United States at Boston’s Commonwealth Pier on Aug. 27, 1918, when three cases of influenza appeared on the sick list. Eight cases emerged the next day, and 58 the next, 15 of whom were so ill they were transferred to the U.S. Naval Hospital in Chelsea. On Sept. 8, influenza arrived at the Army’s Camp Devens. Within 10 days, thousands of feverish patients overwhelmed the camp’s hospitals; within weeks, the morgue was full of blue-tinged, asphyxiated corpses. Combatant countries sought to suppress the news of the pandemic as potentially harmful to wartime morale; this hardly helped to keep the public informed. The disease came to be known as the Spanish flu because only the largely uncensored press of neutral Spain reported on it with any accuracy. Between 40 million and 50 million people died as a result of the pandemic, the majority of them suffocated by a lethal accumulation of blood and other fluid in the lungs. The absolute numbers were highest in India (18.5 million deaths) and China (between 4 million and 9.5 million), but death rates varied widely from place to place. Close to half (44.5%) of the population of Cameroon was wiped out; in Western Samoa, nearly a quarter (23.6%). The worst mortality rates in Europe were in Hungary and Spain (each around 1.2%), with Italy not far behind. By contrast, North America got off lightly: between 0.53% and 0.65% for the United States, 0.61% for Canada. As these figures imply, the Spanish flu was indifferent as to a country’s combatant status. While its initial spread may have been related to wartime accommodation and transportation, that soon ceased to be true. In the United States, the deaths of as many as 675,000 people were attributed to the Spanish flu, of which 550,000 were excess deaths (above what would have been expected in that period under normal circumstances). Equivalent mortality in 2020 would have been between 1.8 million and 2.2 million Americans. The Spanish flu killed an order of magnitude more Americans than died in combat in the war (53,402). Ironically, unlike most flu epidemics, but like the war that preceded and spread it, the influenza of 1918 disproportionately killed young adults. Out of 272,500 male influenza deaths in the United States, nearly 49% were aged 20 to 39, whereas only 18% were under five and 13% were over 50. The very young and very old were also (as usual) vulnerable, so that all countries for which age-specific death rates are available recorded a roughly W-shaped age distribution of mortality. Death was not caused by the influenza virus itself so much as by the body’s immunological reaction to the virus. Perversely, this meant that individuals with the strongest immune systems were more likely to die than those with weaker immune systems. A good illustration of the impact of the pandemic on young adults, as well as a vivid description of the hallucinogenic miseries of the illness itself, can be found in Katherine Anne Porter’s short story “Pale Horse, Pale Rider” (1937), about a wartime romance cut cruelly short by the virus. In Sept. 2021, COVID-19’s American death toll overtook that of the 1918 flu. And yet, in Aug. 2020, it appeared that, with a regime of mass testing, contact tracing, social distancing and targeted quarantining, a country could contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2, as the virus relied heavily on superspreaders for its transmission and disproportionately sickened or killed people past retirement age. Only in the spring of 2021 did it join the elite of pandemics — the 20 or so in recorded history that killed upward of 0.05% of humanity. Only a handful of those nations that fought World War II have lost more people per day to COVID-19 than they have lost to the Axis powers. The United States is one of those countries. This illustrates something profound — that all disasters are at some level man-made political disasters, even if they originate with new pathogens. Politics explained why World War II killed 25 times as many Germans as Americans. Politics also helps to explain why COVID-19 has thus far killed more than eight times as many Americans as Germans.

(AP Photo/Anupam Nath) ASSOCIATED PRESS This plague began as a gray rhino, predicted by many. It struck as a black swan, somehow completely unforeseen. Could it become a world-changing “dragon king”? As we have seen, disasters of any kind become truly epoch-making events only if their economic, social and political ramifications amount to more than the excess mortality they cause. Could this medium-size disaster nevertheless alter our lives permanently and profoundly? Let me now hazard three guesses. First, COVID-19 will be to social life what AIDS was to sexual life: It will change our behavior, though by no means enough to avert a significant number of premature deaths. I myself welcome a new age of social distancing, but then I am a natural misanthrope who hates crowds and will not greatly miss hugs and handshakes. Most people, however, will be unable to resist the temptations of post-lockdown gregariousness. There will be unsafe socializing just as there still is unsafe sex, even after more than three decades and 30 million deaths from HIV. Second, and for that reason, most big cities are not “over.” Do we all now head from Gotham or the Great Wen to the villages, there to cultivate our vegetable gardens in splendid, rustic isolation? Do nearly half of us continue to work from home, as we did during the pandemic — more than three times more than before? Probably not. It takes a lot to kill a city. True, just over a century after Thomas Mann wrote “Death in Venice” (1912), Venice is pretty much dead. But it was not cholera that killed it — it was the shifting pattern of international trade. Likewise, COVID-19 will not kill London or New York; it will just make them cheaper, grungier and younger. Some billionaires will not return. Some firms and many families will move to the suburbs or even farther afield. Tax revenues will drop. Crime rates will jump. As Gerald Ford supposedly did in 1975, when the city asked for a federal bailout, another president may tell New York to “drop dead.” San Francisco will lose talent to Austin. But inertia is a powerful thing. Americans these days relocate less than they used to. Only a third of jobs can really be done at home; everyone else will still need to work in offices, shops and factories. Workplaces will just be different — more spacious and campus-like, as they already are in Silicon Valley. Commuting will no longer involve being packed like sardines on a subway. No more unwelcome intimacies on elevators. Masks over most faces. No more tut-tutting at the hijab and the niqab. Perforce, we are all modest now. What of the pandemic’s impact on the generational imbalances that had grown so intolerable in many societies by 2020? Was COVID-19 sent by Freya, the goddess of youth, to emancipate millennials and Generation Z from bearing the fiscal burden of an excessive number of elderly people? It is tempting to marvel at this ageist virus. No previous pandemic was so discriminating against the elderly and in favor of the young. But in truth, the impact of COVID-19 in terms of excess mortality will probably not be great enough to balance the intergenerational accounts. In the short run, the majority of old people will remain retired; relatively few will die prematurely — hardly any in the most elderly of countries, Japan. The young, meanwhile, will be the ones struggling to find jobs (other than with Amazon) and struggling almost as much to have fun. An economy without crowds is not a “new normal.” It may be more like the new anomie, to borrow Émile Durkheim’s term for the sense of disconnectedness he associated with modernity.

Student who collapsed on night out ‘terrified’ club spiker will attack again,https://metro.co.uk/2021/10/25/student-who-collapsed-in-club-terrified-that-spiker-may-attack-again-15483303/,"['UK', 'crime', 'Nottingham', 'Priti Patel', 'Theresa May']",['Josh Layton'],,"Sarah Buckle, 19, passed out and began vomiting and choking after being poisoned on a night out in Nottingham.","Sarah Buckle has written to the Home Secretary, Priti Patel, calling for government action to make nightclubs safer for women (Picture: Sarah Buckle/ITV/Getty) The victim of a suspected needle spiking attack is calling on the government to enact measures to protect women on nights out. Sarah Buckle is ‘terrified’ at the thought that the culprit is still on the loose, six weeks after she was hosptalised on a night out. The 19-year-old has approached her constituency MP, Theresa May, and the Home Secretary, Priti Patel, calling for clubs to be made to introduce safety and security precautions to protect guests from injections with needles and substances slipped into drinks. The University of Nottingham student said she collapsed and began choking after falling ill on the night out and is ‘really scared’ that whoever was responsible has not been caught by police. After arriving in the club, which she does want to name, at around 11pm her last memory is meeting some friends at the bar before she was discharged from hospital around 10 hours later. Sarah spoke after an outcry over needles being used to spike women with powerful so-called date rape drugs at nightclubs across the UK. ‘It all came out of nowhere,’ she said. ‘My friends said I stopped talking and I tried typing something on my phone but it wasn’t making sense. I wasn’t able to speak or stand up, so security said to me to leave. ‘My friends got in a taxi with me and at this point I started really violently throwing up. Apparently I started screaming as well and I was going unconscious. I was in and out of this horrible state. In the taxi they called an ambulance to meet us at the house. ‘When the ambulance arrived I was unconscious and choking.’ Sarah’s left hand was throbbing and a mark resembling a pin-prick on the back suggests a needle was used, but she also believes there is a chance her drink could have spiked. ‘However it happened it doesn’t change the fact that women are in danger,’ she said. ‘It’s really important that nightclubs take responsibility to ensure these attacks are less likely to happen and they need to introduce protocols such as mandatory searches, providing bottle stoppers and lid covers and having no CCTV blind spots. ‘Staff also need to be informed what to look out for after and be more sympathetic to the fact that not everyone has had too much to drink. ‘The government needs to make sure it is easier for hospitals and police to communicate, collect and share evidence. I don’t think we’ll ever eradicate these attacks, but we can make them less likely.’ Sarah Buckle says she has suffered anxiety since she was the victim of a spiking incident in a Nottingham club (Picture: Sarah Buckle) In her letter to the MPs, the management student says that in the past few days she has been approached by ‘hundreds of young women who have experienced similar incidents to me, or have recommendations about measures which can be implemented to help prevent further attacks’. The suggestions also include making it mandatory for clubs to scan IDs on entry and exit, recording who was in a venue at a certain time. Although there has been a national outcry and police forces have made a number of arrests, the second year’s case is still being investigated. She told Metro.co.uk that because her tests weren’t taken at an optimal time when the incident occurred on September 28 or in the early hours of the following day, it’s unlikely they will show anything once they have been examined in a laboratory. Sarah Buckle woke up in hospital after a night out with no memory of how she got there and a throbbing pain in her left hand (Picture: ITV) A night out with friends turned into an ordeal for Sarah Buckle after she was administered an incapacitating substance (Picture: Sarah Buckle) ‘I’m terrified at the fact that whoever did this is still out there,’ she said. ‘I’m really, really scared. That’s another reason why I’m demanding that the government does more to protect women. ‘I understand it is hard to make arrests and secure convictions so it’s important to make sure that those responsible have little chance to carry out these attacks again. ‘I’ve suffered extreme anxiousness that this could happen again to me or my friends. It makes you question everyone. Sarah Buckle found a mark resembling a pin-prick on her hand but believes there is also a chance she could have had her drink spiked (Picture: Sarah Buckle) ‘It was at a freshers’ night and while you think of middle age men harassing young women, it could have been someone I go to university with. ‘Who knows? It’s a really scary thought.’ Sarah joined calls from students and other women demanding the government and nightclub industry does more to tackle the problem. One petition, on the government’s dedicated website, calls for all venues to be legally required to ‘thoroughly search’ guests on entry. More than 167,000 people have signed to date. A dozen reports have been made to Nottinghamshire Police of people’s drinks being spiked since September 4, with the largest number being made last weekend. A spate of cases where women have been spiked in nightclubs have been reported to police (Picture: Getty Images/iStockphoto) Two men were arrested last week on suspicion of administering poison in connection with the spate of allegations. They were held ‘on suspicion of conspiracy to administer poison with intent to injure, annoy or aggrieve’ before being released under investigation. The arrests are not being linked to any specific allegation of spiking by a needle, or contamination of a drink, and followed information from a member of the public after a general appeal from a senior officer.

An EV stock to park in your portfolio Scott Levine (Fisker ): Revving up to present its third-quarter earnings report on Nov. 3, Fisker is an electric vehicle company that is a fairly new option for investors, having made its market debut almost exactly one year ago. Those who follow the EV industry closely will surely recognize the company's name; however, it's also likely that many investors are unfamiliar with the EV start-up considering the flurry of EV companies that have gone public through special purpose acquisition company deals recently. Add to this the fact that Fisker doesn't have any vehicles on the road yet, and it's probable that Fisker is not on many growth investors' radars. But it certainly should be. Between the company's disruptive approach to financing and the stock trading at around $14 -- 55% below its 52-week high -- it certainly warrants consideration . One of the biggest challenges facing EV makers is the hesitancy that prospective customers have regarding charging their vehicles. Helping to allay these concerns, Fisker offers customers who find that they're not as charged up about going electric as they thought they'd be the option to return leased vehicles at any time without penalty. Management's willingness to implement an innovative approach to vehicle leasing suggests that it's not only cognizant of a potential roadblock to its success, but that it's not willing to yield to convention. As of early August, Fisker has 17,500 reservations for its Ocean SUV, indicating that there's already interest in the company's offering. By 2025, management is targeting annual sales of 200,000 to 250,000 -- a year in which it expects to expand its product offerings to four vehicles and which it expects to recognize a sizable improvement in its financials. While the company expects to generate free cash flow of negative $300 million in 2022, it forecasts free cash flow of $1.9 billion in 2025. That's the type of growth that can electrify investors' excitement. UPS has long-term upside but may face near-term setbacks Daniel Foelber (United Parcel Service): America's largest package delivery company, UPS, reports Q3 earnings on Tuesday. In addition to watching the usual suspects like the top and bottom line, margins, and other financial figures, investors will likely have their eyes peeled and their ears perked to gain insight into management's thoughts on supply chain constraints and the labor shortage. Investors following the package delivery space know that FedEx and UPS report earnings about six weeks apart instead of at the same time. This staggered schedule is convenient because it provides more frequent insight into industrywide headwinds and tailwinds. FedEx's most recent earnings report illustrated the sheer magnitude that the tight labor market and challenging supply chain are having on its margins. Its quarter wasn't pretty, and FedEx stock fell hard , dragging down UPS with it. To combat inflation, FedEx is raising prices next year. Investors should listen to UPS management's commentary on these topics to see how it expects to navigate market challenges, and the extent that it, too, will raise prices (if at all). In addition to these short-term talking points, growth investors will likely monitor UPS' e-commerce growth , rebound in business-to-business sales, and international performance. UPS is a value stock that has been transforming into a growth stock over the last few years because it's leaned into previously untapped markets. Its investments to grow its e-commerce offering have made it a preferred shipping and logistics partner for small and medium-sized businesses. Investors should gird their loins if UPS expects a sizable impact to its short-term performance due to macroeconomic factors. But as long as the big picture remains intact, UPS is one of the best industrial stocks on the market today . Emerson Electric is about to enter a growth phase Lee Samaha (Emerson Electric): It's been a long time coming, but energy-related spending is making a comeback. That's great news for companies with substantive process automation businesses like Emerson Electric. In total, oil and gas make up around 19% of Emerson's sales with chemicals and refining contributing another 11% and 6%. Process automation is the processing of raw materials into an initial product. As a result, spending in the industry tends to be lumpy and contingent on customers feeling confident in the long-term outlook for their end markets. As such, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a stalling of investment within the processing industry. However, oil services companies like Halliburton are talking about an extended upcycle in oil and gas spending. Meanwhile, Emerson's process automation rival Honeywell International noted that its refining catalyst and absorbents orders surged by 30% in the second quarter. That's important because it suggests refining investment is coming back, and as Honeywell's management noted , that usually flows through into increased spending in process automation down the line. Everything points to a cyclical recovery in Emerson's process automation. Meanwhile, the company's commercial and residential solutions segment's (climate technology, energy efficiency, refrigeration) orders were up a whopping 43% in the trailing three months to June, so future revenue growth is assured. And finally, the recent deal to take a 55% stake in industrial software company Aspen Technology adds another string to the bow of Emerson's software expansion strategy. All told, Emerson looks well set for growth in the coming years.",,fool,"[('Fisker', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY')]",0.0,0.0,0.9

KUCHING, Oct 26 ― Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture Datuk Seri Abdul Karim Rahman Hamzah calls for no open campaign and no open rally to facilitate the next Sarawak election.“No open campaigning or no open rally does not mean that democracy is curtailed,” the Parti Pesaka Bumiputera Bersatu (PBB) vice president said.Abdul Karim pointed out that there are other ways and means candidates in election can promote themselves, especially in this digital era.“We have seen what had happened in Sabah after they held their snap state election (in September 2020),” said the Asajaya assemblyman.“In view of Sarawak having to undergo a state election soon, it is advisable for the Election Commission (or SPR) to find ways to make sure that the ‘mistakes’ made during last Sabah state election are not repeated,” he added.Abdul Karim was reacting to the latest comment by Minister of Health Khairy Jamaluddin that no election-related social gatherings or activities are allowed to facilitate the coming Melaka snap state election in order to reduce Covid-19 infection among people there.Khairy said the order is to take effect yesterday (October 25) until November 27, 2021.When contacted yesterday, Parti Rakyat Sarawak (PRS) secretary-general Dato Janang Bungsu said he agreed with Khairy.“Agree that it should be within the stipulated standard operating procedures (SOPs). After all, we are yet to come out from Covid-19 problem. Stringent SOPs must be observed to minimise physical contact,” added Janang.Progressive Democratic Party (PDP) vice president Datu Dr Penguang Manggil however said it would still be premature now to talk about SOPs for Sarawak election which is being stalled as the state is under the Emergency Order (EO) until its expiry on February 1, 2022.“The SOPs mentioned therein are for Melaka, during this given time and circumstances. It may be relevant to be imposed in Melaka but may or may not be necessary for Sarawak,” said the Assistant Minister of Housing and Local Government.“It is also too premature to talk about the SOPs as we have to know when the Emergency is to be lifted and the State Legislative Assembly (DUN) is to be dissolved.“I am pretty confident that the Ministry of Health (MoH), State Health Department, the SPR and the Sarawak Disaster Management Committee will be duly consulted and SOP formulated, taking all factors and any emerging issues before the decision to call for the PRN12 (12th Sarawak election) is made,” said Penguang, who is also Marudi assemblyman.Khairy had said in a media statement on October 24: “Based on the monitoring by the Ministry of Health, among the contributors to the increase in cases and Covid-19 clusters in the country were related to the activities of gatherings or social gatherings that did not comply with the standard operating procedures (SOPs).”The MoH expected that similar activities will take place leading up to the Melaka state election on November 20, he said.“As the risk of Covid-19 infection is still high, especially with the spread of the Delta variant in the community, and the increasing number of new Covid-19 cases which have been reported, such activities will further increase the risk of Covid-19 infection within the community,” he said.Last Monday, the SPR set November 8 as the nomination date for the Melaka state election while the voting date is November 20.Khairy explained that this ban is in line with the list of unauthorised activities (negative list) in the latest SOPs for states under Phase 4 of the National Recovery Plan (PPN).Talks are rife in Sarawak that nomination day and polling day for the state election are slated for Nov 13 and Nov 27 respectively if the Yang di-Pertuan Agong wishes to repeal the EO earlier than its expiry date. ― Borneo Post",2021-10-25 23:28:05,,,malaymail,"[('Jamaluddin', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY'), ('Janang Bungsu', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY'), ('Janang.', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY'), ('Melaka', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY'), ('Melaka', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY'), ('Agong', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY')]",0.0,0.5,0.6

How this Oklahoma ranch is using nuclear families to upend the foster care system,https://www.deseret.com/2021/10/24/22661072/how-this-oklahoma-ranch-is-using-nuclear-families-to-upend-the-foster-care-system-peppers-ranch,,['Naomi Schaefer Riley'],,,"Photo Illustration by Alex Cochran, Deseret News Most often sibling groups are either separated or tend to languish in foster care. Peppers Ranch is changing that Desie’s eyes grow wide as she looks over the menu at Cattlemen’s Steakhouse, a popular destination with tourists, local families and even cowboys in the Stockyards area outside of Oklahoma City. The 8-year-old Desie does not get to go out for dinner often — the nine other children in her family make that logistically and financially challenging — but that does not stop this soon-to-be third grader from sharing her adventurous tastes. “I’m going to start with the shrimp cocktail,” she announces to the half of our group of 14 sitting at one table. Desie came to stay with Ashlee and Matt Terry when she was 8 days old. It was part of a “Home for the Holidays” emergency placement. Desie came to the Terrys right after Thanksgiving in 2012 while child welfare services figured out what to do with her; she never left. Desie was actually the fourth child placed with the Terrys. Their first placements were in 2011 — sisters Evie and Piper — and then their biological sister Bella a few months later. In 2014, with four daughters, three bedrooms and only one shower, they decided they did not have the space for more. Ashlee recalls: “I said that when God provided more bathrooms, we would reopen our home.” God seemed to answer their prayer when they were offered a spot at Peppers Ranch, a community in Guthrie, about 30 minutes from Oklahoma City. The ranch harnesses an old-fashioned understanding of family, neighborhood and community to solve the problems of a new generation of displaced children. Opened in 2002, with the donation of 160 acres of land, Peppers Ranch was originally a residential facility for abused and neglected boys. The donor, Hal French, a local oil and gas entrepreneur, had grown up near a boys home and often played with the children there, and wanted to create a similar opportunity for more kids. After a few years, things seemed to be going OK for the boys who came to Peppers Ranch. But their sisters were just being dropped off at a local shelter. The girls had no equivalent and, more importantly, the siblings were losing their connection to one another. Which got French and the other folks at Peppers Ranch to thinking. According to research from Casey Family Programs, “approximately two-thirds of children in foster care have a sibling in care, and yet — despite the benefits of joint sibling placements — it is estimated that more than 70% of children with siblings are separated from one or more of their siblings while in care.” Benefits of placing siblings together include lower incidence of behavioral problems and a higher chance they will both like and adapt to their foster homes and have better academic performance. But finding foster or adoptive families that have the capacity to take in sibling groups is hard. Even if parents have an extra bed in their home or are willing to take in two siblings, what are the chances they have the space (let alone the time and energy) to take in three or four? The result is that sibling groups are either separated or tend to languish in foster care for longer. And so Peppers Ranch tried something different. In 2009, after extensive studies, the leadership decided to move to a family model, offering couples who were already licensed to do foster care in Oklahoma the opportunity to move to Peppers Ranch. There they could live in one of the newly built houses, paying only a couple of hundred dollars in rent and receiving a small stipend in addition to what the state offered for foster care, if they were willing to open their home to at least five foster children. Today, there are 16 homes on the property (with plans to build a few more over the next few years), all more than 3,000 square feet. The typical home has four bedrooms, a large living area and an industrial-size kitchen and pantry. The more recent homes even have hookups for two washers and dryers as well as larger garages in which families can park their super-size vans. The entire community has an annual budget of about $1.5 million, all from private donations. In addition to money, locals also donate furniture, clothing and other necessities. Hundreds of volunteers help maintain the grounds and run programs for the kids. Spark Creative One of the homes Peppers Ranch provides to its foster families. Set amid farmlands at the end of a dirt road which is prone to flooding, the community may seem inconvenient to some, but for the families at Peppers Ranch, it offers everything they need. The landscape feels a little sparse — not enough time has passed for many trees to mature on the land. Each family has a backyard, equipped with all the trampolines and play structures you would find in a typical suburban neighborhood. There is also a community basketball court and soccer field, a playground and pool complex, a pond where the kids can fish, and a barn with 17 horses. The horses, many of which are older and have been donated in their retirement, are used for equestrian therapy. They are gentle and the kids enjoy helping to care for them. Indeed, one of the Peppers Ranch mothers told me how excited her 6-year-old adoptive son was when he was given his very own pooper scooper for the horses. “They need my help,” he would tell his mother before running over to the barn. Each family also has to help with chores around the community — including feeding the horses over a weekend when the trainer is not around. The logistics of being a foster parent, especially with multiple children in the home, can be overwhelming. Multiple therapy appointments a week, in addition to arranging visitation with biological parents, meetings with social workers and court dates can make even the most organized person’s head spin. But Peppers Ranch brings at least some of those services to the community. There is a learning center where children can receive after-school tutoring. The ranch also offers art therapy, dance therapy, a swim team and a variety of other extracurricular activities. Parents pay a small fee for these out of the stipends they receive. The community requires at least one parent to work full time. But the subsidized housing at Peppers Ranch means one parent can stay home full time — and most of the time they do. With so many kids, especially ones who have behavioral and emotional challenges, it is hard to outsource child care. But the state stipends do not allow a typical middle-class foster family to give up one income. In families with older kids, mothers sometimes have part-time jobs they can do from home during school hours. Mostly it’s the mothers at home but in at least one case it’s the father who cares for the children while the mother works as a hospital nurse. Whoever stays home, the arrangement is a relief for parents. Dustin Burpo, a family pastor at a nearby church and a parent at Peppers Ranch, tells me that he and his wife recently looked at their budget. “We’ve got a house to stay in, a nice house that has plenty of space for our large capacity living” — the Burpos have eight children — “It truly gives you that peace of mind. It’s a weight off my shoulders, knowing that I’ve got a place for my kids.” But it’s not just the homes. It’s the community. Most of the families give their kids freedom to roam. Matt Terry says that’s one of the things he likes about Peppers Ranch, that it feels like a more old-fashioned neighborhood. It’s certainly true that it’s small enough for everyone to know everyone else. Shelly Blankenship, who has been at Peppers Ranch since 2011 and fostered around 80 children here, compares it to when she grew up across the street from her grandmother and down the street from her aunt. “You couldn’t get away with anything.” When she sees kids misbehaving at Peppers Ranch, she will say, “I don’t think you need to be doing that.” They will ask if she is going to tell their mother. Her response? “Do I need to tell her? If you’re going to quit and act right, then I don’t have to tell her anything. We’ve already taken care of it.” Even if they lived in such a neighborhood today, though, parents of foster children and children adopted out of foster care often have a much more difficult calculation about giving their children freedom. Should you let a kid wander around a neighborhood knowing that they have been traumatized by other adults? Are there psychological and behavioral problems that could pop up if something scares them or surprises them? How will other adults respond? Will their fellow parents blame them if something goes wrong? And this is really the genius of Peppers Ranch. It is a supportive community filled with other children who have gone through similar things and other adults who are trying to help those children. While many of the families at Peppers Ranch have found some level of support for their foster care efforts among friends and family, they often felt isolated before they came here. “You have behaviors for a child and you think that something is wrong with me as a parent,” says Kristin Burpo, Dustin’s wife. “You just feel judged, even in a church community,” she tells me. At Peppers Ranch, veteran parents often serve as mentors to the newer ones. The mothers meet at least once a month to talk about the issues that they are facing with their children, where to find resources to help, how to deal with the emotional toll that fostering is taking on them, their marriages, and even their other children. Most research shows that about half of all foster parents quit within their first year. Kristin Martinez understands why. Martinez, who has one biological child and seven adopted children, remembers the day she took in a 16-year-old girl. “I never had a teenager before. I could immediately go to other neighbors and they were able to provide me with great information and great resources.” Her children are playing in the backyard when I arrive, but then come in and sit down with us, periodically asking when it will be time to go get snow cones. She also describes the other trials of being a foster parent, including the “heartbreak” of having a child leave after a long time to go back to their biological family. She asks me to imagine having a child live with you for a year or more, having him or her become part of your children’s lives and then never seeing them again. Or what about “when you’re going through the heartbreak of going to all the court dates”? Martinez recalls “the heartbreak of the biological parents never getting it together. Witnessing the heartbreak that happens to your child. It’s a very emotional roller coaster, this life.” A couple of her older kids nod in agreement. She finds it reassuring that “there’s somebody here to understand that. When you’re having a really hard day and you’re in tears because it’s so hard,” she says, it means so much to her “to have people that literally understand exactly what you’re going through. … To have people that you can do this life with is pretty special.” There is also a network of support for children who live at Peppers Ranch and did not come from foster care. Few people can understand the journey of biological children whose parents keep bringing new children into the home. As Shelly Blankenship acknowledges, “My kids weren’t from trauma, but I put trauma in their lives.” But being at Peppers Ranch has helped her children process that. Rather than putting all this emotional chaos behind her, her daughter, who is now 25, has guardianship over a 17-year-old in the system. Kristin Burpo appreciates that her children see “unconditional love” in her home and in the other homes at Peppers Ranch. “This is always my prayer, that they would see my heart in all of it. And no matter the child that comes in my home, they’re my child when they’re in my home.” Memory McElhaney The Burpo family enjoys some time on the beach. During COVID-19, the community created its own bubble. The kids would still play with each other, going on field trips to state parks some days. The moms would get together, pick up some food and sit in one of their vans to get a break from the kids. “We did that once a week just to try to keep our sanity,” Kristin recalls. The Burpos had two biological children when they took in Shanaya, their first foster child from a family that her husband’s brother (a pastor) knew from his church. Even in a community that was welcoming, she worried that their children might stick out. “Our daughter is black and we are white. It was a little bit awkward” in the small town they lived in before Peppers Ranch. “Coming out here, we know that Shanaya would grow up not feeling odd. Coming to a community where everybody was accepted the way they were because it was just normal. … That was really big for us.” Since moving to Peppers Ranch, they have adopted two sets of siblings: Shakota, 8, Sky, 7, and Trinity, 6; and JC, 4, and Keisha, 3. When I visit their house the chaos is controlled. Kristin is folding laundry. The older kids have helped the younger kids get their sandwiches for lunch and they are passing around the largest container of cheese balls I have ever seen. Three of the younger kids go to watch cartoons when they are done. The family has just come back from a vacation Bible school camp and they are trying to get back into a routine. Dustin, their father, is a pastor at a church about 40 minutes away. Peppers Ranch is not a faith-based organization but every one of the families there is guided in some way by their religious beliefs. Ashley Hahn, the director of the ranch, says they have all “felt called through faith to this walk.” She tells me, “I’m a person of faith. I don’t know how you could do it without knowing the Lord is on your side.” Most of the Burpo kids ignore me, but one of the girls takes me on a grand tour of the house, showing me what’s inside of each of the closets, introducing me to the cat. She seems to crave attention in a way that would be typical for an outgoing 7-year-old. And she clearly enjoys showing off for guests. But then she starts taking watermelon rinds out of the garbage and chewing on them. When Dustin notices, he is calm but firm, asking her to stop. After she does it again, he takes her aside, offering a sterner but still completely calm warning. The kids, as Kristin explains to me over the third basket of laundry, have all manner of diagnoses. A number were born with drugs in their systems. Others watched their parents physically abuse each other and experienced severe neglect as they were shuttled back and forth among parents too strung out to care for them and grandparents who were overwhelmed. Providing a stable environment with love and clear boundaries is important, but the Burpos have tried to consider in other ways how they parent. Almost everyone at Peppers Ranch has been through training in how to deal with kids who have experienced trauma. Dustin also says he talks to other fathers at the ranch about their unique role. Many of the kids have no responsible adult male in their lives. “We are fathers to the fatherless.” Dustin, who counts himself lucky for growing up with a father and a stepfather, says he fears for these kids, many of whom “don’t know who their biological father is and they probably never will know. I get to fill that role. And it’s very humbling and scary at the same time.” Peppers Ranch families think about the building blocks of a normal family and how to re-create them for kids who have come out of dysfunctional homes. Kristin has seen up close how vital it is for sibling groups to stay together. It’s difficult for younger kids because they want to have at least one of the older people they look up to present in their lives. But “when it’s an older child taking care of a younger child and then they are split, … the older child was the caretaker and then they have no purpose.” Ashlee and Matt met doing a training offered by the Oklahoma Department of Health Services. She was training to be a caseworker, helping foster children find permanency. He was training to be a child abuse investigator. It wasn’t long before they were married and began taking in foster children themselves. Matt says that Ashlee is the one in charge of all the logistics of the family and making sure everything works, but it’s clear that his experience working with this population of children has driven him here as well. In his first few months on the job, he discovered three dead children. It was during the rise of meth labs in the area a few years ago. “We didn’t know what we were stepping into.” At dinner with the Terry family at Cattlemen’s, the dynamics of the siblings seems both happy and familiar. Their oldest son, Jose, who is 18 and just finished high school, took his younger brother to the bathroom more than once during dinner and helped him order food. In addition to Dessie, the Terrys have adopted one set of three sisters and another set of five brothers and sisters and are fostering the nephew of the five, born to an older sister who is an adult. Jose is living at home while he is enrolled in local vocational training program. He says he wants to become and electrician and move to Las Vegas. Ashlee, who took him to Vegas for his 18th birthday and celebrated with him by getting tattoos together, jokes that with all those lights there should plenty for him to do. His next youngest sister listens excitedly and talks about her plans for the future, too. She has multiple babysitting jobs and likes caring for children but is also thinking about cosmetology. When we sit down, the kids divide themselves more by age than by their families of origin. But the fact that they are with the people they grew up with seems to set them at ease. Certainly dinner with 10 kids turns out to be much more serene than you might expect. Despite having to wait over an hour for a table — by which point my own children would be losing their minds — these children were patient and kind, asking their parents polite questions and making conversation with me and DaNysha Wright, the programs and outreach director for Peppers Ranch. When 17-year-old Aurelia asks DaNysha whether she would ever foster or adopt herself, she looks around the table smiling. Desie takes advantage of her moment of hesitation to explain, “I think you need to find a man first!” In some ways, Peppers Ranch has a sort of artificial feel. The current families have to meet with potential new families and decide whether they should be able to move in. Families can only stay in the community as long as their homes are open to foster children, even if only on a temporary basis. A number of families have ended their foster care “journeys” after a few years and children from other homes talk about missing their friends. Of course, this could happen in any neighborhood. Ashlee Terry Children play on the property of Peppers Ranch. Peppers Ranch does try to provide continuity for kids in other ways. They have a “Grandma” program, in which older people who have either moved on from fostering or who simply want to help out, can live in one of a few small apartments in the community. They form their own relationships with the kids, inviting them over to bake cookies or help with homework. They host playdates for the little ones to give the moms a break and organize art projects for the older kids. One of the new grandmas, Kim Magallanes, moved here from California after her son and daughter-in-law came a few years ago. She is retired but filled with energy and has started to build relationships with the kids. She also has experience with horses and plans to help out in the barn as well. She keeps a stash of carrots in her refrigerator in case one of the kids comes by and wants to go feed them. Kim remembers when she was a child “going to my grandparents’ house, things that I now realize were chores, were fun. Hanging clothes on the line and picking berries and learning how to bake.” Being a grandmother at Peppers Ranch is “just being another person these kids can hang out with.” She’s taking a group of the teenagers on a trip to a camp a few hours away a couple of days after we meet. Other communities have attempted to harness the power and time of an older generation to build connections with foster children. In an article called “It Takes a Multigenerational Village to Raise Foster Kids” the authors who work at an organization called Hope Meadows describe how they have created communities in which foster families live in close proximity to older adults. The programs, which are funded in part with public dollars, offer “intergenerational art and other classes, weekly community dinners, and a community garden, where young and older residents can meet and strengthen ties.” Indeed, such communities are part of a larger conversation we seem to be having in this country about the need for more communal support to raise all children. Last year, David Brooks penned an article for The Atlantic arguing that the nuclear family had failed us. He bemoaned the loss of extended families and tightly-connected neighborhoods, suggesting that “forged families” are the future, people who may not be related by blood, but have chosen to live in community. A New Yorker article on communal living among adults focuses on arrangements like Treehouse Hollywood, which author Nathan Heller describes as “a space for community living, where people of many ages and from many walks of life eat together, spend time together, and conduct their lives largely in common view.” At least one young single mother who was interviewed says she found support for her child rearing with the other adults there. As Brooks writes: “Americans are hungering to live in extended and forged families, in ways that are new and ancient at the same time. This is a significant opportunity, a chance to thicken and broaden family relationships, a chance to allow more adults and children to live and grow under the loving gaze of a dozen pairs of eyes, and be caught, when they fall, by a dozen pairs of arms.” There are certainly a dozen arms waiting to catch the kids at Peppers Ranch, but they are primarily being cared for by nuclear families. Each couple makes decisions about bringing children into their family — each contracts with the state of Oklahoma separately to care for these kids. They have different rules for their children make different decisions about where to send their children to school and how much to involve themselves with other families in the community. They take different vacations and attend different camps. Each couple is guided by their own faith and attend a variety of churches. These children have often come from environments where there were a dozen pairs of arms — parents, grandmothers, aunts, neighbors — but none of them were responsible or capable enough to be the children’s primary caretakers, which is how they ended up in foster care in the first place. Peppers Ranch is built on a different notion — that children need two parents, including in most cases one who works and one who is at home, and the presence of their biological siblings if possible. These family units can certainly stand to benefit from the support of others in the community — the grandmothers, the other fathers and mothers in the same position, the counselors and therapists and learning specialists — but the family is the thing. Naomi Schaefer Riley is a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a Deseret News contributor and the author of “No Way to Treat a Child: How the Foster Care System, Family Courts, and Racial Activists Are Wrecking Young Lives.”",2021-10-25 04:24:04,"Desie’s eyes grow wide as she looks over the menu at Cattlemen’s Steakhouse, a popular destination with tourists, local families and even cowboys in the Stockyards area outside of Oklahoma City. The 8-year-old Desie does not get to go out for dinner often — the nine other children in her family make that logistically and financially challenging — but that does not stop this soon-to-be third grader from sharing her adventurous tastes. “I’m going to start with the shrimp cocktail,” she announces to the half of our group of 14 sitting at one table. Desie came to stay with Ashlee and Matt Terry when she was 8 days old. It was part of a “Home for the Holidays” emergency placement. Desie came to the Terrys right after Thanksgiving in 2012 while child welfare services figured out what to do with her; she never left. Desie was actually the fourth child placed with the Terrys. Their first placements were in 2011 — sisters Evie and Piper — and then their biological sister Bella a few months later. In 2014, with four daughters, three bedrooms and only one shower, they decided they did not have the space for more. Ashlee recalls: “I said that when God provided more bathrooms, we would reopen our home.” God seemed to answer their prayer when they were offered a spot at Peppers Ranch, a community in Guthrie, about 30 minutes from Oklahoma City. The ranch harnesses an old-fashioned understanding of family, neighborhood and community to solve the problems of a new generation of displaced children. Opened in 2002, with the donation of 160 acres of land, Peppers Ranch was originally a residential facility for abused and neglected boys. The donor, Hal French, a local oil and gas entrepreneur, had grown up near a boys home and often played with the children there, and wanted to create a similar opportunity for more kids. After a few years, things seemed to be going OK for the boys who came to Peppers Ranch. But their sisters were just being dropped off at a local shelter. The girls had no equivalent and, more importantly, the siblings were losing their connection to one another. Which got French and the other folks at Peppers Ranch to thinking. According to research from Casey Family Programs, “approximately two-thirds of children in foster care have a sibling in care, and yet — despite the benefits of joint sibling placements — it is estimated that more than 70% of children with siblings are separated from one or more of their siblings while in care.” Benefits of placing siblings together include lower incidence of behavioral problems and a higher chance they will both like and adapt to their foster homes and have better academic performance. Related She outgrew foster care, but the hardship didn’t stop there But finding foster or adoptive families that have the capacity to take in sibling groups is hard. Even if parents have an extra bed in their home or are willing to take in two siblings, what are the chances they have the space (let alone the time and energy) to take in three or four? The result is that sibling groups are either separated or tend to languish in foster care for longer. And so Peppers Ranch tried something different. In 2009, after extensive studies, the leadership decided to move to a family model, offering couples who were already licensed to do foster care in Oklahoma the opportunity to move to Peppers Ranch. There they could live in one of the newly built houses, paying only a couple of hundred dollars in rent and receiving a small stipend in addition to what the state offered for foster care, if they were willing to open their home to at least five foster children. Today, there are 16 homes on the property (with plans to build a few more over the next few years), all more than 3,000 square feet. The typical home has four bedrooms, a large living area and an industrial-size kitchen and pantry. The more recent homes even have hookups for two washers and dryers as well as larger garages in which families can park their super-size vans. The entire community has an annual budget of about $1.5 million, all from private donations. In addition to money, locals also donate furniture, clothing and other necessities. Hundreds of volunteers help maintain the grounds and run programs for the kids. One of the homes Peppers Ranch provides to its foster families. Spark Creative Set amid farmlands at the end of a dirt road which is prone to flooding, the community may seem inconvenient to some, but for the families at Peppers Ranch, it offers everything they need. The landscape feels a little sparse — not enough time has passed for many trees to mature on the land. Each family has a backyard, equipped with all the trampolines and play structures you would find in a typical suburban neighborhood. There is also a community basketball court and soccer field, a playground and pool complex, a pond where the kids can fish, and a barn with 17 horses. The horses, many of which are older and have been donated in their retirement, are used for equestrian therapy. They are gentle and the kids enjoy helping to care for them. Indeed, one of the Peppers Ranch mothers told me how excited her 6-year-old adoptive son was when he was given his very own pooper scooper for the horses. “They need my help,” he would tell his mother before running over to the barn. Each family also has to help with chores around the community — including feeding the horses over a weekend when the trainer is not around. The logistics of being a foster parent, especially with multiple children in the home, can be overwhelming. Multiple therapy appointments a week, in addition to arranging visitation with biological parents, meetings with social workers and court dates can make even the most organized person’s head spin. But Peppers Ranch brings at least some of those services to the community. There is a learning center where children can receive after-school tutoring. The ranch also offers art therapy, dance therapy, a swim team and a variety of other extracurricular activities. Parents pay a small fee for these out of the stipends they receive. The community requires at least one parent to work full time. But the subsidized housing at Peppers Ranch means one parent can stay home full time — and most of the time they do. With so many kids, especially ones who have behavioral and emotional challenges, it is hard to outsource child care. But the state stipends do not allow a typical middle-class foster family to give up one income. In families with older kids, mothers sometimes have part-time jobs they can do from home during school hours. Mostly it’s the mothers at home but in at least one case it’s the father who cares for the children while the mother works as a hospital nurse. Whoever stays home, the arrangement is a relief for parents. Dustin Burpo, a family pastor at a nearby church and a parent at Peppers Ranch, tells me that he and his wife recently looked at their budget. “We’ve got a house to stay in, a nice house that has plenty of space for our large capacity living” — the Burpos have eight children — “It truly gives you that peace of mind. It’s a weight off my shoulders, knowing that I’ve got a place for my kids.” But it’s not just the homes. It’s the community. Most of the families give their kids freedom to roam. Matt Terry says that’s one of the things he likes about Peppers Ranch, that it feels like a more old-fashioned neighborhood. It’s certainly true that it’s small enough for everyone to know everyone else. Shelly Blankenship, who has been at Peppers Ranch since 2011 and fostered around 80 children here, compares it to when she grew up across the street from her grandmother and down the street from her aunt. “You couldn’t get away with anything.” When she sees kids misbehaving at Peppers Ranch, she will say, “I don’t think you need to be doing that.” They will ask if she is going to tell their mother. Her response? “Do I need to tell her? If you’re going to quit and act right, then I don’t have to tell her anything. We’ve already taken care of it.” Even if they lived in such a neighborhood today, though, parents of foster children and children adopted out of foster care often have a much more difficult calculation about giving their children freedom. Should you let a kid wander around a neighborhood knowing that they have been traumatized by other adults? Are there psychological and behavioral problems that could pop up if something scares them or surprises them? How will other adults respond? Will their fellow parents blame them if something goes wrong? Related Opinion: Religious foster care plays a vital role for our most vulnerable children And this is really the genius of Peppers Ranch. It is a supportive community filled with other children who have gone through similar things and other adults who are trying to help those children. While many of the families at Peppers Ranch have found some level of support for their foster care efforts among friends and family, they often felt isolated before they came here. “You have behaviors for a child and you think that something is wrong with me as a parent,” says Kristin Burpo, Dustin’s wife. “You just feel judged, even in a church community,” she tells me. At Peppers Ranch, veteran parents often serve as mentors to the newer ones. The mothers meet at least once a month to talk about the issues that they are facing with their children, where to find resources to help, how to deal with the emotional toll that fostering is taking on them, their marriages, and even their other children. Most research shows that about half of all foster parents quit within their first year. Kristin Martinez understands why. Martinez, who has one biological child and seven adopted children, remembers the day she took in a 16-year-old girl. “I never had a teenager before. I could immediately go to other neighbors and they were able to provide me with great information and great resources.” Her children are playing in the backyard when I arrive, but then come in and sit down with us, periodically asking when it will be time to go get snow cones. She also describes the other trials of being a foster parent, including the “heartbreak” of having a child leave after a long time to go back to their biological family. She asks me to imagine having a child live with you for a year or more, having him or her become part of your children’s lives and then never seeing them again. Or what about “when you’re going through the heartbreak of going to all the court dates”? Martinez recalls “the heartbreak of the biological parents never getting it together. Witnessing the heartbreak that happens to your child. It’s a very emotional roller coaster, this life.” A couple of her older kids nod in agreement. She finds it reassuring that “there’s somebody here to understand that. When you’re having a really hard day and you’re in tears because it’s so hard,” she says, it means so much to her “to have people that literally understand exactly what you’re going through. … To have people that you can do this life with is pretty special.” There is also a network of support for children who live at Peppers Ranch and did not come from foster care. Few people can understand the journey of biological children whose parents keep bringing new children into the home. As Shelly Blankenship acknowledges, “My kids weren’t from trauma, but I put trauma in their lives.” But being at Peppers Ranch has helped her children process that. Rather than putting all this emotional chaos behind her, her daughter, who is now 25, has guardianship over a 17-year-old in the system. Kristin Burpo appreciates that her children see “unconditional love” in her home and in the other homes at Peppers Ranch. “This is always my prayer, that they would see my heart in all of it. And no matter the child that comes in my home, they’re my child when they’re in my home.” The Burpo family enjoys some time on the beach. Memory McElhaney During COVID-19, the community created its own bubble. The kids would still play with each other, going on field trips to state parks some days. The moms would get together, pick up some food and sit in one of their vans to get a break from the kids. “We did that once a week just to try to keep our sanity,” Kristin recalls. The Burpos had two biological children when they took in Shanaya, their first foster child from a family that her husband’s brother (a pastor) knew from his church. Even in a community that was welcoming, she worried that their children might stick out. “Our daughter is black and we are white. It was a little bit awkward” in the small town they lived in before Peppers Ranch. “Coming out here, we know that Shanaya would grow up not feeling odd. Coming to a community where everybody was accepted the way they were because it was just normal. … That was really big for us.” Since moving to Peppers Ranch, they have adopted two sets of siblings: Shakota, 8, Sky, 7, and Trinity, 6; and JC, 4, and Keisha, 3. When I visit their house the chaos is controlled. Kristin is folding laundry. The older kids have helped the younger kids get their sandwiches for lunch and they are passing around the largest container of cheese balls I have ever seen. Three of the younger kids go to watch cartoons when they are done. The family has just come back from a vacation Bible school camp and they are trying to get back into a routine. Dustin, their father, is a pastor at a church about 40 minutes away. Peppers Ranch is not a faith-based organization but every one of the families there is guided in some way by their religious beliefs. Ashley Hahn, the director of the ranch, says they have all “felt called through faith to this walk.” She tells me, “I’m a person of faith. I don’t know how you could do it without knowing the Lord is on your side.” Most of the Burpo kids ignore me, but one of the girls takes me on a grand tour of the house, showing me what’s inside of each of the closets, introducing me to the cat. She seems to crave attention in a way that would be typical for an outgoing 7-year-old. And she clearly enjoys showing off for guests. But then she starts taking watermelon rinds out of the garbage and chewing on them. When Dustin notices, he is calm but firm, asking her to stop.

They also affect workers’ health, since pesticides need to be sprayed frequently. Based in Kuala Lumpur, Poladrone wants to change the way farms use pesticides with a combination of drones and automation and analytics software. The company announced today it has raised a $4.29 million seed round led by Wavemaker Partners, which it says is the largest seed round ever raised in Malaysia, based on data from Crunchbase. Other participants include the Malaysian Technology Development Corporation (MTDC), which is wholly-owned by Khazanah Nasional Berhad, the Malaysian government’s sovereign wealth fund; ZB Capital Limited; and angel investors. Founded in 2016 by Cheong Jin Xi, Poladrone now operates in Malaysia and Thailand and plans to expand into Indonesia, the world’s largest oil palm producer. Cheong told TechCrunch that Poladrone is profitable, but decided to seek funding after the COVID-19 pandemic hit and “highlighted the positive impact our technology has on agriculture communities by creating jobs and upskilling opportunities.” Indonesian agritech platform TaniHub Group harvests a $65.5M Series B round Adoption of Poladrone’s drones also increased during labor shortages caused by the pandemic, and the startup grew its team from 20 people to over 80 in less than a year to meet demand. Its seed round will be used for more hiring and to scale operations and build more Service Centers in agricultural areas, where clients can buy equipment and spare parts. Cheong first became interested in drones when he was a high school student in Melbourne, Australia, and it led to him pursuing an aerospace engineering degree at university. After Cheong returned to Malaysia, he began looking at potential applications for drone technology and realized “the agriculture industry made perfect sense,” because drones can fly over large terrains to perform repetitive tasks autonomously, and their cameras also capture a large amount of data. Cheong’s interest in agritech was also inspired by growing up in Kuala Lipis, an agricultural town in the state of Pahang. Many of his family members and relatives are involved in farming, and his early insights went into the development of Poladrone’s products. Rhinoceros beetles are a serious problem during the first three years of an oil palm’s 25 year lifecycle, he said, because attacks hurt trees’ growth, delaying them from reaching maturity and sometimes killing plants. “The issue is that once the surrounding oil palms matures, replanting is no longer possible which means that any space wasted on a dead palm would be wasted for the next 22 years,” Cheong said. As a result, oil palm farms usually need to perform preventative pesticide spraying every two weeks for the first two years after oil palms are planted, then every month until they mature. This is often done by workers with knapsack sprayers or on tractors. One of Poladrone’s Service Centers In 2020, the company launched Oryctes, developed with support from Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation, for precision spot spraying of rhinoceros beetles and other pests. It also recently launched Mist Drone, which blanket sprays open field crops, like paddies, corn and bananas. Most of the oil palm farms Poladrone works with are mid-to-large size, or about 5,000 hectares and above. “Data analytics and automation becomes extremely important for farms once they reach this scale,” Cheong said. He added that oil palm farms cover 18.7 million hectares around the world, and Poladrone sees a serviceable addressable market of 4.2 million hectares in Malaysia alone, worth over $1.3 billion per year. The company is also planning to expand its reach to other types of crops, like rice, corn and sugarcane. In addition to selling its products, Poladrone’s Service Centers also provide repairs, training and workshops, with the goal of increasing drone adoption. Cheong said it typically takes one week of training before workers start using Poladrone’s equipment, which can be operated from smartphones. In statement about investment, Wavemaker Partners general partner Gavin Lee said, “Poladrone now works with eight out of 10 of the biggest palm oil farms in Malaysia—an impressive feat that gives us confidence to back the team and their vision of propelling Southeast Asia’s agriculture industry.” Warehouse drones take flight",2021-10-26 03:11:37,"Rhinoceros beetles are one of the greatest threats to oil palm crops , attacking plants while they are young and potentially lowering a farm’s yield for years. They also affect workers’ health, since pesticides need to be sprayed frequently. Based in Kuala Lumpur, Poladrone wants to change the way farms use pesticides with a combination of drones and automation and analytics software. The company announced today it has raised a $4.29 million seed round led by Wavemaker Partners, which it says is the largest seed round ever raised in Malaysia, based on data from Crunchbase . Other participants include the Malaysian Technology Development Corporation (MTDC), which is wholly-owned by Khazanah Nasional Berhad, the Malaysian government’s sovereign wealth fund; ZB Capital Limited; and angel investors. Founded in 2016 by Cheong Jin Xi, Poladrone now operates in Malaysia and Thailand and plans to expand into Indonesia, the world’s largest oil palm producer. Cheong told TechCrunch that Poladrone is profitable, but decided to seek funding after the COVID-19 pandemic hit and “highlighted the positive impact our technology has on agriculture communities by creating jobs and upskilling opportunities.” Indonesian agritech platform TaniHub Group harvests a $65.5M Series B round Adoption of Poladrone’s drones also increased during labor shortages caused by the pandemic, and the startup grew its team from 20 people to over 80 in less than a year to meet demand. Its seed round will be used for more hiring and to scale operations and build more Service Centers in agricultural areas, where clients can buy equipment and spare parts. Cheong first became interested in drones when he was a high school student in Melbourne, Australia, and it led to him pursuing an aerospace engineering degree at university. After Cheong returned to Malaysia, he began looking at potential applications for drone technology and realized “the agriculture industry made perfect sense,” because drones can fly over large terrains to perform repetitive tasks autonomously, and their cameras also capture a large amount of data. Cheong’s interest in agritech was also inspired by growing up in Kuala Lipis, an agricultural town in the state of Pahang. Many of his family members and relatives are involved in farming, and his early insights went into the development of Poladrone’s products. Rhinoceros beetles are a serious problem during the first three years of an oil palm’s 25 year lifecycle, he said, because attacks hurt trees’ growth, delaying them from reaching maturity and sometimes killing plants. “The issue is that once the surrounding oil palms matures, replanting is no longer possible which means that any space wasted on a dead palm would be wasted for the next 22 years,” Cheong said. As a result, oil palm farms usually need to perform preventative pesticide spraying every two weeks for the first two years after oil palms are planted, then every month until they mature. This is often done by workers with knapsack sprayers or on tractors. One of Poladrone’s Service Centers In 2020, the company launched Oryctes , developed with support from Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation, for precision spot spraying of rhinoceros beetles and other pests. It also recently launched Mist Drone, which blanket sprays open field crops, like paddies, corn and bananas. Most of the oil palm farms Poladrone works with are mid-to-large size, or about 5,000 hectares and above. “Data analytics and automation becomes extremely important for farms once they reach this scale,” Cheong said.

Over the coming months, the US will be withdrawing its remaining troops from Iraq, currently standing at around 2,500. The withdrawal may also turn ugly and that the old threats may resurface. Indeed, the UN assesses that there are approximately 10,000 Daesh fighters in Syria and Iraq combined. The UN has warned that Daesh has been using the Covid-19 crisis to re-group and consolidate power in the region once again. Once the US withdraws completely, Daesh fighters may use the limbo to try to increase its power and influence in the territories as before. Thousands of Yazidis trapped in the Sinjar mountains as they tried to escape from Daesh in August ... [+] 2014. (Photo credit: Emrah Yorulmaz/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images) 2014 Anadolu Agency The world should not forget the atrocities perpetrated by Daesh fighters against religious minorities in Syria and Iraq in 2014 and in the years that followed. Those atrocities include murder, enslavement, deportation and forcible transfer of population, imprisonment, torture, abduction of women and children, exploitation, abuse, rape, sexual violence, sexual slavery and much more. The atrocities committed by Daesh are now recognized as crimes against humanity, war crimes and even genocide, the crime of crimes. The world cannot forget the particular wickedness of the atrocities. Video footage of beheadings, of kidnapped victims thrown from high buildings or burnt alive. These graphic images will be difficult to forget. Until this day, some 2,763 Yazidi women and children are still missing, whether in unknown location or dead. The UN has been warning about the ongoing threat posed by Daesh and its attempts to grow in power yet again, including by abusing the instability brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic. Despite the fact that Iraq declared victory over Daesh back in 2017, Daesh fighters have been present in the region in the years since. They continue to emerge periodically. Because of that, for example, in August 2021, Iraq launched a security operation to hunt down Daesh militants north of the capital Baghdad. Reportedly , Daesh militants “have an active presence in Tarmiyah district, 50 kilometers north of Baghdad, from where they launch attacks inside the Iraqi capital.” In early 2021, Alliance defense ministers have agreed to significantly raise the number of troops for the NATO Mission in Iraq, reportedly, from 500 to 4,000 . However, this is still far from the assessed number of Daesh fighters and their capability to recruit new members, as we have seen in 2013 and 2014. If the withdrawal from Iraq happens at the end of 2021, States must have a comprehensive action plan to prevent the disaster that we have witnessed in Afghanistan (mindful of the differences between the states but mindful of the risks involved). States must be ready to act to prevent the atrocities against religious minorities in Iraq, minorities which were subjected to genocidal atrocities only a few years ago. This is the time that States must act on the promise of Never Again and prevent avoidable atrocities against religious minorities.

A few dozen people were in the plaza outside the arena, some chanting “Let Kyrie play! Let Kyrie play!” and holding signs that said “Stand with Kyrie.” A small group even broke through barriers and got all the way to the front entrance of the arena about an hour before tipoff. Irving is not with the Nets because of his refusal to get vaccinated against COVID-19. A New York mandate requires professional athletes playing for a team in the city be vaccinated in order to play or practice in public venues. The Nets could have allowed Irving to play in road games, but they decided he wouldn’t be with the team until he could be a full participant. Irving explained during an Instagram Live post that he was doing “what’s best for me.” Protester Curtis Orwell said he and others were fighting for “bodily autonomy and sovereignty,” and the right to choose what goes in their bodies. “We also know so much more than we knew 18 months ago about the virus,” he said. “We have therapeutics that have been tried and proven to great success. Unfortunately, those kinds of voices are being totally suppressed and censored.” Orwell said he was not vaccinated and knew some people who had lost jobs because they weren’t. “It doesn’t feel right to them and that’s OK,” he said. “We need to respect that.” There were many empty seats in the arena as the game against the Charlotte Hornets was set to begin, though it was unclear if the commotion on the plaza caused it.

Kyrie Irving has been the talk of the NBA for several weeks now due to his unvaccinated status against COVID-19. He has stated on an Instagram live prior to the start of the 2021-22 NBA season that he isn’t anti-vax, rather, is anti-vaccine mandate. Irving feels people should be allowed to choose not to get the vaccine for personal reasons. Many believed that Kyrie Irving would cave as the season approached and would get the vaccine to play alongside his Brooklyn Nets teammates. A 1-2 record later for the Nets and there is absolutely nothing on the Kyrie Irving front in terms of when he could possibly return.

Nets fans protest against Kyrie Irving not being allowed to play. The Nets home opener didn’t go exactly as planned as the Kevin Durant-led squad lost by 16 points to the Charlotte Hornets as Mile Bridges dropped yet another 30 points, with LaMelo ball having 18 points of his own. KD did his thing however, scoring 38 points on 71% shooting from the field. What has become the story for the night regarding the Nets unfortunately, is the fact that Nets fans chanted, “Let Kyrie Irving play!” and “Stand with Kyrie!” along with “No vaccine mandate!”. The scene eventually got out of hand and resulted in fans pushing against the barricades near Barclays Center in protest against the mandate.

Blak...,"NEW YORK (AP) — Andrew Mangiapane scored twice and the Calgary Flames beat the New York Rangers 5-1 on Monday night for their third straight win. Blake Coleman and Mikael Backlund each had a goal and an assist, and Christopher Tanev also scored for Calgary. Johnny Gaudreau got his seventh assist of the season and Jacob Markstrom stopped 28 shots. Dryden Hunt scored for the Rangers, who had won four straight — all on the road. Igor Shesterkin, making his fifth start, finished with 32 saves. Trailing 2-0 after 40 minutes, the Rangers got on the scoreboard early in the third period. Markstrom stopped the initial shot by Jacob Trouba, but Hunt corralled a rebound in front and put it past the goalie for his first of the season at 5:25. Coleman restored Calgary’s two-goal lead less than three minutes later as he backhanded the rebound of his own shot past Shesterkin for his second. Backlund made it 4-1 with 8 1/2 minutes left as he scored into the top left corner from the right circle for his first. Mangiapane got his second of the night, scoring on a rebound on the power play from the right side with just over five seconds remaining. It was his fifth of the season and 10th in his last nine games, dating to last season. Leading 1-0 after one period, the Flames doubled their lead early in the second. Mangiapane intercepted a pass by Patrik Nemeth from behind the Rangers net and beat Shesterkin from the right side at 2:09. Mika Zibanejad had a chance to get the Rangers on the scoreboard after a Flames turnover as he skated up the ice with Alexis Lafreniere, but was denied by Markstorm with about 6 1/2 minutes left in the middle period. Shesterkin made a nice glove stop on a slap shot by Tyler Pitlick about 40 seconds later. Markstrom stopped a wraparound try by Trouba with just more than two minutes to go, and then denied his backhand follow. Calgary outshot New York 15-7 in the first period. Shesterkin’s best save of the period came on an attempt by Sean Monahan in front with 3:15 remaining after a giveaway by the goalie. Tanev got the Flames on the scoreboard on a rush with 1:10 left in the opening period as he got a pass from Gaudreau and beat Shesterkin from the right circle on the glove side for his first of the season. Elias Lindholm got his first assist and seventh point on the play. The Rangers were down two players for much of the first. Rugged forward Ryan Reaves went to the dressing room early in the period after an apparent injury to his left leg, and defenseman Ryan Lindgren joined him by the midpoint after blocking a shot with his foot. Lindgren was back on the bench late in the period, and returned to the ice in the second. Reaves was also on the bench at the start of the second, but did not play again. SPECIAL TEAMS The Rangers went 0 for 2 on the power play and are 3 for 26 this season. … The Flames were 1 for 2 with the man advantage, improving to 3 for 14. LINEUPS Ryan Strome returned to the Rangers’ lineup after missing the four-game road trip due to COVID-19 protocols. He started on a line with Artemi Panarin and Barclay Goodrow. Morgan Barron was sent to Hartford of the AHL to make room for Strome. Injured forward Kappo Kakko is still out and coach Gerard Gallant said Kakko could return Friday.

This is the mechanism we use, so if anything happens, like infection cases, the agent will be held responsible,” she said when answering questions from the media at an event at the Malaysia Tourism Centre (Matic) here today.She was queried whether the government would take similar steps as Singapore and Thailand in limiting tourist arrivals.She was met at the presentation of Financial Assistance and Contributions to 15 non-governmental organisations and 20 arts practitioners at Matic here today.The international tourism bubble, she said, was introduced to help the economy recover from the negative impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic, adding that the government could not afford to wait for too long to reopen the tourism sector to foreign tourists as it would cause locals to lose their jobs.“So we need to think rationally and consider the steps that can be taken for the benefit of all.“Also, the developments in Langkawi can become a model for us to examine tourist behaviour in helping curb the spread of Covid-19,” she said.She said since the recent announcement regarding the tourism travel bubble, many homestays in Langkawi have received bookings from tourists, especially from Europe.The international tourism travel bubble for Langkawi, is slated to begin on November 15, was announced by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob last Friday. — Bernama",2021-10-25 11:40:51,,,malaymail,"[('KUALA LUMPUR', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY')]",0.1,0.1,1.0

Bill Roache offered ‘six figure’ contract to stay in Coronation Street ahead of huge milestone,https://metro.co.uk/2021/10/24/coronation-street-bill-roache-offered-six-figure-contract-to-stay-15479648/,"['Coronation Street', 'ITV', 'Ken Barlow', 'William Roache']",['Charlotte Manning'],,He's been in the soap since 1960.,"Actor Bill Roache turns 90 next year (Picture: ITV) Coronation Street’s Ken Barlow has been on the streets of Weatherfield since the show started in 1960 and it luckily seems actor Bill Roache is going nowhere just yet. It’s hard to imagine the ITV show without the inclusion of Ken, who’s been at the heart of the soap for decades. While the actor will turn 90 in April, there’s no sign of him slowing down from his role on the cobbles as it’s been reported bosses have offered him a new deal to stay on the soap. According to The Daily Star, execs are looking to sign him up for another year in a bumper deal worth six figures. A source told the publication: ‘Bill is a huge part of Coronation Street and they know how much the fans adore him. Ken waved goodbye to Norris Cole on the cobbles this year (Picture: ITV) ‘They love the idea of marking his 90th birthday with a great storyline. ‘Bill may be pushing 90 but he still has the energy, passion and talent that make him soap’s greatest-ever actor.’ Bill’s current contract reportedly ends later this year and there are plans for a major storyline to mark the occasion of the actor’s 90th birthday if he stays put.

It’s hard to imagine the ITV show without the inclusion of Ken, who’s been at the heart of the soap for decades. While the actor will turn 90 in April, there’s no sign of him slowing down from his role on the cobbles as it’s been reported bosses have offered him a new deal to stay on the soap. According to The Daily Star , execs are looking to sign him up for another year in a bumper deal worth six figures. A source told the publication: ‘Bill is a huge part of Coronation Street and they know how much the fans adore him. ‘They love the idea of marking his 90th birthday with a great storyline. ‘Bill may be pushing 90 but he still has the energy, passion and talent that make him soap’s greatest-ever actor.’ Bill’s current contract reportedly ends later this year and there are plans for a major storyline to mark the occasion of the actor’s 90 th birthday if he stays put.

The individuals caught novel coronavirus via close contact, Algoma Public Health reported late Sunday afternoon. Both are self-isolating. This brings the total number of confirmed cases to 503 since March 2020. Twenty-four cases are active as of early Sunday evening. There are currently no COVID-19 hospitalizations. There have been eight deaths in Algoma District, the most recent reported last Tuesday. Algoma Public Health reported Saturday an individual associated with the YMCA before and after school program, McNabb site, has tested positive for COVID-19. APH says if families from the program do not receive a low risk and/or high risk contact letter, their child is not considered a close contact of the person who tested positive for COVID-19, in which case APH does not recommend having their child tested unless they are showing symptoms of COVID-19. Algoma Public Health is working with that specific YMCA program and child-are centre to review and confirm “important practices” to reduce the potential spread of COVID-19. APH is conducting a “careful” investigation to identify close contacts. Examples of close contacts include household members, people who have been in direct physical contact or belong to the same classroom/cohort, and people who have spent more than 15 minutes together within two metres or six feet of each other, such as while sharing a meal. Brief interactions, such as walking past someone in a hallway are not generally considered close contact situations. APH will notify all low- and high-risk contacts via letter to provide further guidance and direction. Meanwhile, Ontario reported 492 new cases of COVID-19 on Friday, and 11 more deaths. Health Minister Christine Elliott said 325 of those cases are in people not fully vaccinated or their vaccination status is unknown. There are 149 people in intensive care units due to COVID-19, with 128 of them who are not fully vaccinated or have an unknown vaccination status. Meanwhile, Ontario reported 370 new cases of COVID-19 and one new related death Sunday ahead of lightened restrictions Monday, including the removal of capacity limits for restaurants, bars and gyms. There are 138 people hospitalized due to the virus and 137 in the ICU with COVID-related illnesses. Health Minister Christine Elliott noted in a Twitter post Sunday that not all hospitals report their numbers on weekends. Elliott said of the 370 new cases, 247 are in individuals who are not fully vaccinated or have unknown vaccination status, and 123 are in fully vaccinated individuals. Another 480 cases are now considered resolved. There have been 597,515 cases in Ontario since the pandemic began and 9,846 deaths. In the capital area, the Eastern Ontario health unit, which contains Cornwall, saw seven new cases while the Kingston area saw five. Renfrew County had one new case, and no new cases were reported in Leeds, Grenville, Lanark region. There is one new outbreak in a long-term care home, making for a total of six ongoing outbreaks in that type of facility. There are four active outbreaks in retirement homes and three in hospitals. The province has administered 22,385,190 total vaccine doses. Almost 87.9 per cent of the eligible population has at least one dose, while just over 83.8 per cent are fully vaccinated. — with files from Postmedia Network",,saultstar,[],0.4,0.0,0.9

Trudeau has long sought a trade deal with the 10-nation bloc, which includes the Philippines, Indonesia, Brunei, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Burma. He told a virtual business summit organized by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations that a free trade agreement with Canada would be a “win-win” for all sides, particularly coming out of the pandemic. Speaking in a pre-recorded message, Trudeau argued that an agreement with ASEAN would help companies and entrepreneurs build connections and business relationships around the world. He also said a pact would give investors more confidence to invest in international markets, and protect supply chains from the uncertainties brought by COVID-19. Trade bottlenecks across the globe have been slower to recover than consumer demand for goods, and slowed further by ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks and public health measures. All this affects inventories of in-demand consumer products or the delivery of parts needed to build things like cars, and pushes up transportation costs that get passed on to consumers, which is reflected in higher inflation rates. “As we finish the fight against COVID-19, deepening our ties with ASEAN economies and diversifying trade across the Asia-Pacific will play a crucial role in our recovery,” Trudeau said in his address. “My friends, a strong Canada-ASEAN relationship is a clear win-win for all of our businesses and all of our people.” The economies of the 10-nation bloc as a group represent Canada’s sixth largest trading partner, but the country already has access to four ASEAN members — Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam — through a Pacific Rim trade pact known as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). The Liberals’ election platform promised a new hub to help businesses take advantage of opportunities under CPTPP, and a new Asia-Pacific strategy aimed at deepening ties in the region, including new trade deals. A preliminary analysis by ASEAN and the federal government on the merits of a free trade deal estimated Canadian exports of goods and services to the bloc could go up by 13.3 per cent, valued at US$2.67 billion In his address, Trudeau said both sides must also ensure women, Indigenous people, LGBTQ entrepreneurs, visible minorities and other under-represented business owners get involved in and benefit from trade.

Mary May Simon received the symbolic first poppy Monday as the Royal Canadian Legion launched this year’s annual national fundraising campaign for veterans ahead of Remembrance Day. May Simon accepted the poppy from Legion dominion president Bruce Julian during a ceremony at Rideau Hall in which attendees noted that this year also marks the 100th anniversary of the poppy having been adopted as a symbol of remembrance. Anna Guerin of France is credited with having first proposed the poppy as a symbol of the horrible costs and sacrifices of war in the aftermath of the First World War. Guerin drew inspiration from In Flanders Fields, the moving poem written during the war by lieutenant-colonel John McCrae and which continues to be read at Remembrance Day ceremonies across Canada and other parts of the world each year. The Great War Veterans’ Association of Canada officially adopted the poppy symbol in 1921, and the iconic flower has been worn in the weeks leading up to the annual ceremony ever since. Donations collected during the fundraising campaign are used to support various Legion programs for veterans, including emergency food and shelter as well as bursaries, disaster relief and remembrance activities.

Delay in BPCL sale likely as suitors find no partners,https://www.thehansindia.com/business/delay-in-bpcl-sale-likely-as-suitors-find-no-partners-712467,"['Business,Today NewsPaper']",['The Hans India'],,"The 3 suitors-Vedanta Group, Apollo Global Management and I Squared Capital-talking to global energy giants and sovereign and pension funds, but haven’t been able to finalize partners","Delay in BPCL sale likely as suitors find no partnersDelay in BPCL sale likely as suitors find no partnersIndia's plan to privatize Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) has run into rough weather with bidders struggling to find partners and spread their financial risks, according to people familiar with the matter.The three suitors - the Vedanta group, Apollo Global Management and I Squared Capital - are talking to global energy giants and sovereign and pension funds, but haven't been able to finalize partners, the people said, asking not to be identified as the deliberations are private. Some bidders are finding it difficult to invest due to sustainability rules that make it tougher for them to buy a stake in an oil refiner, some of the people said. The fresh hurdle to sell the government's entire stake could temper some of the euphoria generated by the recent sale of Air India Ltd to the Tata Group and slow down the nation's biggest privatization drive. The sale of the state-run refiner-cum-fuel retailer would have fetched about $13 billion for the exchequer and other shareholders. BPCL shares fell 3.5 per cent to Rs 431.7 at the close in Mumbai, the most in more than a month, following the Bloomberg News report. The massive price tag means bidders as well as the Indian government want a consortium with stronger technical and financial muscle for the transaction, the people said. Spokesmen at the finance ministry and BPCL weren't immediately available for a comment, while Apollo Global declined to comment. Representatives at Vedanta and I Squared didn't reply to emails seeking comment. India Still Hopes Oil Majors Will Join Race for Biggest Sale.A global push toward green energy and pressure from investors to slash emissions is holding back companies from making large investments in fossil fuels. The pandemic and its fallout has also delayed the process and discouraged global firms from committing big investments in traditional fuels. For BPCL, the bidders have been slow in conducting due diligence as they wait for new partners to join, the people said. That will likely upend the federal government's aim to complete selling its entire 53 per cent holding in BPCL by the end of this financial year in March, for which it had planned to seek financial bids next month. BPCL allowed bidders virtual access to its financial data early April, but it hasn't progressed beyond exchange of a few queries and some initial discussions with the state-run company's management in the past six months. ""Bidders are conducting due diligence, but uncertainty over the bidder consortium and process complexity, including valuation, may lead to potential delays,"" Fitch Ratings Ltd. said in a commentary last month. ""We believe the risks of further Covid-19 waves and global oil and gas companies' increased focus on energy transition lead to additional uncertainty over the timing and valuation of potentially large acquisitions in the sector."" BPCL has three refineries that can process about 700,000 barrels of oil daily, a marketing network of almost 19,000 fuel stations and close to 6,200 liquefied petroleum gas distributors.

"B.C. restaurants, food sector struggling with staffing as COVID-19 measures ease",https://vancouver.citynews.ca/2021/10/25/bc-restaurants-staffing-capacity/,,['Hana Mae Nassar'],,"While capacity limits have been lifted in parts of B.C. for a number of businesses, you may still find yourself waiting while out for a bite or drink.","While capacity limits have been lifted in parts of B.C. for a number of businesses and gatherings, you may still find yourself waiting while out for a bite or drink. According to the Alliance of Beverage Licensees, the industry is still facing a number of challenges, though the scaling back of COVID-19 measures is welcome news. “We estimate we’re about 40,000 workers short right now. So, if you’re out there and you’re wondering why it takes longer to get service at your favourite restaurant, bar, or pub, we’re struggling with that as well. We’re doing the best we can with inadequate staffing,” explained Jeff Guignard, ABLE BC executive director. The staffing shortage, he says, is expected to be a longer term challenge, with a few factors adding to struggles. “The hospitality industry has relied upon foreign workers in a lot of places,” he explained, pointing to travel measures brought on by the pandemic, through which many countries moved to shut down borders to non-essential travel to limit the spread of the virus. Related articles: B.C.’s capacity limits lifted on restaurants, arenas, concerts, and more B.C. event planners, tourism industry looking forward to lifted capacity limits B.C. doctors group opposes lifting COVID-19-related capacity limits on events Second, Guignard notes the sector was “essentially shut down” for about a year, meaning many people lost their jobs. Many of them went on to find new employment. Finally, he says there are the select few who have been taking advantage of federal and provincial aid programs, despite many businesses paying more. “Yes, sometimes that comes with costs for us as well, and we’re in a low-margin business that’s been losing money for a while, so we do have to pass off some of those costs to customers, of course, and we’re hoping everyone will be understanding about that.” The food services and hospitality sectors have been hard hit through the pandemic, with many businesses operating at an overall loss over the past year. Guignard says everyone is anxious to get back to normal. “We wish these steps were going faster,” he admitted on Monday. “But at the end of the day, today is really good news for our industry.” As of Monday, there are no longer capacity restrictions for venues that require proof of vaccination in many parts of the province, meaning businesses are able to fill their establishments to 100 per cent capacity if they are checking for B.C. Vaccine Cards. As part of the scaling back of COVID-19 measures, patrons are able to now mingle between tables, no longer being forced to stay in their seats while out. Venues are allowed to determine their own table limits, and there are no longer any restrictions on liquor sale hours. Measures still remain However, some measures remain. People are still required to wear masks in indoor public spaces, dancing is still not permitted, and full vaccination is required to access certain non-essential businesses, services, and events. Pandemic rules are also not being relaxed across the province. Regional restrictions remain for the Interior Health, Northern Health, and Fraser East regions due to high COVID-19 case numbers and low vaccination rates. “We’ve been losing money, we’ve barely broken even for the past 18 to 20 months,” said Guignard of struggles the industry has faced. “All of these restrictions have, accidentally, been really borne by the hospitality industry, people on the frontlines, right? We haven’t been able to host events properly, we haven’t been able to be at full capacity, we’ve had to check vaccine passports and so many of those things, which has been difficult.” He believes the lifting of restrictions is a step in the right direction. However, he says there are still some challenges workers and businesses will have to navigate, pointing to the dancing restrictions and their impacts on places like nightclubs. “It’s been very difficult to help customers understand, especially now that everyone’s double vaccinated … why you can’t dance,” Guignard explained. “We’ve got back to standing and mingling, that’s a good step, and I think we’ll get back to dancing fairly soon. Even just the simple fact of allowing people to stand up is taking tremendous pressure off staff who have had to go around the room over, and over, and over again to remind people they’re not allowed to stand.” -With files from Claire Fenton",2021-10-25 17:56:15,,https://vancouver.citynews.ca/wp-content/blogs.dir/sites/9/2021/05/21/Restauraunts-indoors-Vancouver-1024x580.png,citynews1130,[],0.0,0.9,0.0

I’m hella sensitive, but I’ll never show it. I got way too much pride. I got pride out the window. I’m pretty much all of that, if I had to describe myself real quick. Top 5 DOA:It’s not in no order, but Biggie, Jay-Z, Lil Wayne, and… I'm not gonna lie and it's early to be saying bro, but Brent Faiyaz is one of my favorite artists right now. I feel like people would have listened to him in the 80s and 90s. No matter where you threw him, I feel like his music would’ve worked. Good music don’t fade, so I'll give him that. And then I'm putting myself in there. I don’t be giving myself enough credit. I really like my own music, so I'm gonna throw myself in there.[If I couldn’t include myself, it would be] my favorite, Stevie Wonder— or Michael Jackson, of course. I don't really count Michael Jackson because to me, that's the greatest of all time. He don't even get compared to nobody. So Michael Jackson out the gate, but I put Stevie Wonder in there. He’s another one of them dudes. I ain’t even gonna use Stevie Wonder because I look at Stevie Wonder too high. Top five dead or alive, at the end, for five is Kanye, like Late Registration Kanye. That was my favorite Ye.As I got older, I just started to realize that Biggie makes great songs. From the samples to what he’s talking about, to how he’s flowing. He’s a picture painter. That sh*t is dope. I admire that. Jay— it’s Jay, bro. [Laughs] C’mon, man. Wayne’s hard. Wayne does so much. I feel like you could put Wayne on any type of beat, and he would never get boxed in. He can make a song that'll be a hit for him. All the mixtape shit he did was amazing. Brent— like I was saying, just throw him anywhere. It’s gonna work. Ye was my favorite. It kind of took a turn for me when the music started changing, like ""808s & Heartbreaks"" and sh*t like that, but I always respected it. It was always a different type of music. I love it because it's Ye, but I'm a product of my environment. I need to hear what I'm going through. That was what I was looking for: sh*t that I can relate to. So, it took a turn for me. I stopped listening to him as much. I always give him a listen. You couldn't stop me from listening to Kanye West. I used to try to dress like Kanye West. Kanye is the best ever, n****— producer and rapper. All them albums was just him being himself and pouring his emotions into the music, but it’s still uplifting. It's hard for people to do that. I strive to do that. I strive to still make you smile, no matter what I'm saying. I strive to make you feel emotions. I want this song to make you feel good. I want this song to make you feel sad. I want this song to make you think. Even if he wasn't doing it on purpose, that’s what I got from his music. That's the impact it had on me. Ye is one of the greatest to ever do it, all-time. Biggest Accomplishment:It’s probably gonna sound crazy, but just being able to make money. I’ve been doing music for so long for nothing— not for nothing, but just to be able to do this. Being able to make money is beautiful. So many people -- it’s these people's passion. They put so much into it — so much time, so much effort, so much money — and they don't receive anything out of this. I feel hella blessed that this is all I have to do: to make music. Right now, I’m fortunate enough to take care of myself. I take care of other people. That’s the blessing within it all. This is my job at the end of the day. My job is to be myself as much as I can. I can't trade that for the world. Ain’t nobody get to go to work as happy as me. I promise you. This sh*t is happy. Even when I'm mad, I'm happy, because I'm mad about asking for more. That's usually what I'm mad about. I'm already doing well. I'm cool. Aye man, it was this or UPS. [Laughs]Studio Habits & Essentials:I'm gonna say, “Do y'all f*ck with that?” like 1000 times. That's weird. It gets to the point where homies be like, “Bro, don't ask us nothing. Just keep recording. Don't say nothing. Yes, we f*ck with it. Everybody in here nodding their head. You don't got to ask us, ‘Do we f*ck with it?’”  And then sometimes, I'll make the engineer put the headphones on so can’t nobody hear it. They get mad when I do that. And 3 things I need in the studio… weed. That’s the first one. Definitely don't want to be in the studio and not be high. I don't got to get high to make music, but I would rather be high. That's cool for me. I get a lot done. If it's a late session, I need my blanket so I can curl up and listen to the music after it's done. And snacks. The snacks gotta be superior. If we send you to go get snacks, and you come back and strike out, we probably won't even smoke with you. That snack sh*t is serious. You gotta have the right snacks. The last time we went to ‘yo, we didn’t even have the right snacks. My cousin ordered some Wingstop and got naked chicken. I ain’t never seen no chicken with no seasoning— just plain chicken! That n**** crazy.[The worst snack run] I think we was in the studio in Atlanta, and n**** brought back some sunflower seeds or something like that. I'm like, “Bro, what the f*ck?” [Laughs] Some almonds or something. That’s wasn’t it, bro. You didn't get the right sh*t.TwoFr 2:From what everybody say, it’s going good. And there's always room for improvement. Honestly, I love it. I love the response I'm getting. I'm getting booked for shows, people really listening to the music, my streams going up every week. I’m extremely appreciative, and I'm appreciative that so many people rock with the music, but I'm just excited to do it again. I have so much more music. I'm working so hard. I work so much. I just want to show everybody what I got, and hopefully, just get bigger and bigger every time. With the “Hoochie Hotline”, it was gonna be a quick EP, and it was gonna be more songs catered towards women. We swapped a lot of the songs out. We added a bunch of songs. It was really a feeling. It was more, “Man, it’s time for TwoFr 2.” I was having that feeling that I had when I dropped ""TwoFr,"" and that was the tape that took off, that started my music stuff, with “Right Wit It”, and “Finance”, and “Naked”. That’s what started up my name, started making me a household name, actually putting some rank on it. So just doubling back around— this time, bigger platform, bigger music, everything's growing. I’m more mature now. I'm more mature as an artist. I've learned so much more out of being in so many situations, met people. It was just time. I had to go with what I knew. I can’t explain the feeling, but I had the feeling again. It felt like ""TwoFr,"" so it was time to go in.With Blue Bucks, them the homies. We have been recording. We have been supposed to get in the studio, been recording. Even if we don't record, we still pull up on each other. I was just like, “Bro, I got one. I’m finna put this sh*t on my tape.” Them n***** pulled up on me and knocked it out. With the song with Durk, that wasn't the original song I wanted to put Durk on. I’m blessed because I have so many other good people around me, so many people that are interested in music and have a music background. They were like, “Nah, maybe you should put him on ‘I Like.’” That was all them. That didn’t even have nothing to do with me. So we sent bro the song, bro got on there, worked it in. But me and Durk have already had music together. I f*ck with them OTF n***** heavy. We got locked in. It was cool. I be running into Durk everyday at the studio, so it ain’t nothing to get stuff done with them. Bro was f*cking with the record, too. It was dope.First Bars:It probably was something stupid, something weak. I remember I used to try to rap when I was really little, and it was horrible. [Laughs] It just wasn’t it. But it was probably something about 24-inch rims. My cousin had 24-inch rims on his Denali. So it probably was that. He used to take me to school in the morning sometimes. I used to feel cool as hell getting out.  He had the XL Denali, the big, long ass one, so it was probably something about that. But it was sorry, whatever it was. [Laughs]My first time ever recording was in the garage. My cousin and his homies made music for fun. He played in the league, but he used to make music. My cousin Kenan. He'd be making music with his friends. I had to be like 10, and I was like, “Let me make a song.” He was like, “Alright, you gotta do everything yourself,” so he made me make the beat, made me make the song. I did everything. I made the beat on Reason, and I recorded the song on Pro Tools. I did it with an MPC. Sh*t, that’s when I fell in love.He was walking me through [ProTools and Reason] but he made me do it myself. He was like, “I'm not finna do it for you. Drag that there.” I had rhythm and sh*t like that. I had a feel for what I was doing. I knew what I wanted to do. That's when I was into Kanye West like heavy. I was up on what was going on. I was probably in sixth grade when that sh*t happened. My garage was my studio until ""TwoFr."" I did ""TwoFr"" in my garage. I did half of it in Atlanta, and I did the other half right here in my garage. I remember doing a song with Slimmy B. All my homies was in the garage. That was my first time doing a feature with somebody that was bigger than me. Somebody I didn’t know. I had done sh*t with Jay and all of that, 1Take, and he was blowing up in the city. But that was my homie. We don’t look at it like that when that’s your homie. But that n**** Slimmy, I’m in the studio. Couple days later, that n**** was texting me. He sent me a song. I didn’t have nothing going. Playing the song back after I recorded it in the garage with all the homies, they’re like, “Man, that’s hard.” I was looking back like, “Man, that sh*t was tight,” like you’re doing shit now! All my homies were recording the garage, like me, Phabo. Phabo cut a gang of records. He’s new from Soulection. We be running through here making music. First Show:My first show was at a club in San Diego called F6. My dawg Junior used to run the club on Thursday nights. I was buying a hoverboard from bro in the parking lot at the crib. I was playing some music. The homie was playing my music out of the car because I had been recording little songs when I was in college, and I used to just be freestyling on sh*t. The homie’s playing my music. He was like, “What's that?"" I'm like, “Sh*t, that's me. I be rapping.” He’s like, “Yeah?” I'm like, “Yeah, I be getting little views and sh*t like that. I play football for real, but I be rapping on the side.” He’s like, “If you ever want to perform, come to the club. I could set it up on a Thursday night.” Thursday nights be cool. I told all my homies that I had a show, and I posted it. They made me a flyer. Everybody came out at my school. Everybody I f*cked with at my school came, all the sports— basketball, football, soccer, the girls that play tennis. The line was wrapped around the club because it was so many of us, the people that were supporting me. It was lit. We packed the whole club. I only had two songs. I performed two songs like five times, and it was just rocking. It was going up, and from there on out. I was like, “Alright, let me start doing music.” Then a couple months after that, I opened up for Young Thug, and that was my real first performance at a concert venue. It was at the Observatory in San Diego. I f*cking stage-dived, and they caught me. I was like, “I want to be a rapper.” I was brought in at that point, like, “Oh my god, you stage dived.” That sh*t crazy. So that was a n**** first show.Clocking Out:Man, I watch ""Good Girls."" It’s one of my favorite shows. I be embarrassed to say it, but that's a real good show. I've met the security guard from the show. That's my homie now. I met him in the Gucci store. And I was like, “Hey, bro, you’re on Good Girls!"" He was like, “What?” Like, what the f*ck? You watch that show? I was like, “On god, that's my sh*t.” I started talking to bro about the show. We ended up being real cool. His name is Caleb [Tyler]. He ended up coming to my show at the Novo and everything right after that. I ended up making a buddy out of that. It was crazy, but I really f*ck with that show. I watch a lot of TV. TV is amazing. TV right now is really good. I see why people in the 90s were so into TV because it was actually following what was going on in their time period. Now I'm an adult, and I actually know what's going on in the world. It’s different from watching it as a kid because you don't really know. When you were a teenager, you didn't really know what was going on. You just watch the shows, but now, I can actually relate. And then on top of that, I'm making music now, and I'm actually becoming somebody, so I'm knowing people. I'm knowing the n***** in these shows, seeing n***** in the club. I’m going to the gym, seeing n***** in the gym. I’m playing in celebrity all-star games with people. My life crazy. If I had to sum it all up, this sh*t crazy. I could never have imagined living like this.Up Next:Going on tour. We already finished the TwoFr tour. It was my first headlining tour ever, so I'm extremely excited. I’ve been working out, getting in a little tour mode. I just want to make sure I'm putting on a great show. I want to leave a good taste in everybody's mouth. That sounded crazy. I just want everybody to f*ck with the show. I want everybody to love it. I want to take my showmanship seriously. That's the difference between a lot of artists— people who just be standing up on stage and looking around. I want to make sure I get out of that bubble, graduate from that and actually put a show on. I hope people are excited. I don't think that people are expecting what I got planned. Finna take it through the roof.Image provided by the artistHNHH: What do you think of the current state of LA Hip-Hop? And do you think there's a time of the past that this era feels similar to? Kalan.FrFr: I don't feel like it's ever been like anything. There are so many of us that really f*ck with each other. I don't think I've ever seen it like this — that all people that aren't from the same label, or from the same clique, or from the same group. We all from different areas, different pockets in LA, but we all come together to make sh*t happen. Everybody knows about each other because of everybody. You know what I mean? It reminds me of Atlanta, how they got sh*t going on out there. We still working out the kinks and stuff, but from this generation, everybody's messing with everybody right now. It be a little politics here and there, but for the most part, people support each other. It's nothing better than that, and we lack a lot of that in LA, so I'm glad that it's getting better. I would say it's getting way better.Whenever I listened — at least when I listened to TwoFr 2 — I noticed you mention your grandma a lot. Talk to me a little bit about her influence on your music.She influences my life. I never want to let her down. I slept in a bed with my grandmother until the moment she passed away. She died in a bed with me. It’s a connection. I feel connected to her. I can just talk to her, and damn near feel like somebody’s saying something back to me. I got to do this sh*t. I got to be the best at it. I gotta make that sh*t work. Before my grandma died, she just told me, “You could do it.” She always told me I’m a star. She was always telling me, “whatever you want to do, just do it. You could do anything.” She would sit up and watch me act like Michael Jackson for an hour, then come in the backyard and watch me play football by myself, throwing the ball up in the air. Throwing me the ball so I could play football. Like, my grandma playing catch with me and shit like that. Different shit like that. Riding my bike. Watch me go and ride my bike, helping me make a ramp in the front yard. My mama was working, so I was with my grandma all the time. Anything I ever wanted to do, she made it okay for me to do it.  A lot of things that people, in general, are lacking, starts as a child, and it starts with your parents, and it determines what you can be, how big you dream. A lot of people's parents and the world limit a lot of people's dreams, telling people what they can and cannot do and what they can and cannot be. I've never felt like I couldn't be nothing. Realistically, I knew I wasn't gonna be the president. I don't even like school. How the fuck am I gonna be president? I'm not interested in that. But if I was, I could. And if I couldn’t, then it wasn't for me. I never look at myself as a failure for trying something, because I tried, and I’mma always getting something out of it. You are always gonna get something out of something you trying. And if you not, and you continue to do it, you’re insane. That's literally the definition of insanity. My grandma, she just sit on me. She in my heart. People would think I'm crazy. I'll sit up and be talking like, “Granny, I got to do this sh*t.” They’re like, “Who are you talking to?” I can just feel her with me all the time. It's a spiritual thing. So Jay-Z calls and he gets you to sign with Roc Nation. What's the best advice he's been able to give you so far? We ain’t really had too many one-on-ones. During COVID, nobody was in the office, and then I'm from LA. Everybody's in New York. I'm just now starting to meet bro. Every time I see him, we be around a gang of people. There don’t be too much time, so I haven’t had my one-on-ones will bro yet. But when the time do come, I’ll let you know.That’s a mad surreal moment, going from listening to him in your headphones to meeting him.I didn't even know he was that tall, bro. That n**** tall. I had looked up like, “Damn.” He’s like a hooper. He got hooper size on him. That sh*t was shocking, seeing him in the office. I really admire bro, so this sh*t dope.Obviously, you’re such a fan of Kanye as well. Signing to Jay, did you ever acknowledge that parallel with Kanye’s career?Hell yeah. I posted a picture a couple months ago saying I was a Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer of the Roc. I been eating that sh*t up. That whole Kanye album with Jay talking at the end of it. Fuck you, Kanye, first and foremost. That's a dream. I would love to have Jay-Z talking at the end of my song. He don’t even got to do a feature, just say something. Who don't want that? I for sure have made the comparison, but I would never compare myself to Kanye. I’m my own guy. It’s just to have my own imagination of all of that sh*t when I was a child listening to it for the first time, and being a kid and wondering how it happened. Then thinking, “Damn, I was just with Jay-Z.” That's crazy. Like I said earlier, my life— it’s all new to me. In five years, this conversation—God willing—will be totally different. I'll be like, “Man, Jay was just over here tripping the other day at the house. We was eating crab legs. That's my n****.” But right now, this is all new to me, and I love it. Everything that comes with it, I love it.",2021-10-25 17:17:39,"Rise & Grind is a brand new editorial series, meant to introduce and dissect new, buzzing, or underground artists. Los Angeles has a hub of inspiration for music relating to the struggle, but there’s always been a balance highlighting the beauty of California. Women, weed, and weather, as Dr. Dre said on Kendrick Lamar ’s “The Recipe.” Kalan.FrFr is highlighting all those aspects. The melodies he brings speak to love and heartbreak while the guttural side of his artistry can easily soundtrack a good time. The rapper is riding high off of the release of Two.Fr 2 -- the official follow-up to his 2018 predecessor. It was a concerted choice that came after joking with the idea of using Hoochie Hotline as the title of his next project. While some of the songs did end up making it on to Two.Fr2 , the Roc Nation-signed artist explained that it felt like the right time to double back to the project that established his name. “I’m more mature now. I'm more mature as an artist,” he says. “It was just time. I had to go with what I knew. I can’t explain the feeling, but I had the feeling again. It felt like TwoFr , so it was time to go in.” With songs like “Never Lose You” having a grip on summer 2021, the future is looking quite promising for Kalan.FrFr. The rapper is hitting the road this fall for the Two Fr tour alongside Haiti Babi, Kyle Banks, and Jehkai. We chopped it up with Kalan.FrFr for the latest installment in Rise & Grind about his latest project, his love for Kanye West , and more. Stay tuned for a new installment of Rise & Grind every Monday. I'm from Carson, California and Compton. I grew up in both. My mom stayed in Carson, and my dad stayed in Compton, so I was always hella back and forth. But now I'm from all over. I represent all of LA, from the East Side to the West. I lived in all these places, and I got so much family. I’m a real LA native, all the way around. 100%. It's not really all that different [growing up between Compton and Carson] because pretty much everybody in all of these communities know each other. My cousins would be over there, I would go down, and they’d come over here, come hang out with me. Then, by the time we all started playing sports and going to junior high school and high school, everybody knew each other. I'm an Aries. I've been told that I’m every bit an Aries. Everything that they got to say about it, I’m a lot of. I ain’t a liar, though. I’m one of the cooler Aries. I be hearing a lot of Aries are liars. I don’t be lying. There ain’t no need to lie. I got past that, whatever that stage was. I’m loud as hell. You can't stop me from being loud. I’mma always feel offended. I always think somebody's trying to offend me, 100%.

I be running into Durk everyday at the studio, so it ain’t nothing to get stuff done with them. Bro was f*cking with the record, too. It was dope. It probably was something stupid, something weak. I remember I used to try to rap when I was really little, and it was horrible. [Laughs] It just wasn’t it. But it was probably something about 24-inch rims. My cousin had 24-inch rims on his Denali. So it probably was that. He used to take me to school in the morning sometimes. I used to feel cool as hell getting out. He had the XL Denali, the big, long ass one, so it was probably something about that. But it was sorry, whatever it was. [Laughs] My first time ever recording was in the garage. My cousin and his homies made music for fun. He played in the league, but he used to make music. My cousin Kenan. He'd be making music with his friends. I had to be like 10, and I was like, “Let me make a song.” He was like, “Alright, you gotta do everything yourself,” so he made me make the beat, made me make the song. I did everything. I made the beat on Reason, and I recorded the song on Pro Tools. I did it with an MPC. Sh*t, that’s when I fell in love. He was walking me through [ProTools and Reason] but he made me do it myself. He was like, “I'm not finna do it for you. Drag that there.” I had rhythm and sh*t like that. I had a feel for what I was doing. I knew what I wanted to do. That's when I was into Kanye West like heavy. I was up on what was going on. I was probably in sixth grade when that sh*t happened. My garage was my studio until ""TwoFr."" I did ""TwoFr"" in my garage. I did half of it in Atlanta, and I did the other half right here in my garage. I remember doing a song with Slimmy B. All my homies was in the garage. That was my first time doing a feature with somebody that was bigger than me. Somebody I didn’t know. I had done sh*t with Jay and all of that, 1Take, and he was blowing up in the city. But that was my homie. We don’t look at it like that when that’s your homie. But that n**** Slimmy, I’m in the studio. Couple days later, that n**** was texting me. He sent me a song. I didn’t have nothing going. Playing the song back after I recorded it in the garage with all the homies, they’re like, “Man, that’s hard.” I was looking back like, “Man, that sh*t was tight,” like you’re doing shit now! All my homies were recording the garage, like me, Phabo. Phabo cut a gang of records. He’s new from Soulection. We be running through here making music. My first show was at a club in San Diego called F6. My dawg Junior used to run the club on Thursday nights. I was buying a hoverboard from bro in the parking lot at the crib. I was playing some music. The homie was playing my music out of the car because I had been recording little songs when I was in college, and I used to just be freestyling on sh*t. The homie’s playing my music. He was like, “What's that?"" I'm like, “Sh*t, that's me. I be rapping.” He’s like, “Yeah?” I'm like, “Yeah, I be getting little views and sh*t like that. I play football for real, but I be rapping on the side.” He’s like, “If you ever want to perform, come to the club. I could set it up on a Thursday night.” Thursday nights be cool. I told all my homies that I had a show, and I posted it. They made me a flyer. Everybody came out at my school. Everybody I f*cked with at my school came, all the sports— basketball, football, soccer, the girls that play tennis. The line was wrapped around the club because it was so many of us, the people that were supporting me. It was lit. We packed the whole club. I only had two songs. I performed two songs like five times, and it was just rocking. It was going up, and from there on out. I was like, “Alright, let me start doing music.” Then a couple months after that, I opened up for Young Thug , and that was my real first performance at a concert venue. It was at the Observatory in San Diego. I f*cking stage-dived, and they caught me. I was like, “I want to be a rapper.” I was brought in at that point, like, “Oh my god, you stage dived.” That sh*t crazy. So that was a n**** first show. Man, I watch ""Good Girls."" It’s one of my favorite shows. I be embarrassed to say it, but that's a real good show. I've met the security guard from the show. That's my homie now. I met him in the Gucci store. And I was like, “Hey, bro, you’re on Good Girls!"" He was like, “What?” Like, what the f*ck? You watch that show? I was like, “On god, that's my sh*t.” I started talking to bro about the show. We ended up being real cool. His name is Caleb [Tyler]. He ended up coming to my show at the Novo and everything right after that. I ended up making a buddy out of that. It was crazy, but I really f*ck with that show. I watch a lot of TV. TV is amazing. TV right now is really good. I see why people in the 90s were so into TV because it was actually following what was going on in their time period. Now I'm an adult, and I actually know what's going on in the world. It’s different from watching it as a kid because you don't really know. When you were a teenager, you didn't really know what was going on. You just watch the shows, but now, I can actually relate. And then on top of that, I'm making music now, and I'm actually becoming somebody, so I'm knowing people. I'm knowing the n***** in these shows, seeing n***** in the club. I’m going to the gym, seeing n***** in the gym. I’m playing in celebrity all-star games with people. My life crazy. If I had to sum it all up, this sh*t crazy. I could never have imagined living like this. Going on tour. We already finished the TwoFr tour. It was my first headlining tour ever, so I'm extremely excited. I’ve been working out, getting in a little tour mode. I just want to make sure I'm putting on a great show. I want to leave a good taste in everybody's mouth. That sounded crazy. I just want everybody to f*ck with the show. I want everybody to love it. I want to take my showmanship seriously. That's the difference between a lot of artists— people who just be standing up on stage and looking around. I want to make sure I get out of that bubble, graduate from that and actually put a show on. I hope people are excited. I don't think that people are expecting what I got planned. Finna take it through the roof. HNHH: What do you think of the current state of LA Hip-Hop? And do you think there's a time of the past that this era feels similar to? Kalan.FrFr: I don't feel like it's ever been like anything. There are so many of us that really f*ck with each other. I don't think I've ever seen it like this — that all people that aren't from the same label, or from the same clique, or from the same group. We all from different areas, different pockets in LA, but we all come together to make sh*t happen. Everybody knows about each other because of everybody. You know what I mean? It reminds me of Atlanta, how they got sh*t going on out there. We still working out the kinks and stuff, but from this generation, everybody's messing with everybody right now. It be a little politics here and there, but for the most part, people support each other. It's nothing better than that, and we lack a lot of that in LA, so I'm glad that it's getting better. I would say it's getting way better. Whenever I listened — at least when I listened to TwoFr 2 — I noticed you mention your grandma a lot. Talk to me a little bit about her influence on your music. She influences my life. I never want to let her down. I slept in a bed with my grandmother until the moment she passed away. She died in a bed with me. It’s a connection. I feel connected to her. I can just talk to her, and damn near feel like somebody’s saying something back to me. I got to do this sh*t. I got to be the best at it. I gotta make that sh*t work. Before my grandma died, she just told me, “You could do it.” She always told me I’m a star. She was always telling me, “whatever you want to do, just do it. You could do anything.” She would sit up and watch me act like Michael Jackson for an hour, then come in the backyard and watch me play football by myself, throwing the ball up in the air. Throwing me the ball so I could play football. Like, my grandma playing catch with me and shit like that. Different shit like that. Riding my bike. Watch me go and ride my bike, helping me make a ramp in the front yard. My mama was working, so I was with my grandma all the time. Anything I ever wanted to do, she made it okay for me to do it. A lot of things that people, in general, are lacking, starts as a child, and it starts with your parents, and it determines what you can be, how big you dream. A lot of people's parents and the world limit a lot of people's dreams, telling people what they can and cannot do and what they can and cannot be. I've never felt like I couldn't be nothing. Realistically, I knew I wasn't gonna be the president. I don't even like school. How the fuck am I gonna be president? I'm not interested in that. But if I was, I could. And if I couldn’t, then it wasn't for me. I never look at myself as a failure for trying something, because I tried, and I’mma always getting something out of it. You are always gonna get something out of something you trying. And if you not, and you continue to do it, you’re insane. That's literally the definition of insanity. My grandma, she just sit on me. She in my heart. People would think I'm crazy. I'll sit up and be talking like, “Granny, I got to do this sh*t.” They’re like, “Who are you talking to?” I can just feel her with me all the time. It's a spiritual thing. So Jay-Z calls and he gets you to sign with Roc Nation. What's the best advice he's been able to give you so far? We ain’t really had too many one-on-ones. During COVID, nobody was in the office, and then I'm from LA. Everybody's in New York. I'm just now starting to meet bro. Every time I see him, we be around a gang of people. There don’t be too much time, so I haven’t had my one-on-ones will bro yet. But when the time do come, I’ll let you know. That’s a mad surreal moment, going from listening to him in your headphones to meeting him. I didn't even know he was that tall, bro. That n**** tall. I had looked up like, “Damn.” He’s like a hooper. He got hooper size on him. That sh*t was shocking, seeing him in the office. I really admire bro, so this sh*t dope. Obviously, you’re such a fan of Kanye as well. Signing to Jay, did you ever acknowledge that parallel with Kanye’s career? Hell yeah. I posted a picture a couple months ago saying I was a Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer of the Roc. I been eating that sh*t up. That whole Kanye album with Jay talking at the end of it. Fuck you, Kanye, first and foremost. That's a dream. I would love to have Jay-Z talking at the end of my song. He don’t even got to do a feature, just say something. Who don't want that? I for sure have made the comparison, but I would never compare myself to Kanye. I’m my own guy. It’s just to have my own imagination of all of that sh*t when I was a child listening to it for the first time, and being a kid and wondering how it happened. Then thinking, “Damn, I was just with Jay-Z.” That's crazy. Like I said earlier, my life— it’s all new to me. In five years, this conversation—God willing—will be totally different. I'll be like, “Man, Jay was just over here tripping the other day at the house. We was eating crab legs. That's my n****.” But right now, this is all new to me, and I love it. Everything that comes with it, I love it.",https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/image/620x412c/cover/1635174227_a39ba6db486a9f04f4a01b6a349d8381.jpg/348b4c8b144c71313744502f5bb077f4/1635174227_79815c2ca5906e931c9976816097b7cf.jpg,realhotnewhiphop,"[('Kalan.', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY'), ('Hoochie Hotline', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY'), ('Kalan.', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY'), ('Jehkai.', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY'), ('Kalan.', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY'), ('808s & Heartbreaks', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY'), ('naked chicken.', 'MEDICAL ISSUE'), ('“Hoochie Hotline”', 'MEDICINE'), ('Blue', 'INSURANCE COMPANY NAME'), ('Durk', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY'), ('Denali.', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY'), ('Denali', 'MEDICINE'), ('homie’s', 'MEDICINE'), ('tennis.', 'MEDICAL ISSUE'), ('Finna', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY'), ('Kalan.', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY'), ('eating crab legs.', 'MEDICAL ISSUE')]",0.1,0.0,0.9

The LPGA Tour said Ko is projected to become world No. 1 with the win, overtaking American Nelly Korda. Ko was No. 1-ranked from July 20, 2019, to June 27, 2021, a streak of 100 consecutive weeks, and was also world No. 1 for 12 weeks in early 2019.

The Ted Lasso star returned to the show on October 23 alongside musical guest Brandi Carlile, having appeared as a cast member between 2003 and 2015. Sudeikis’s turn as host saw the show increase its ratings from last weekend, which was hosted by Rami Malek, as it drew in a 3.7 household live + same-day rating in 41 metered local markets, as well as 1.6 in the 18-49 demographic in 22 markets with local people meters (via Deadline). By contrast, Malek’s turn drew in 3.4 and 1.3, respectively, though Sudeikis’s episode was slightly down on the previous hosting turn by Kim Kardashian a few weeks ago, which took in 3.8, and an equal 1.6 in the latter markets. As part of his episode, Sudeikis joked about the success of his Apple TV+ series Ted Lasso, admitting in his opening monologue that it was “truly shocking to me because it’s built around two things Americans hate: soccer and kindness”. He also quipped about the advice current Saturday Night Live cast members had asked him for, saying: “Honestly, I found myself giving the same advice to every single person – win an Emmy. “And if you can, win two. Double up, that’s the best way to do it. It sets you up for success, I’ve found.” During his episode, Sudeikis revived his famous impression of Joe Biden from the Obama era alongside current cast member James Austin Johnson’s take on the US president, as well as that of Alex Moffat. Saturday Night Live will take a week off before returning with host Kieran Culkin, with Ed Sheeran scheduled to appear as musical guest.

Health Secretary Sajid Javid will tell NHS leaders to allow a third shot five months after a second dose instead of six as he aims to protect people from coronavirus this winter, The Mail on Sunday reported. Earlier this week, he urged eligible people to get a booster jab and the flu vaccine as he warned cases could hit 100,000 a day this winter. But at the moment, those eligible for a booster jab cannot book in advance and must wait an average of 18 days after the six months to get an appointment for a third vaccination. This is one of the reasons only approximately 4.5 million out of the 9.3 million people who qualify for the booster have received one, The Mail on Sunday added. The newspaper said Government sources had promised the new rules would be put in place as soon as possible, allowing eligible people to book a month in advance. Those eligible for boosters include anyone aged 50 and over, people living and working in care homes for the elderly, and frontline health and social care workers. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has urged eligible people to get a booster jab. (AFP) The Prime Minister’s advisors have also considered shortening the six-month window for a booster, but the current time is the optimum period to maximise immunity levels. Boris Johnson and senior health chiefs are also calling on the nation to get vaccinated against COVID-19 amid mounting concern over rising infection levels ahead of Christmas. The PM said vaccines would get the country through the winter and out of the pandemic, while NHS England’s national medical director Professor Stephen Powis said getting a booster will “protect the freedom and Christmas that we have all earned”. The repeated calls for people to get jabbed comes as Mr Johnson resists pleas from health leaders for tighter restrictions despite the rising number of cases. Downing Street insisted there was still spare capacity in the NHS and that Plan B would only be activated if it came under “significant pressure”. Plan B includes working-from-home guidance and the mandatory use of face masks. Boris Johnson has called on the nation to get vaccinated (Reuters) Mr Johnson, who has said there are no plans for another lockdown, said: “Vaccines are our way through this winter. Prof Powis, who said this week that the NHS feels “exceptionally busy”, has written in the Sunday Telegraph that it will “no doubt be a tough winter”. He said this time last year there were more than 6,800 people in hospital with Covid, and this weekend the figure is 6,405, but in 2020 the nation was still six weeks away from the world’s first vaccination. Mr Javid is also said to be ready to enforce laws to make Covid vaccines mandatory for people working for the NHS.  The calls for people to get their boosters come after Professor Peter Openshaw, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said case numbers and death rates are currently “unacceptable”.

(Picture: REX) Last year’s series of I’m a Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here was a bit different than usual. Due to the Covid pandemic, 2020’s show was filmed in cold conditions in a Welsh castle. Even though it had been based in the sunny, bug-packed Australian jungle since the show’s inception in 2002. ITV will be taking us back to Wales with a new line-up of celebrity campmates for 2021, due to ongoing Australia travel restrictions – and we absolutely can’t wait. But let’s recap on the most recent series first. Who won the last series of I’m a Celebrity? Let’s refresh your memory. Who won I’m a Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here 2020? A cast of 12 British stars travelled to freezing Gwrych Castle in Wales, with only one emerging as Queen of the Castle. It was… author and podcaster Giovanna Fletcher! Winner Giovanna with presenters Ant & Dec with the National Television Award (Picture: Dave J Hogan/Getty Images) Mum blogger Giovanna – who shares sons Buzz, Buddy and Max with McFly singer Tom Fletcher – won over the public’s affection for her warm and caring nature. She was often a shoulder to cry on, or a listening ear, for the other celebrities throughout the show. The finale episode saw Giovanna win the biggest share of a whopping 12 million votes – with some of those going to runner-up Jordan North, a BBC1 radio host. Vernon Kay, presenter of All Star Family Fortunes and other ITV game/reality shows, came in a respectable third place. Meanwhile, some of the longest-surviving campmates were EastEnders icon Shane Ritchie, Olympic champion Sir Mo Farah and ex-Strictly dancer AJ Pritchard. EastEnders actor Jessica Plummer, opera star Russell Watson and news broadcaster Victoria Derbyshire managed to outstay co-stars Beverley Callard of Coronation Street fame, theatre performer Ruthie Henshall and Paralympian Hollie Arnold – who went home first. Unfortunately, Giovanna didn’t receive the title ‘Queen of the Jungle’ – due to the obvious lack of an Australian jungle. But she was crowned the first-ever ‘Queen of the Castle’ (with a crown and sceptre) in the last moments of the 2020 series. When does the 2021 series of I’m a Celebrity start? It’s almost time for Giovanna to hand her crown over to the 2021 champion. There’s no exact start date for the UK series – though it is coming in November, which is when it traditionally starts. {""@context"":""https:\/\/schema.org"",""@type"":""VideoObject"",""name"":""Metro.co.uk"",""duration"":""T39S"",""thumbnailUrl"":""https:\/\/i.dailymail.co.uk\/1s\/2021\/10\/22\/13\/49509973-0-image-a-4_1634906121692.jpg"",""uploadDate"":""2021-10-22T13:35:01+0100"",""description"":""This year's series returns to stunning Gwrych Castle in North Wales."",""contentUrl"":""https:\/\/videos.metro.co.uk\/video\/met\/2021\/10\/22\/6358097753508562167\/640x360_MP4_6358097753508562167.mp4"",""height"":360,""width"":640} To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Usually, it starts mid-way through the month and lasts for around three weeks, with episodes airing every night.

KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 25 — Fitch Solutions has revised Malaysia’s 2021 growth forecast to 1.5 per cent from its earlier estimate 0 per cent.This comes as Malaysia’s daily Covid-19 cases have slipped from a peak of 24,599 on August 26 to just 6,210 on October 21 with a downtrend that appears to be entrenched coupled with the reopening of international travels to Langkawi most recently.In a brief commentary today, the research unit of the Fitch Group noted that its previous forecasts had assumed that Covid-19 restrictions would not be removed until daily cases fell below 4,000.“In view of these positive developments, we at Fitch Solutions have revised upward our 2021 real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth forecast from 0.0 per cent to 1.5 per cent. “Our forecast for 2022 remains at 5.5 per cent for now, with the economy likely to post a stronger recovery thanks to higher vaccination rates,” it said.With the improving situation, Fitch Solutions opined the government will now probably be able to honour its pledge to fully reopen the economy by this month’s end as the removal of domestic restrictions will provide a strong boost to the retail and services sector over the remainder of the year.It also cited Google’s mobility data which revealed a sharp improvement in foot traffic to retail outlets, parks and workplaces as restrictions have been gradually lifted by the government.“This means that Third Quarter 2021 is likely to have performed better in terms of private consumption than we previously expected and the revision reflects this. Having said that, Fitch Solutions later emphasised that the revision was a preliminary adjustment as it awaits a clearer indication as to the health of the economy with the release of Third Quarter 2021 real GDP growth results on November 12. “That said, we continue to caution that downside risks remain, particularly the possibility that the removal of restrictions will result in a surge in infections that forces the government to pause reopening plans. “In neighbouring Singapore, for example, the government was forced to reimplement tighter restrictions in late September. “If the Malaysian authorities are forced to abandon their reopening plan, this would delay the economic recovery into 2022,” it said.",2021-10-25 05:06:42,,,malaymail,"[('Shafwan Zaidon', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY'), ('KUALA LUMPUR', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY')]",0.4,0.7,0.0

China has all-but shut its borders to international travelers, with the number of international flights drastically reduced from pre-COVID levels, and games organizers said on Monday that domestic and foreign airlines will be encouraged to operate temporary flights available only to participants. Games participants will need to be tested for COVID-19 before arrival, and athletes and team officials must be vaccinated to avoid 21 days in quarantine, with some exceptions for medical reasons granted on a case-by-case basis. “We want everyone at the Games to be safe, that’s why we’re asking all participants to follow these guidelines,” IOC Olympic Games Executive Director Christophe Dubi said in a statement. “Keeping everyone healthy will ensure the focus remains on the very fundamentals of the Olympic and Paralympic Games – the athletes and the sport.” Organizers added that the closed loop system has been designed to keep competitors safe by reducing unnecessary interactions. Competitors will also be encouraged to wear masks and avoid spaces that are enclosed, crowded or involve close contact while every organization taking part in the Games will be asked to nominate COVID-19 Liaison Officers. Vaccination is not mandatory for the Beijing Games but some national Olympic committees, including that of the United States and Canada, are requiring team members to be vaccinated.

Fauci says vaccines for kids between 5 and 11 likely available in November,https://www.rappler.com/world/us-canada/anthony-fauci-covid-19-vaccines-kids-likely-available-november,,['Reuters'],,"Once authorized, roughly 28 million more children in the United States would be eligible to receive what would be the first US COVID-19 vaccine for younger kids","Vaccines for kids between the ages of 5 and 11 will likely be available in the first half of November, top US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said on Sunday, October 24, predicting a timetable that could see many kids getting fully vaccinated before the end of the year. “If all goes well, and we get the regulatory approval and the recommendation from the CDC, it’s entirely possible if not very likely that vaccines will be available for children from 5 to 11 within the first week or two of November,” Fauci said in an interview with ABC’s This Week. US Food and Drug Administration officials are reviewing the Pfizer/BioNTech application seeking authorization of its 2-dose vaccine for younger children, with its panel of outside advisers scheduled to weigh in on Oct. 26. The FDA typically follows the advice of its panel but is not required to do so. Advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will weigh in on recommendations for the vaccine at a meeting on November 2 and November 3, helping to inform a final decision by its director. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, speaking at Fox News Sunday, also said the agency wanted to act swiftly. “After they (FDA) are able to review all the science and conduct the regulatory action and the CDC will meet, and if all of that goes smoothly … we will act quickly,” she said. “We know how many parents are interested in getting their children between 5 and 11 vaccinated and we intend to act as quickly as we can,” she added. Once authorized, roughly 28 million more children in the United States would be eligible to receive what would be the first US COVID-19 vaccine for younger kids. The Pfizer/BioNTech shot is already available to those ages 12-17, and the companies are still studying it for children younger than 5. While children have a lower rate of death from COVID-19, many face illness and long-term symptoms that are still being studied. Many adults who have been hesitant or opposed to the COVID-19 vaccine, and even some who did not oppose the vaccine for themselves, are expected to resist giving the shot to their children. Asked if schools should mandate a vaccine for kids, Walensky said: “Right now we are at authorization. We’re having discussions about authorization. I think we need to get children vaccinated through this authorization and get to approval before we can make a judgment there.” – Rappler.com",2021-10-25 02:35:56,"Vaccines for kids between the ages of 5 and 11 will likely be available in the first half of November, top US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said on Sunday, October 24, predicting a timetable that could see many kids getting fully vaccinated before the end of the year.

Halo Infinite’s new campaign trailer has Master Chief chasing Cortana,https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744558/halo-infinite-campaign-overview-preview-trailer-master-chief-xbox-series-x,,['Chaim Gartenberg'],,,"Microsoft has finally revealed a new look at Halo Infinite’s campaign mode, marking the first time that developer 343 Industries has shown the campaign since its initial gameplay reveal in July 2020. The new six-minute trailer shows off a lot of Infinite’s new gameplay and systems in a short amount of time, including new weapons, new enemies, menacing bosses, and a new AI companion character that will be accompanying players called “The Weapon.” The overview also shows off some of Infinite’s new open world gameplay and RPG style gameplay additions, which include optional bases and objectives for players to pursue and selectable upgrades for equipment. Set after 2015’s Halo 5: Guardians, Infinite is the first mainline Halo game in over five years and will look to pick up the story of the artificial intelligence revolution led by Master Chief’s former ally Cortana that served as Halo 5’s cliffhanger. Infinite will also pick up story threads from 2017’s real-time strategy spinoff Halo Wars 2, which introduced the latest strain of Halo’s classic Covenant antagonists, the Brute-led “Banished.” Halo Infinite’s initial gameplay reveal was viewed by many as underwhelming, spawning disappointment in the purportedly next-gen visuals and the infamous “Craig” meme that dunked on a close-up shot of a particularly poorly rendered Brute. With Halo Infinite set to launch in just a few weeks on December 8th, the new campaign overview isn’t just a chance for 343 Industries to give players a better idea of what to expect from the game when it arrives, but also a chance for redemption and to better sell fans on Infinite’s potential after its lackluster first impression. While 343 Industries has largely been keeping Halo Infinite’s campaign under wraps (until today’s reveal, at least), the studio has been letting players try out Infinite’s free-to-play multiplayer mode in a series of preview weekends. These weekends have had a far more positive reception as an exciting evolution (and in many ways, a return to form) for the franchise. Halo Infinite was originally intended to launch alongside the Xbox Series X and Series S last fall, but the game was delayed to 2021 due to a variety of development challenges, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. It’s now set to arrive on PC, Xbox Series X / S, and Xbox One platforms on December 8th, although the game will ship without a few key features, including the campaign’s co-op mode and the popular Forge multiplayer map editor, both of which are slated for a 2022 release in a future update.",2021-10-25 13:16:33,,,theverge,[],0.4,0.0,1.0

Promoting the vaccines for Nicaraguans, Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez wrote in a post on Twitter that “the solidarity and brotherhood of Hondurans crosses borders.” He added that up to 500 doses were being given out daily to Nicaraguans. Honduran health authorities also pitched the cross-border assistance as a way to help beat back the risk of more infections at home. “They don’t have access to vaccines in Nicaragua and that becomes a risk for us due to the significant movement of people along the border,” said Honduran regional health official Jose Maria Paguada. Officials in Nicaragua did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The border vaccines doled out in Honduras’ southwestern Choluteca department utilize donated inoculations made by Moderna and Pfizer, and will go through Nov. 6 for first doses, with second doses to follow, Honduran officials said. To date, Honduras has confirmed more than 370,000 coronavirus infections and nearly 10,200 deaths as a result of the highly contagious respiratory disease caused by the virus.

Trudeau has long sought a trade deal with the 10-nation bloc, which includes the Philippines, Indonesia, Brunei, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Burma. He told a virtual business summit organized by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations that a free trade agreement with Canada would be a “win-win” for all sides, particularly coming out of the pandemic. Speaking in a pre-recorded message, Trudeau argued that an agreement with ASEAN would help companies and entrepreneurs build connections and business relationships around the world. He also said a pact would give investors more confidence to invest in international markets, and protect supply chains from the uncertainties brought by COVID-19. Trade bottlenecks across the globe have been slower to recover than consumer demand for goods, and slowed further by ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks and public health measures. All this affects inventories of in-demand consumer products or the delivery of parts needed to build things like cars, and pushes up transportation costs that get passed on to consumers, which is reflected in higher inflation rates. “As we finish the fight against COVID-19, deepening our ties with ASEAN economies and diversifying trade across the Asia-Pacific will play a crucial role in our recovery,” Trudeau said in his address. “My friends, a strong Canada-ASEAN relationship is a clear win-win for all of our businesses and all of our people.” The economies of the 10-nation bloc as a group represent Canada’s sixth largest trading partner, but the country already has access to four ASEAN members — Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam — through a Pacific Rim trade pact known as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). The Liberals’ election platform promised a new hub to help businesses take advantage of opportunities under CPTPP, and a new Asia-Pacific strategy aimed at deepening ties in the region, including new trade deals. A preliminary analysis by ASEAN and the federal government on the merits of a free trade deal estimated Canadian exports of goods and services to the bloc could go up by 13.3 per cent, valued at US$2.67 billion In his address, Trudeau said both sides must also ensure women, Indigenous people, LGBTQ entrepreneurs, visible minorities and other under-represented business owners get involved in and benefit from trade.

"While Headline Tours Struggle, Festivals Fuel the Concert Biz Comeback",https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/touring/9650608/concert-attendence-down-festivals/,"['Festivals', 'Touring', 'bbpro', 'BottleRock', 'Coronavirus']",['Dave Brooks'],,"This fall the Eagles, Billy Joel and others have seen no-show rates as high as 25% for some concerts -- but outdoor festivals are a brightspot for the touring business.","BottleRock has made playing until the plug gets pulled a rite of passage at their annual Napa, Calif., festival, where the event’s 10 pm curfew is enforced with a kill switch. The sudden loss of amplified sound can be jarring, but when the crowd chimes in to close out song, like they did during this year’s Guns N’ Roses set, bellowing together “Oh, won’t you please take me ho-ome,” the inevitable viral video is marketing gold for the following year’s ticket sales. This year, the high-energy close may have served as a confidence booster for the hard rock band, which recently made its post-pandemic return to the road to play 25 shows postponed from its 2020 tour, as well as 14 new ones in nearby markets. The act’s last big series of concerts was the Not in this Lifetime tour, which made $500 million starting in spring 2016 and became the fourth-highest-grossing in history, according to Billboard Boxscore. Since the concert business started again, however, it is having a hard time getting fans to show up. On average, 10% of fans who bought tickets to see Guns N’ Roses in 2019 and 2020 are coming to its shows, and performances planned for later this year in Mexico and Europe have been pushed back to 2022, amid worries about weak walkup sales. {""nid"":""9648655"",""type"":""post"",""title"":""Live Nation Stock Is Trading Over $100.

This fall, the Eagles, Billy Joel, George Strait, Zac Brown and James Taylor have seen no-show rates as high as 25% for some concerts. Industry executives blame persistent fears about the spread of COVID-19 in indoor venues, even among those who are vaccinated, as well as competition with a flood of other concerts, festivals and destination events. Even for shows that sold out already, that means fewer bodies in seats, as well as waker food, beverage and merchandise sales – plus a blow to the ability to bookers and promoters to plan ahead. Festivals like BottleRock, which sold out “in a matter of minutes” this year company officials say, are a bright spot in the post-pandemic music business, with the majority of such events increasing their attendance over 2019 levels, according to Live Nation’s most recent earnings report. One reason: Outdoor festivals are perceived to be safer than indoor shows. They also provide much better value. “Fans can see so many more acts at a festival for the same price they would pay to attend a big headline tour,” says Bobby Dee, who’s producing the Once Upon a Time in LA festival in December, which features Snoop Dogg, The Game and Al Green and sold out in less than 24 hours. “They are coming out the pandemic and making the decision that they don’t want to spend two hours watching one artist play their set and encore. They want the freedom to roam the event and curate their own experience.” {""nid"":""9649281"",""type"":""post"",""title"":""Neumos in Seattle, in a Pandemic: Ticket Sales Have 'Dropped Off a Cliff'"",""relative_path"":""\/articles\/business\/9649281\/neumos-seattle-pandemic-ticket-sales-no-show-rates\/"",""media"":{""width"":1548,""height"":1024,""extension"":""jpg"",""mime_type"":""image\/jpeg"",""type"":""image"",""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2020\/04\/Steven-Severin-in-a-pandemic-2020-billboard-1548-1587584028-compressed.jpg"",""sizes"":[{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2020\/04\/Steven-Severin-in-a-pandemic-2020-billboard-1548-1587584028-compressed.jpg"",""width"":1548,""height"":1024},{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2020\/04\/Steven-Severin-in-a-pandemic-2020-billboard-1548-1587584028-compressed.jpg"",""width"":1548,""height"":1024}],""orientation"":""landscape"",""id"":""9363693"",""caption"":null,""credit"":null}} With this in mind, artists are rethinking their touring plans for next year and beyond. In most cases, traditional headline concerts pay artists a guaranteed minimum, after which ticket revenue is split with the promoter, which means both sides share risk. Festivals instead offer acts a flat payment, regardless of subsequent ticket sales. That’s appealing to booking agents, who are worried about exposing their clients to risks as the concert business re-opens. It also gives some festivals the chance to book once-in-a-lifetime headliners like Stevie Nicks, who was booked to perform at BottleRock. It can also mean paying huge fees to book headline talent that might not bring in the kind of ticket sales organizers hoped for. In the case of BottleRock, weeks before the event, Nicks announced she couldn’t perform because of “rising COVID cases,” which left organizers to find a replacement big enough to placate customers and hopefully prevent refund requests that would put the festival in financial jeopardy. They secured Chris Stapleton, but he too pulled out the night before he was supposed to take the stage, blaming an unspecified illness. Brandi Carlile, who was already on the lineup, ended up filing in by flying in members of The Highwomen and singer Yola for a special set of their songs and covers. After all that, organizers say refund requests were minimal, speaking to the importance of the festival experience beyond headlining acts. But it shows how festivals may now need multiple backup plans. {""nid"":""9649430"",""type"":""post"",""title"":""How U.K. Touring Is Struggling to Keep On Truckin'"",""relative_path"":""\/articles\/business\/touring\/9649430\/uk-touring-struggling-post-brexit-rules\/"",""media"":{""width"":1548,""height"":1024,""extension"":""jpg"",""mime_type"":""image\/jpeg"",""type"":""image"",""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/10\/Market-global-bb15-2021-billboard-1548-1634755312-compressed.jpg"",""sizes"":[{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/10\/Market-global-bb15-2021-billboard-1548-1634755312-compressed.jpg"",""width"":1548,""height"":1024},{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/10\/Market-global-bb15-2021-billboard-1548-1634755312-compressed.jpg"",""width"":1548,""height"":1024}],""orientation"":""landscape"",""id"":""9648240"",""caption"":null,""credit"":null}} “If festivals continue to dominate in 2021, the major management companies might need to think about creating an on-call network of alternate acts that can step in at the last minute to high profile slots if something goes wrong,” said one agency source at the event. “We’ve got to prepare for a music business that’s going to require more flexibility and contingencies.”   {""account_id"":""1125911414"",""id"":""izFpZKac"",""title"":"""",""featured_media"":""""}",2021-10-25 20:12:30,,https://static.billboard.com/files/2021/10/guns-n-roses-bb15-touring-market-billboard-1548-1634754994-150x150.jpg,billboard,"[('waker food', 'MEDICAL ISSUE'), ('Stevie Nicks', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY')]",0.0,0.3,0.8

The prize will go to the team from anywhere on the planet who can invent a machine that extracts carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or oceans at gigatonne-scale. Previous X Prizes have been awarded for the application of artificial intelligence to global issues, turning carbon dioxide into useful products, developing cheaper methods of mass testing for COVID, and creating water from thin air. Horses for courses There is a sound argument that important pledges and projects should be the responsibility of governments rather than individuals. Billionaires often get where they are by acting on self-interest, so it isn’t reasonable to expect them to act in the interest of the entire public.

If an individual loses their money, it’s their loss. If the government loses the money, its the taxpayer’s loss. So governments have to be cautious. It’s probably not a matter of one or the other. Governments shouldn’t abandon their responsibility to act in the public interest. On the other hand, wealthy philanthropists throughout history have been prepared to help.

Is there a right time to move in with your partner?,https://metro.co.uk/2021/10/25/is-there-a-right-time-to-move-in-with-your-partner-15400844/,"['Sex', 'Dating', 'Relationships']",['Michele Theil'],,It might be better to consider if it's the 'wrong time'.,"Are you really ready to move in with your partner? (Picture: Getty Images) Moving in with a partner can be a big step in your relationship, and no matter how in love you are, you could be having doubts about whether it’s the right time. It might be a cliché, but for many people, moving in together is a test-run for the future – with any small squabbles kept in mind as an indicator of a relationship’s potential. As anyone moving in together will know, you also have to ensure your living habits are in sync – are you the type of person to leave your dishes for days on end, or do you clean them immediately? Do you like your home to be cool or cosy? Are you an early-riser or a night-owl? It can be very difficult to know for sure whether it’s the right time, but there are some things you should consider before making a decision. Callisto Adams, a dating and relationships expert, explains that while there is no ‘right time’ to move with a partner, there is definitely a wrong time: ‘If you have no clue of what you’re getting yourself into, then it is too soon.’ ‘If you don’t know what they’re like when they’re sad, mad, angry, happy, joyful, whether they’re a messy person or a super tidy one, if they’re an early bird or a night owl, and most importantly if you’re not emotionally connected to them, it is definitely too soon,’ she tells Metro.co.uk. To know you’re ready to move in with someone, Adams says you should ‘feel excitement’ when you think of ‘sharing a space with your partner’. ‘If it feels forced, and the fear is just too much to bear, then you’re not ready,’ she adds. Emma (24) is just about to move in with partner after a year together and she can’t wait to move in with him. She says: ‘It’s definitely the right decision for us because we’ve lived over an hour away from each other for the past year, and making time to see each other while dealing with work, friends, and other commitments can be hard. ‘This way, we know we’ll see each other every night and have quality time with each other.’ Alice and her partner are very excited to move in together, and after a year together, they don’t feel rushed to it at all. In fact, Alice says they wanted to move in together after just four months but due to leases, finding a suitable home, and the impact of Covid, they were forced to wait. Natasha (22) will be moving with her partner in just a few weeks too, but they have been together for just under six months. Though some people may think that’s soon, Natasha feels that both practically and emotionally, it is the right move for them. ‘My lease is up and if we weren’t moving in together, I would probably have to move further away from where I am now, which would severely impact our relationship. Due to our work schedules, it’s hard enough finding time together, so moving in together is the best thing for us both,’ Natasha explained. We put the question out on Twitter to ask for stories about their timelines for moving in with partners. One person said, ‘I moved in with my boyfriend after five months of going out. It didn’t feel too soon because we felt comfortable with each other already but I guess it depends on the couple.’ Another said, ‘We moved in together at around six months and got engaged three months later. We’re still married nearly ten years later.’ A third wrote, ‘We moved in together after a year and now we’re just about to celebrate our 8th wedding anniversary.’ A fourth said, ‘We moved in together after about five weeks and we’re still together almost three years later – it was just right for us!’ Couples move in together at their own pace (Picture: Getty) Others took longer, with one person writing that they moved in with their husband after 10 years together but that was because they didn’t want to ‘waste money on rent’. A few others moved in together after around one and a half years together and felt that it was the ‘right time’ for them. One person moved in with their ex after a year together and then broke up after a year living together, saying that it was ‘too soon’ for them. Everyone has different experiences, meaning the timing has to feel ‘right’ for you and your partner above all else. Adams emphasises that couples should be discussing their living habits in great detail, and whether you’re ‘willing to handle hair on the sink or clothes on the ground, or whatever ‘not the best’ habit they have communicated to you.’ More: DatingWhat each star sign is like as an ex and how they deal with breakupsWhat is the Strictly Come Dancing curse and are there any romances on the 2021 show?How do couples choose the right 'third' for a threesome?

Blak...,"NEW YORK (AP) — Andrew Mangiapane scored twice and the Calgary Flames beat the New York Rangers 5-1 on Monday night for their third straight win. Blake Coleman and Mikael Backlund each had a goal and an assist, and Christopher Tanev also scored for Calgary. Johnny Gaudreau got his seventh assist of the season and Jacob Markstrom stopped 28 shots. Dryden Hunt scored for the Rangers, who had won four straight — all on the road. Igor Shesterkin, making his fifth start, finished with 32 saves. Trailing 2-0 after 40 minutes, the Rangers got on the scoreboard early in the third period. Markstrom stopped the initial shot by Jacob Trouba, but Hunt corralled a rebound in front and put it past the goalie for his first of the season at 5:25. Coleman restored Calgary’s two-goal lead less than three minutes later as he backhanded the rebound of his own shot past Shesterkin for his second. Backlund made it 4-1 with 8 1/2 minutes left as he scored into the top left corner from the right circle for his first. Mangiapane got his second of the night, scoring on a rebound on the power play from the right side with just over five seconds remaining. It was his fifth of the season and 10th in his last nine games, dating to last season. Leading 1-0 after one period, the Flames doubled their lead early in the second. Mangiapane intercepted a pass by Patrik Nemeth from behind the Rangers net and beat Shesterkin from the right side at 2:09. Mika Zibanejad had a chance to get the Rangers on the scoreboard after a Flames turnover as he skated up the ice with Alexis Lafreniere, but was denied by Markstorm with about 6 1/2 minutes left in the middle period. Shesterkin made a nice glove stop on a slap shot by Tyler Pitlick about 40 seconds later. Markstrom stopped a wraparound try by Trouba with just more than two minutes to go, and then denied his backhand follow. Calgary outshot New York 15-7 in the first period. Shesterkin’s best save of the period came on an attempt by Sean Monahan in front with 3:15 remaining after a giveaway by the goalie. Tanev got the Flames on the scoreboard on a rush with 1:10 left in the opening period as he got a pass from Gaudreau and beat Shesterkin from the right circle on the glove side for his first of the season. Elias Lindholm got his first assist and seventh point on the play. The Rangers were down two players for much of the first. Rugged forward Ryan Reaves went to the dressing room early in the period after an apparent injury to his left leg, and defenseman Ryan Lindgren joined him by the midpoint after blocking a shot with his foot. Lindgren was back on the bench late in the period, and returned to the ice in the second. Reaves was also on the bench at the start of the second, but did not play again. SPECIAL TEAMS The Rangers went 0 for 2 on the power play and are 3 for 26 this season. … The Flames were 1 for 2 with the man advantage, improving to 3 for 14. LINEUPS Ryan Strome returned to the Rangers’ lineup after missing the four-game road trip due to COVID-19 protocols. He started on a line with Artemi Panarin and Barclay Goodrow. Morgan Barron was sent to Hartford of the AHL to make room for Strome. Injured forward Kappo Kakko is still out and coach Gerard Gallant said Kakko could return Friday. Julian Gauthier was also back in the lineup, and Greg McKegg was scratched. With the exception of Markstrom, the Flames used the same lineup as Saturday against Washington.

Six popular beliefs about colds: Experts explain the facts,https://metro.co.uk/2021/10/25/six-popular-beliefs-about-colds-experts-explain-the-facts-15464894/,"['Tech', 'Health', 'Metro newspaper']",['The Conversation'],,"No, garlic won't cure your cold.","No, garlic won’t cure your cold (Picture: Getty Images/iStockphoto) As we return to pre-lockdown levels of social mixing, colds are starting to become all too common. A TikTok video has gone viral involving putting garlic up your nose as a cold cure, just one in a long line of claimed treatments or cures. We asked two experts to examine some commonly held beliefs around colds. 1. Can you get a cold by getting cold? Colds become more common in winter. Like other upper respiratory tract infections (in the nose, throat and windpipe) they are normally caused by a virus. There might be a little truth in the idea that getting cold can give you a cold, because as the temperature changes this can alter the lining of our throat and windpipe, which can possibly make it easier for viruses to infect cells. However, the main reason we get more colds in winter is spending more time inside, closer to other people – the perfect environment to transmit viruses. 2. Does sticking garlic up your nose help? The TikTok trend involves putting cloves of garlic up your nose because it claims to act as a decongestant. Sticking something up your nose blocks the flow of mucus, so when it is removed, the flow starts and the mucus drips or even runs out of your nose. Mucus not only helps trap and remove pathogens including viruses, but also contains antibodies and can reduce how infectious and spreadable viruses are. So this is not a good idea. Garlic contains a range of compounds which might irritate the nose, and remember sticking anything up your nose isn’t a great idea. It could damage the lining and lead to bleeding or even get stuck. So it doesn’t really help and could be harmful. A TikTok trend suggested putting peeled cloves of garlic up your nose (Picture: Getty Images/Tetra images RF) 3. Can herbal remedies prevent colds? Various herbal remedies claim to either prevent or speed up recovery from a cold. People often mention echinacea, a family of plants that grow in North America. Some trials have suggested a small preventative effect, but the evidence does not show statistically significant reductions in illness levels. Turmeric is also touted as a preventative medicine, but there is no robust evidence for its effectiveness either. 4. Can vitamin C help? Nobel prize-winning scientist Linus Pauling suggested that vitamin C in high doses could be an effective treatment for many viral infections. But a Cochrane review, a very robust system in which researchers assess evidence, found that vitamin C did not prevent colds, but may reduce their duration, in some people. As vitamin C supplements of around 200mg per day are considered low risk, some suggest this is a reasonable strategy to shorten the effects of a cold. Vitamin C supplements might help shorten the duration of a cold (Picture: Getty Images) 5. Does vitamin D prevent colds? Vitamin D has moved from being the sunshine vitamin associated with healthy bones, to being linked to reducing the risks around everything from heart disease and diabetes to viruses. This has included a lot of interest in vitamin D as a way of helping us fight off flu and more recently Covid-19. Laboratory experiments show that vitamin D is important in supporting immunity and this is critical in fighting off viruses. The problem may be that some people have inadequate vitamin D levels. Sunshine allows us to make our own vitamin D — but that happens less in winter. So it is likely that taking vitamin D supplements as advised by the UK government over winter is sensible so that you get enough, and this may help prevent you from getting a cold. 6. What about chicken soup? Chicken soup has been used through the ages to treat colds, and like honey it might have some benefits in managing symptoms. But it is unlikely to make a big impact on driving out the infection. The water in the soup will help with hydration, which is a often a problem when we have a cold. Like most hot drinks it can help to relieve painful sinuses. There are studies looking at the effect on our immune system cells, but the evidence from these is far from conclusive. Sadly, there are no miracle cures for the common cold. Some suggestions may be helpful, and are generally not harmful, such as getting enough vitamin C and D. But others are definitely not worth trying and could be risky, such as putting garlic up your nose. The best thing to do is get plenty of rest and drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated.

This has included a lot of interest in vitamin D as a way of helping us fight off flu and more recently Covid-19. Laboratory experiments show that vitamin D is important in supporting immunity and this is critical in fighting off viruses. The problem may be that some people have inadequate vitamin D levels. Sunshine allows us to make our own vitamin D — but that happens less in winter. So it is likely that taking vitamin D supplements as advised by the UK government over winter is sensible so that you get enough, and this may help prevent you from getting a cold. Chicken soup has been used through the ages to treat colds, and like honey it might have some benefits in managing symptoms. But it is unlikely to make a big impact on driving out the infection. The water in the soup will help with hydration, which is a often a problem when we have a cold. Like most hot drinks it can help to relieve painful sinuses. There are studies looking at the effect on our immune system cells, but the evidence from these is far from conclusive. Sadly, there are no miracle cures for the common cold. Some suggestions may be helpful, and are generally not harmful, such as getting enough vitamin C and D. But others are definitely not worth trying and could be risky, such as putting garlic up your nose. The best thing to do is get plenty of rest and drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated.

Twenty-eight cases were active as of early Monday evening. There are currently no COVID-19 hospitalizations. There have been eight deaths in Algoma District, the most recent reported last Tuesday. Eleven new COVID-19 cases were reported Saturday and four more Sunday, all from Sault Ste. Marie and area. Fourteen became ill from close contact. It’s not known how one person became ill, APH said. All are self-isolating. Ten people were tested Friday. One person was tested Saturday. Meanwhile, additional individuals associated with River View Public School have tested positive for COVID-19. Algoma District School Board says there’s six confirmed cases. ADSB said late last Thursday that Algoma Public Health had declared an outbreak at the Wireless Avenue school. The health unit is identifying close contacts, a release says. Any low-and high-risk contacts will be contacted by letter by the health unit. Also, APH reported Saturday an individual associated with the YMCA before and after school program, McNabb site, tested positive for COVID-19. APH says if families from the program do not receive a low risk and/or high risk contact letter, their child is not considered a close contact of the person who tested positive, in which case APH does not recommend having their child tested unless he or she is showing symptoms. Algoma Public Health says it is is working with that specific Y program and child-are centre to review and confirm “important practices” to reduce the potential spread of COVID-19.

Eight things we learned from the Facebook Papers,https://www.theverge.com/22740969/facebook-files-papers-frances-haugen-whistleblower-civic-integrity,,['Russell Brandom'],,,"A massive new document release shows chaos and confusion inside the world’s most powerful social network For months, Facebook has been shaken by a steady leak of documents from whistleblower Frances Haugen, beginning in The Wall Street Journal but spreading to government officials and nearly any outlet with an interest in the company. Now, those documents are going much more public, giving us the most sweeping look at the operations of Facebook anyone not directly involved with the company has ever had. The documents stem from disclosures made to the SEC and provided to Congress by Haugen in redacted form. The Verge and a consortium of other news organizations have obtained redacted versions of the documents, which we’re calling The Facebook Papers. In order to receive the documents, we agreed to begin publishing our reporting on them this week, but we are not beholden to report on them in a certain way or coordinate what we cover with other outlets. We’ve already done some reporting on the files, and we’ll keep reporting on them over the coming weeks. (There are a lot of pages.) This isn’t a comprehensive list of everything in the documents, and you should fully expect more to come out. Instead, think of it as a summary of the files that, so far, have stood out to us the most. Hopefully, it will help you make sense of the sheer volume of Facebook news coming out this morning. Facebook was caught off guard by vaccine misinformation in comments Facebook has taken a lot of criticism for its handling of COVID misinformation — including from President Biden, who accused the platform of “killing people” by letting anti-vaxx sentiment run amok — but the leaks show just how chaotic the effort was inside the company. One document dated March 2021 shows an employee raising the alarm about how unprepared the platform was. “Vaccine hesitancy in comments is rampant,” the memo reads. “Our ability to detect vaccine-hesitant comments is bad in English, and basically non-existent elsewhere. We need Policy guidelines specifically aimed at vaccine hesitancy in comments.” (Editor’s note: We are not publishing the document itself since it contains the full name of a Facebook employee.) “Comments are a significant portion of misinfo on FB,” says another employee in an internal comment, “and are almost a complete blind spot for us in terms of enforcement and transparency right now.” “For English posts on Vaccines, vaccine hesitancy prevalence among comments is 50 percent.” The document makes clear that Facebook already had a “COVID-19 lockdown defense” project dedicated to the platform dynamics created by the pandemic, including a workstream dedicated entirely to vaccine hesitancy. That team had also created significant automated flagging systems for misinformation — but according to the files, those simply weren’t being used to downrank anti-vaccine comments. As of the March memo, there were no plans to develop moderation infrastructure like labeling, guidelines, and classifier systems to identify anti-vaccine statements in comments. The failure to meaningfully moderate comments was noticed outside the company. A First Draft News study in May looked at the comments for a handful of major news outlets with more than a million followers and found one in five comments on vaccine-related stories contained some kind of anti-vaccine misinformation. The documents show Facebook was aware of the problem, and First Draft may have even underestimated the issue. One comment on the post reads, “for English posts on Vaccines, vaccine hesitancy prevalence among comments is 50 percent.” Other aspects of the issue remained completely unstudied since the company had yet to dig in on the comment problem. “We currently don’t understand whether Group comments are a serious problem,” the post argues. “It’s clear to us that the ‘good post, bad comment’ problem is a big deal, but it’s not necessarily as clear that [vaccine hesitant] comments on [vaccine hesitant] posts are additive to the harm.” Another document published shortly after April 2021 shows the company still coming to terms with vaccine misinformation. The good news was that there was no evidence of a foreign influence campaign driving anti-vaxx sentiment, as had stung the company in 2016. But the vast majority of content was being sent by a relatively small portion of accounts, suggesting that Facebook had not yet taken the easiest measures to address the issue. Facebook has taken some steps recently to address misinformation in comments — including new downranking rules from just last week. But these documents show those changes came more than six months after the alarm had been raised internally and after Facebook had publicly expressed anxiety about the impending leak. Given the huge surge of COVID deaths among vaccine-skeptical populations over the past three months, it’s easy to see the recent changes as too little, too late. Apple threatened to ban Facebook over online “slave markets” Facebook scrambled to address human trafficking content after Apple threatened to kick its apps off the iOS App Store, a leaked SEV (or Site Event) report shows. The report, referenced briefly by The Wall Street Journal’s Facebook Files reporting, indicates that Apple threatened to pull Facebook and Instagram from iOS on October 23rd of 2019. Apple had been tipped off by a BBC News Arabic report that found domestic workers being sold via Instagram and other apps, where sellers encouraged buyers to mistreat the workers by doing things such as confiscating their passports. the policy was “highly likely leading to exploitation of domestic servants” Facebook had been aware of the problem but hadn’t understood the scope of it, apparently because very little content (less than 2 percent of the material it found) had been reported by users. “Removing our applications from Apple platforms would have had potentially severe consequences to the business,” the Facebook report notes. After Apple escalated the issue, Facebook moderators swept the platforms for keywords and hashtags mentioned in the BBC reporting, ultimately disabling 1,021 accounts and removing 129,121 pieces of content. Facebook also removed a policy exception letting established brick and mortar businesses like recruitment agencies post ads about domestic workers. Facebook determined that even if the businesses were legal, the policy was “highly likely leading to exploitation of domestic servants.” Apple was apparently satisfied with the mitigation measures, and the incident was closed within a week. The Civic Integrity team was often directly blocked by Zuckerberg One of the most alarming incidents uncovered by the papers was that Mark Zuckerberg personally intervened to ensure Facebook would comply with a repressive law instituted in Vietnam, agreeing to moderate more aggressively against “anti-state” content on the platform. The anecdote leads The Washington Post’s report on the papers and plays into a much more troubling dynamic described by Haugen before Congress. Facebook’s Integrity team had lots of ideas for how to make Facebook less harmful, but they were usually overruled, sometimes by Zuckerberg himself. Bloomberg News explores the issue in more detail, showing how the company often found its own efforts to downrank harmful content overwhelmed by the content’s inherent virality. As one employee put it, “I worry that Feed is becoming an arms race.” Politico highlights another employee quote showing just how demoralized the team had become. “If we really want to change the state of our information ecosystem, we need a revolution, not an evolution of our systems,” an employee wrote in October 2019. “If you don’t have enough good content to boost, it doesn’t matter how much you downrank the bad.” Facebook used a German anti-vaccine movement as a test case for more aggressive moderation Another document details Facebook’s so-called “Querdenken experiment,” in which the company’s moderators tested out a more aggressive moderation approach on a German conspiracy movement. Facebook’s Dangerous Content team was already developing a new classification — a “harmful topic community” — and the growing Querdenken was chosen as an experiment on how the classification would work in practice. As a Facebook employee writes in the document, “this could be a good case study to inform how we tackle these problems in the future” “this could be a good case study to inform how we tackle these problems in the future” Querdenken has become one of the leading anti-lockdown and anti-vaccination groups in Germany, with similarities to more extreme groups like QAnon. As the Facebook proposal framed it, the Querdenken movement had potential for violence but wasn’t yet linked to extreme enough activity that would justify banning followers from the platform entirely. The documents give few details about how the experiment proceeded, although clearly, some version of the Querdenken plan was implemented. (A later report says “results from some initial samples look promising.”) And judging by the company’s public statements, it did result in a meaningful change to moderation policy: in September, Facebook announced a new policy on “coordinated social harm,” specifically citing Querdenken as an example of the new approach in action. Unlike many of the other documents, the Querdenken experiment shows Facebook’s moderation system as relatively effective. The company identified the group before it caused significant harm, took action with an eye towards long-term consequences and was transparent about the policy shift after it took place. But the incident shows how complex the interplay of policy and enforcement can be, with broader policies often rewritten with an eye towards specific groups. And for supporters of Querdenken, it may be alarming to learn that the rules of the world’s largest social platform were rewritten specifically to keep their movement from gaining public support. Facebook’s January 6th response was shaped by glitches and delays Facebook discussed developing extreme “break-glass measures” to limit misinformation, calls to violence, and other material that could disrupt the 2020 presidential election. But when former President Donald Trump and his supporters tried to stop successor Joe Biden from being declared president on January 6th, 2021, Facebook employees complained these measures were implemented too late or stymied by technical and bureaucratic hangups. Reports at Politico and The New York Times outline Facebook’s struggle to handle users delegitimizing the elections. Internally, critics said Facebook didn’t have a sufficient game plan for “harmful non-violating narratives” that toed the line between misinformation and content Facebook wants to preserve as free speech. And some plans, like a change that would have prevented Groups from changing their names to terms like “Stop the Steal,” apparently got held up by technical problems. Facebook was trying to rebalance its News Feed for “civic health” The Wall Street Journal first revealed that news outlets and political parties had complained about users favoring negative and hyperbolic content. Facebook was considering ways to fix the problem, and one method involved re-weighting the News Feed to optimize for “civic health” instead of primarily focusing on meaningful social interactions or session time. In a product briefing called “Ranking For Civic Health,” Facebook acknowledged that “people think that political content on Facebook is low quality, untrustworthy, and divisive,” and the current ranking system was “not creating a wholly valuable civic experience for users.” (Based on document comment dates, the document was produced around January and February of 2020.) “people think that political content on Facebook is low quality, untrustworthy, and divisive” The document says Facebook’s ranking algorithm recommended civic content that users themselves didn’t report finding valuable — something earlier leaks have indicated was a problem with meaningful social interactions (MSI) and other engagement-based metrics. “Our current ranking objectives do not optimize for integrity outcomes, which can have dangerous consequences,” it says — for instance, MSI optimization was “contributing hugely to Civic misinfo,” and Facebook estimated that removing it from Civic posts would decrease it by 30 to 50 percent. Facebook tried to improve civic health by asking users explicitly what they thought constituted good civic content. This sometimes revealed even bigger problems — since Facebook apparently found that 20 to 30 percent of respondents “may say that known Civic hate is ‘good for the community’” in surveys. Facebook settled on a strategy to “prioritize the reduction of policy-violating content — such as Civic Hate or Civic Misinfo — even if the individual user finds it valuable” and aimed to reduce the prevalence of civic hate speech, misinformation, and inflammatory content by at least 10 percent. The company ran rebalancing experiments in February 2020 by slightly increasing the amount of “civic” News Feed content that a random set of users saw, then optimizing that content through different metrics (including MSI and whether people thought content was “worth your time”). It also ran a survey to collect how users felt about civic News Feed content. The company aimed to have a new optimization system chosen by March of 2020 — although it’s not clear how the coronavirus pandemic may have changed those plans. Why likes were never hidden on Facebook and Instagram A highly publicized plan from early last year to hide like counts on Instagram never happened because testing the change hurt ad revenue and led to people using the app less. A quiet test of the experience on the Facebook app was also killed after leadership told Zuckerberg that it wasn’t a “top barrier to sharing nor a top concern for people.” A lengthy internal presentation to Zuckerberg about the plan, dubbed Project Daisy, shows that there were concerns among leadership about how the Facebook app would have been perceived if Instagram hid like counts and Facebook did not, which is something employees who were involved in the project have told The Verge. Employees working on Instagram wanted to bill it as a way to depressurize the app for young people, but the team working on the Facebook app wasn’t into the idea. If Instagram went through with hiding likes, the presentation details how leadership at Facebook wanted to “minimize blowback to the Facebook app” for not hiding them and still “ensure credit ladders up to the Facebook company.” Instead of hiding likes for all users by default as was originally planned, Instagram earlier adopted a half measure by letting people opt into hiding their likes. Facebook’s “civic groups” policy stumbled over a simple design flaw In October 2020, Facebook announced that it would stop recommending civic and political groups to users in the US as part of a broader effort to avoid the mistakes of the 2016 election. (The policy was made permanent shortly after the January 6th riot.) But actually keeping those groups out of Facebook recommendation feeds has been a huge challenge for the company — and an internal document gives us new insight into why. The document shows Facebook employees grappling with a public article, flagged by the PR team, which found 30 separate groups still appearing in recommendation feeds in apparent violation of the policy. Escalated on January 19th, the document says many of the groups named in the report had been labeled as civic groups at one point — but were somehow still being recommended as part of facebook’s Groups You Should Join feature. Reducing churn could have solved almost all of the problems “Leakage has been there since Nov 2020 at the least,” the Facebook document reads. It’s not clear which article the document is referring to, but there were a number of reports spotting enforcement failures at the time. The Markup found a bunch of groups slipping through that January and again in June. Even now, it’s not clear the civic groups policy is being enforced as intended. At the time, most observers focused on the conceptual difficulty: it’s a hard philosophical problem to draw a clear line between which groups count as “civic” and even harder to scale it across a platform of Facebook’s size. But the internal report shows the real problem was much simpler. Facebook’s monitoring system (referred to in the report as “Laser”) had been trained to only look at the past seven days of content when determining whether a page fell into the “civic groups” category, which meant pages were constantly filtering in and out as the period viewed by the algorithm changed. In practice, that meant a pro-Trump or pro-Biden group could easily dodge the label by posting a few days worth of less obviously political content. The report estimates that a full 12 percent of labeled groups would churn out of the category from day to day. According to the report, 90 percent of the groups highlighted by the article had been caught by Facebook’s existing “civic groups” classifier — but they’d filtered out as part of the churn. So reducing churn alone could have solved almost all of the problems spotted by the report. There have been lots of stories like this over the past five years: Facebook sets a policy that seems measured and responsible, but a cursory test (usually from a journalist) shows banned content is still easily slipping through. From the outside, it’s often unclear how much of the problem is incompetence at Facebook and how much is just the inherent difficulty of managing a platform of that size. But in this case, the documents put the blame squarely on Facebook as a company. This was a high-profile policy with huge stakes for the country at large, with obvious delicacy in how it was implemented. A churn rate that high made it inevitable that targeted groups would slip through the cracks, and the company simply didn’t notice until reporters called them out.",2021-10-25 15:40:19,,,theverge,"[('Haugen', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY'), ('anxiety', 'MEDICAL ISSUE'), ('Querdenken', 'MEDICINE'), ('QAnon.', 'MEDICAL ISSUE'), ('Querdenken', 'MEDICINE'), ('inflammatory', 'MEDICAL ISSUE'), ('difficulty', 'MEDICAL ISSUE')]",0.0,0.2,0.8
Quentin Tarantino’s Music Recommendation to Edgar Wright Inspired the ‘Last Night in Soho’ Movie Title,https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/quentin-tarantino-music-recommendation-edgar-wright-inspired-last-night-in-soho-movie-title.html/,"['movies', 'music', 'Quentin Tarantino']",['Jeff Nelson'],,'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' filmmaker Quentin Tarantino recommended a song to Edgar Wright. That one song ended up being the perfect title for 'Last Night in Soho.',"Edgar Wright is the beloved filmmaker behind big titles such as Shaun of the Dead and Baby Driver. His long-anticipated Last Night in Soho suffered from coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic-related delays. Wright’s fans are incredibly excited to finally experience his newest movie. Wright recently recalled in an interview that he came up with the Last Night in Soho thanks to a music recommendation from legendary filmmaker Quentin Tarantino. Quentin Tarantino has stories behind his soundtracks Quentin Tarantino | Elisabetta Villa/Getty Images for RFF Tarantino is known for having very distinctive music in his movies. He handpicks each and every song used in his movies. Many of them come from his own massive music collection. These songs build the setting and atmosphere for the given movie. He emphasizes the importance of selecting the right songs for his movies. For example, Dick Dale’s “Misirlou” in Pulp Fiction‘s opening credits starts the movie off with a bang. Meanwhile, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood features a collection of music from 1960s radio to perfectly establish the time period. Tarantino has a vast knowledge of film, but he’s also rather well-versed when it comes to music knowledge. One music recommendation gave Edgar Wright the ‘Last Night in Soho’ movie title Wright spoke about the process of coming up with a title for Last Night in Soho with Total Film. He expressed that he has always had a fascination with 1960s London, even though he never experienced it himself. Wright was trying to come up with a movie title for Last Night in Soho but was having some difficulty. His first ideas included Red Light Area and The Night Has a Thousand Eyes. However, they were a bit too close to other movie titles. The filmmaker said that the Last Night in Soho title came from a particular conversation with Tarantino. The initial conversation was regarding Tarantino’s movie Death Proof. They were talking about Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick, and Tich’s 1968 song “Hold Tight!” Tarantino personally recommended Wright to listen to their song “Last Night in Soho.” Wright said he then realized his movie title was “staring [him] in the face.” Tarantino called the song “the best title music for a film that’s never been made.” Wright ended up taking that challenge. Quentin Tarantino responds to the Edgar Wright using the ‘Last Night in Soho’ title Wright didn’t get the chance to talk to Tarantino about naming his movie Last Night in Soho. He was working on Once Upon a Time in Hollywood at the time, which kept him ridiculously busy. Wright later asked Tarantino if it was acceptable that he took the idea from him. Tarantino told him that the idea originated from filmmaker Allison Anders, but that “only [Wright] could make that movie.” So, there’s no bad blood here. Last Night in Soho is currently enjoying generally positive reviews from critics. The movie opens in theaters Oct. 29 for audiences to finally check out Wright’s latest movie.

Packers’ Davante Adams could miss Cardinals showdown on COVID list,https://nypost.com/2021/10/25/packers-davante-adams-goes-on-covid-19-reserve/,,['Associated Press'],,The Packers likely will have to face the unbeaten Cardinals without 2020 All-Pro receiver Davante Adams and defensive coordinator Joe Barry.,The Packers likely will have to face the unbeaten Cardinals without 2020 All-Pro receiver Davante Adams and defensive coordinator Joe Barry.,2021-10-25 21:42:14,"GREEN BAY, Wis. — The Green Bay Packers likely will have to face the unbeaten Arizona Cardinals without 2020 All-Pro receiver Davante Adams and defensive coordinator Joe Barry. General manager Brian Gutekunst announced Monday afternoon that the team has placed Adams on the reserve/COVID-19 list. That announcement came just over an hour after coach Matt LaFleur confirmed that Barry had tested positive. LaFleur said that Barry is fully vaccinated and therefore possibly could join the Packers (6-1) for Thursday night’s game if he tested negative Tuesday and Wednesday. “But I’m not going to hold my breath on that,” LaFleur said. LaFleur spoke to reporters before the announcement regarding Adams, who is tied for second in the NFL in catches (73) and is third in yards receiving (744). He did say there were “potentially some other issues with staff.” The reserve/COVID-19 list is for players who either test positive or have close contact with someone who’s infected. LaFleur said the Packers are in advanced protocols and conducted all of Monday’s coaches meetings virtually. LaFleur said all team personnel have to wear masks while in the building, whether or not they’re vaccinated. The Packers are working through which assistant will be responsible for calling defensive plays Thursday if Barry’s unavailable. One candidate could be defensive backs coach Jerry Gray, who has been a defensive coordinator with the Buffalo Bills (2001-05) and Tennessee Titans (2011-13). “I think regardless of how we do it, it’ll be a collective effort with everybody involved and having an input,” LaFleur said. “But certainly you feel confident with a guy like Jerry, who’s called it before and has had a top-five defense in this league. So we definitely have people that we feel are capable of getting the job done.”",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/davante-adams-packers-covid-status.jpg?quality=90&strip=all,nypost,[],0.0,0.5,0.5

The agency had initially hoped to launch the test flight by the end of this year, with astronauts set to walk on the Moon by 2024. Artist impression of Nasa’s Orion spacecraft It achieved a major milestone last Wednesday when it stacked the Orion crew capsule atop its Space Launch System megarocket. The huge spacecraft now stands 322 feet (98 meters) tall inside the Vehicle Assembly Building at NASA Kennedy Space Center in Florida. After further tests, it will be wheeled out to the launchpad for a “wet dress rehearsal” in January. That involves the full launch team following exact launch day procedures by testing and fuelling the rocket in a real-life countdown. The first window for the lunar launch opening is in February, officials told reporters on a call on Friday. “The February launch period opens on the 12th and our last opportunity in February is on the 27th,” said Mike Sarafin, Artemis 1 mission manager. The next windows are in March and April.

The mission duration is expected to be four to six weeks. NASA will also deploy small satellites, known as CubeSats, to perform experiments and technology demonstrations. Artemis 2 is then scheduled for 2023 and Artemis 3 for the following year, when humans will walk on the Moon for the first time since 1972. Both missions are now likely to be pushed back, however. NASA says the moonwalkers will include the first woman and first person of colour to make the trip. The space agency is seeking to establish a sustainable presence on the Moon as well as use the lessons it learns to plan a crewed trip to Mars in the 2030s. Orion first flew into space in 2014, launched by a Delta IV rocket, making two circumnavigations of Earth and testing its heat shield on re-entry into the atmosphere. But this time, NASA’s Sarafin said, the capsule will travel much faster and the temperature will be much higher when it returns from the Moon. Artemis 1 has several objectives: To demonstrate Orion’s ability to return from the Moon and operate in deep space where it is “much colder than in low Earth orbit,” and to successfully recover the spacecraft, he added. The mission also plans to study radiation and take selfies of the capsule with the Moon in the background.

""In the last one month, more than 1200 children have been admitted with high fever, cough, cold, and acute respiratory problems and we couldn't save nine of them. They were below six months old and were physically weak. We have tested all the children and all of them have been detected COVID negative,"" the Medical College's Head of the Paediatric Department, Kaustav Nayek said. According to Nayek, all the children who are getting affected are below one year old and the children who are below six months are the most vulnerable to the disease. ""Every time at this time of the year, the children get affected because of season change, but it doesn't stay for more than two weeks... this year it is taking little longer because of the continuous rain. We are taking measures to control the disease,"" he added. According to the doctors, the patient affected by RSV will have a cough and cold in the first two days and then they will develop breathing problems, and, in some cases, it turns out to be serious. ""We have created two additional wards with more than 200 beds to handle this situation. We need oxygen and nebulisers for the treatment and that we have told the Principal. We hope the situation will be under control in the next couple of weeks,"" Nayek said.

Though the doctors claimed that the fever and cough leading to breathing problems are a result of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and has nothing to do with COVID, the huge number of affected children has become a cause of worry for the district health administration. ""In the last one month, more than 1200 children have been admitted with high fever, cough, cold, and acute respiratory problems and we couldn't save nine of them. They were below six months old and were physically weak. We have tested all the children and all of them have been detected COVID negative,"" the Medical College's Head of the Paediatric Department, Kaustav Nayek said. According to Nayek, all the children who are getting affected are below one year old and the children who are below six months are the most vulnerable to the disease. ""Every time at this time of the year, the children get affected because of season change, but it doesn't stay for more than two weeks... this year it is taking little longer because of the continuous rain. We are taking measures to control the disease,"" he added. According to the doctors, the patient affected by RSV will have a cough and cold in the first two days and then they will develop breathing problems, and, in some cases, it turns out to be serious. ""We have created two additional wards with more than 200 beds to handle this situation. We need oxygen and nebulisers for the treatment and that we have told the Principal.

KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 26 ― The blanket ban on political gatherings for the Melaka election campaign will be enforced equally on all parties whether they are pro-government or in the Opposition, Datuk Seri Wan Junaidi Tuanku Jaafar said in the Dewan Rakyat today.The minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Law and Parliament) was responding to Kulim Bandar Baharu MP Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail who sought an assurance from the government that it would apply the law equally on all political parties campaigning in next month’s Melaka state election.The Pakatan Harapan lawmaker suggested the possibility that politicians with the ruling government may attempt to circumvent the ban and meet with constituents to garner support through “official” functions, pointing out that the Opposition would be at a disadvantage when they are prohibited from organising any forms of gatherings related to political campaigning.“What we do not wish for is a double standard. When the government organises, they use the National Security Council’s SOPs. When we organise, they use the Election Commission’s SOPs.“This will create tension and uncontrolled anger. I want to pre-empt the minister. So I want a thorough explanation from YB. If allowed, say it's allowed and if it's disallowed, say it's disallowed,” Saifuddin Nasution said during the Minister’s Question Time.As Melaka is currently under Phase Four of the National Recovery Plan (NRP), official government events are allowed for individuals who have obtained their full vaccination while subjected to the event’s space capacity and physical distancing measures.Wan Junaidi replied that the authorities apply the law equally on all, but added that he will still discuss this issue at the next Cabinet meeting.“Actually we do not practise double standards... and I am speaking on behalf of the Election Commission, NSC and the Health Ministry.“But for now, I cannot give a guarantee about the political activism that is set to take place. But I take note of YB’s question and I will raise this in the next Cabinet meeting to ask ministers to not circumvent the SOPs by KKM and NSC,” he said.NSC refers to the National Security Council, which still issues regulations Covid-19 while KKM refers to the Health Ministry by its Malay initials.On October 24, Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin announced the prohibition of all activities, gatherings or social meetings related to political campaigning for the Melaka polls to prevent the coronavirus from surging again, citing the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act 1988, also known as Act 342.MORE TO COME                                                                                               ",2021-10-26 03:23:41,,,malaymail,"[('Datuk Seri Wan Junaidi Tuanku Jaafar', 'MEDICAL ISSUE'), ('Melaka', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY'), ('KUALA LUMPUR', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY'), ('Melaka', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY'), ('Junaidi Tuanku Jaafar', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY'), ('Melaka', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY'), ('Junaidi', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY'), ('Health Ministry.“But', 'HEALTH ORG'), ('Health Ministry', 'HEALTH ORG'), ('Jamaluddin', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY'), ('Melaka', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY')]",0.0,0.3,0.7

Ministers are under fire as daily cases topped 50,000 for the first time since lockdown ended and 223 people died in one day last week. Brits have been urged to get booster jabs to ‘protect the freedom and Christmas that we have all earned’ by the medical director of NHS England. But a model from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine suggests infections will peak in the coming weeks before nosediving over winter, The Telegraph reports. Experts predict cases could fall by 85% before Christmas in other unpublished models, it’s understood. The dramatic decline in infections ‘will happen without’ the introduction of mandatory face masks, vaccine passports and working from home measures. Sage member John Edmunds, a professor in the Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, said: ‘When we were doing the work about two weeks ago, the Health Secretary had made it very clear that the government was not planning to introduce Plan B in the near future ‘Our model was projecting that cases would start to decline some time in the autumn. ‘However, the model also suggests that cases may start to climb again in the spring, due to a combination of waning immunity and increased contacts.’ Cases in schools are believed to be driving the current coronavirus wave, but top scientists believe this will wane as children’s immunity builds. More than 50,000 daily covid cases were recorded for the first time since 17 July on Thursday (Picture: PA) However, the modelling comes as other experts caution vaccines are not enough to stop Covid. Professor Adam Finn, who is on the Joint Committee of Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), has warned against complacency amid the ‘worsening situation in the NHS’. He told Sky News: ‘The vaccines principally are very effective at stopping people from getting seriously ill. ‘They’re not so effective unfortunately at stopping infections altogether or stopping the virus from being spread about. ‘They do have an effect on that, but they’re not by themselves going to be enough at the present time to keep the spread of the virus under control. ‘And we do need to see people continuing to make efforts to avoid contact, to avoid transmission, and to do other things as well as get vaccinated if we’re going to stop this rise from going up further.’ He added: ‘Just giving more people vaccines, including people who maybe don’t actually need the vaccines yet, could actually run the risk of making things worse rather than better. ‘If you boost people before they actually need the vaccine, it is in some senses a waste of vaccine, but also it means that you are immunising them earlier and they may make a smaller response to the vaccine and that response may wear off earlier. ‘So I think the idea of just getting more doses indiscriminately into people’s arms is not really necessarily going to solve the problem.’ Health Secretary Sajid Javid is said to have set up a ‘war room’ where he is holding daily meetings on how to tackle the crisis. Labour has called for Plan B to be imposed immediately, with Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves claiming the vaccine programme is ‘stalling’. The Government is likely to introduce mandatory jabs for NHS staff to protect the vulnerable, despite warnings of legal challenges. Mr Javid said a final decision had not been taken yet ‘but it is something that I’m heading towards’. He told Times Radio: ‘We’ve been very clear and open about this, working with our friends in the NHS, and the reason for this is if you’re working in the NHS, that fantastic work you’re doing every day, you yourself are more susceptible to this virus because you’re just much more likely to come into contact with it, but also the people that you’re looking after are more vulnerable and that’s why they’re in hospital, they’ve got health needs, and this is about protecting them and protecting yourself.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.

An advisory panel for the FDA will consider that company's application on Tuesday.Top health officials, like Dr. Anthony Fauci, have said they believe the vaccine will be approved for emergency use in kids and the U.S. could start seeing the age group being vaccinated in early November.“So if all goes well, and we get the regulatory approval, and the recommendations from the CDC, it's entirely possible, if not, very likely that vaccines will be available for children from 5 to 11 within the first week or two of November,” said Fauci told CNN on Sunday.",2021-10-25 14:28:54,,,wcpo,"[('Food and Drug Administration', 'HEALTH ORG'), ('FDA', 'HEALTH ORG'), ('Pfizer', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY'), ('FDA', 'HEALTH ORG'), ('CDC', 'MEDICAL ISSUE')]",1.0,0.0,0.2

However, one curious Reddit user might’ve just spotted the prices for their upcoming Intel Arc GPUs thanks to Intel themselves. Intel had launched a ‘Xe HPG Scavenger Hunt’ website back in March of this year, as part of their marketing for their graphics division. As its name suggests, it’s a scavenger hunt of sorts where there’ll be 10 clues handed out by Intel and their partners, and participants will need to put it all together and submit an answer to stand a chance of winning their prizes. According to their terms and conditions, they’ll start releasing the clues from the end of October till the end of January next year. As part of the prize pool, Intel will send out one of their ‘premium’ Intel Arc graphics cards, some Intel Arc merch and a six month subscription for Xbox Game Pass for PC to 100 grand prize winners, with a stated total approximate retail value of USD900. Doing some quick math, six months of Xbox Game Pass for PC will be USD60, while the included merch could be anywhere from USD40 to USD60 at most, with the Intel Store listing an Intel Arc Jersey for USD53.65. This means that Intel’s top of the line Arc graphics card could be priced around the USD800 mark. Similarly, Intel will also be giving away the more ‘performance’ oriented Intel Arc graphics cards, Intel Arc merch and a three month subscription for Xbox Game Pass for PC to 200 1st place prize winners with a stated total retail value of USD700. Taking away the cost of the merch and Xbox Game Pass subscription, their performance graphics cards could be priced at around USD630. Unfortunately, if you were planning to join the Xe HPG Scavenger Hunt yourself, you’ll be disappointed to know that it’s not open to Malaysians at the moment. Nevertheless, it’s intriguing to see Intel perhaps unwittingly hinting at their retail pricing of their upcoming graphics cards. While these numbers do seem a little pricey right now, it should be pointed out that it’s still speculation for now, with no official word from Intel. Performance of their graphics cards also remain to be seen, though based on early leaks is expected to be between the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 and RTX 3080 for the highest tier premium GPU. According to Intel themselves, their Arc graphics cards ought to debut sometime in Q1 of 2022.

Vodafone's Rs 500 data plan outperforms Jio; Check out,https://www.thehansindia.com/technology/tech-news/vodafones-rs-500-data-plan-outperforms-jio-check-out-712416,"['Tech,Tech News']",['Kahekashan'],,"Both Vodafone and Jio offer a data plan that is priced at around Rs 500, offering special OTT services alongside the usual data benefits. Here's a quick look at both plans to see how they stack up in terms of value for money.","Vodafone's Rs 500 data plan outperforms JioVodafone's Rs 500 data plan outperforms JioThere's is tough competition between India's three main telecom operators, Vodafone Idea (Vi), Jio and Airtel, users are offered lucrative plans and services when they subscribe to prepaid and postpaid plans. With gigabytes of data being offered daily, many of these plans also offer access to specific OTT services, similar to how broadband services now offer bundled subscriptions these days.When it comes to streaming videos and other content, a proper data plan is required if WiFi is not available. Both Vodafone and Jio offer plans priced around Rs 500, offering users data and the ability to access their favourite streaming services. However, if users must choose between these two packages, it is important to understand the benefits that both operators offer. Vodafone prepaid Data Plan of Rs 500 Vodafone Idea has kept the competition with Jio strong with its Rs 499 prepaid data plan that comes with 3GB of data, unlimited calls, and 100 SMS every day. Vodafone prepaid data plan of Rs 500 is valid for 28 days. As a result, users get 84GB of data, which Vi expands to 100GB thanks to an additional 16GB of data. While this plan actually offers more data, the real benefit of subscribing to Vi's data plan is weekend data transfer and late-night binge deals, which users can take advantage of to increase their data usage further. of the package assignment. In terms of OTT services, Vi subscribers get access to Disney + Hotstar's mobile-only plan, which otherwise costs Rs 499 per year. Jio Prepaid Data Plan of Rs 499Jio's prepaid data plan that competes with Vi's offering is a data package that costs Rs 499 and is also valid for a period of 28 days. Users are offered 3GB of data every day, just like the other plan with unlimited calls and 100 SMS every day. With 3GB of data every day, users can access up to 84GB in a month, and Jio offers an additional 6GB, bringing the total to 90GB. This is still 10GB less than what Vi offers in its Rs 501 data package.In terms of OTT services, users will get access to the same Disney + Hotstar streaming plan for mobile, while also getting access to JioTV and JioCinema.

Maybe it’s the stranger who wandered into your family photo, or the stand holding up your final artwork for school? Whatever the job, if you don’t have the time or Photoshop skills needed to edit the thing yourself, why not try Cleanup.pictures — a handy web tool that does exactly what it promises in the URL. Just upload your picture, paint over the thing you want removed with the brush tool, and hey presto: new image. The results aren’t up to the standards of professionals, especially if the picture is particularly busy or complex, but they’re surprisingly good. The tool is also just quite fun to play around with. You can check out some examples in the gallery below: Cleanup.pictures seems to be from the same team that made a fun augmented reality demo that lets you “copy and paste” the real world, and is open-source (you can find the underlying code here). Obviously, tools of this sort have long been available, dating back at least to the launch of Photoshop’s Clone Stamp tool, but the quality of these automated programs has increased considerably in recent years thanks to AI. Machine learning systems are now not only better at the problem of segmentation (marking the divisions between an object and the background) but also inpainting, or filling in the new content. Just last week, Google launched its new Pixel 6 tools with an identical “Magic Eraser” feature, but Cleanup.pictures shows how this feature has become a commodity.

That was the question on my mind when I walked out to the parking lot to get into my car and it was not there. Given that Halloween was just a few days away, I naturally suspected that perhaps a ghost had decided to take my car for a spin. Seems like those ghosts don’t get much of a chance to spirit away an everyday car. I put aside the ghost theory and sought to find something more down-to-earth as an explanation for where my car was. This particular parking lot was quite expansive and there wasn’t any numbering system associated with the parking spots. Thus, I had to remember where my car was supposed to be as based entirely on my own mental “global positioning” brain ware, and absent of having any tangible and more reliable form of tracing. Relying on my noggin alone was not a sure bet. I was pretty sure that the parking spot of my car was next to a lamppost and about midway down a row of cars that was visually aligned with a sandwich shop outside of the fenced perimeter of the parking lot. That seems byzantine, I realize. Hey, at least it was a means to pin down generally where my car had to be. But my car was not where it was supposed to be. Indeed, it wasn’t anywhere near to where it was supposed to be. I stood in the presumed parking spot and looked all around me, stretching on my tippy toes and scanned the horizon like a sailor desperately trying to spy land ahoy. You might be thinking that I ought to remember what other cars were parked next to my car and thus I could just look for that pattern of say a red pickup truck and a yellow sportscar that were next to me. Unfortunately, this gambit wasn’t going to work out. I had parked my car very early in the morning that day, and it was now quite late in the evening. Most of the cars in this particular lot had turned over and a newer crop of cars had gradually entered into and parked here and there.

I routinely parked in this specific lot and had to jockey each day to discover an available empty space. As a result, each day my car was parked in some semi-randomly chosen spot such that I never knew beforehand where an open spot might exist. This all meant that I could readily be thinking about where I parked yesterday , rather than accurately remembering where I parked today. I decided that the brute force method of searching was required in this instance. I stridently walked up-and-down every row of the parking lot. This was done slowly and cautiously, wanting to make sure that I did not go hastily and inadvertently miss seeing my car. I assumed that by methodically searching, I would certainly find my car and the whole affair would be laughed off as a quirky moment of existence. If I were to sprint around in a panic, I figured it would only make me more panicky and I would be unlikely to detect my car, therefore end-up not finding it and shamefully enter into a mind-bending berserk mode accordingly. Well, the thoughtfully crafted brute force approach failed to unearth my car, which ostensibly meant that it was indeed missing. I was now begrudgingly convinced that my car was no longer in this parking lot. I knew absolutely that I had parked there. I knew absolutely that I was not somehow in the wrong parking lot. I knew for sure that I had not gotten a lift that morning or otherwise gotten to work by a method other than driving my car. Yes, the car was supposed to be here and it wasn’t, that was unnervingly the plain and agonizing truth. What did the heck happen to my car (I say that, minus the dude part, respectively)? I have already now covered the possibility that I had “misplaced” my car in terms of having thought it was in one spot and yet perhaps it was sitting quietly in another spot. So, misplacement was no longer on the list of possibilities. If my car wasn’t there, it must have been moved. I realize that seems blatantly obvious. Sorry, but that’s what goes through your mind when the shock of having a missing car strikes you to the bone. I liked my car. It was my favorite car of all the cars I’ve owned to date. Even if I didn’t somehow favor the car, nonetheless it was my car and it ought to be ready and waiting for me. Well, how could my car have been moved? One possibility that came to mind was that my car had been towed. Maybe my car was illegally parked while it was sitting in the parking lot. I have no idea how that could be, though perhaps some obscure parking rule had gotten my vehicle in trouble. Or perhaps my car had done something wrong, such as the horn suddenly squawking and nobody could stand the blaring sounds, so the parking lot management had my vehicle towed out of there. I summarily rejected the notion that aliens from another planet had beamed-up my car. That kind of thinking is fun when making a movie script or playing wild what-if games, but when your prized car is really gone, the practical ways of how it came to be missing are more valued and prudent to consider. There wasn’t an attendant in the parking lot. Near the exit gate, there was a payment kiosk and it had a red button to remotely make contact with someone associated with the parking aspects. I used the red button. Speaking to a human voice that emitted from a rather balky speaker, we determined that the parking establishment had not towed my car. Of course, someone else could have come into the parking lot and towed it, like one of the bounty hunter episodes. That fleeting thought was instantly rejected as being nearly equal to the alien invasion from Mars. Okay, it was now down to the remaining possibility that someone drove my car off the lot. I was the only person with a key to my car. If I had loaned out my spare key to someone else, they would immediately be a suspect in this budding crime scene. Those comedic shows where they pull a gag on someone can at times involve enlisting a friend of the unsuspecting dupe that then helps to drive off with their car, or subtly move it, sparking the person to be baffled at how their car was in a different spot than expected. This was inapplicable in my case. Anyway, it now seemed apparent that someone unknown to me had spirited away with my car. They must have devilishly gotten into my car and used one of those insidious under-the-dashboard sneaks to start my car and drive it away. Sadness ensued. I reported the matter to the police. They informed me that the odds were that my car was long gone by the time I had reported it missing. Having grown up watching TV shows that involve an all-points bulletin of citywide searches for a missing whatever, I was disappointed to discover that not only was such a street-by-street search not going to be undertaken, but there were also lots of other cars stolen on that day. In that sense, my stolen car was one of many and now was a statistic rather than something that had seemed very personal and personable to me. Shifting gears, the future of cars involves the emergence of self-driving cars. Here is today’s interesting question: Is it possible for an AI-based true self-driving car to go missing, and if so, what happens next? Let’s unpack the matter and see. Understanding The Levels Of Self-Driving Cars As a clarification, true self-driving cars are ones that the AI drives the car entirely on its own and there isn’t any human assistance during the driving task. These driverless vehicles are considered Level 4 and Level 5 (see my explanation at this link here ), while a car that requires a human driver to co-share the driving effort is usually considered at Level 2 or Level 3. The cars that co-share the driving task are described as being semi-autonomous, and typically contain a variety of automated add-on’s that are referred to as ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems). There is not yet a true self-driving car at Level 5, which we don’t yet even know if this will be possible to achieve, and nor how long it will take to get there. Meanwhile, the Level 4 efforts are gradually trying to get some traction by undergoing very narrow and selective public roadway trials, though there is controversy over whether this testing should be allowed per se (we are all life-or-death guinea pigs in an experiment taking place on our highways and byways, some contend, see my coverage at this link here ). Since semi-autonomous cars require a human driver, the adoption of those types of cars won’t be markedly different than driving conventional vehicles, so there’s not much new per se to cover about them on this topic (though, as you’ll see in a moment, the points next made are generally applicable). For semi-autonomous cars, it is important that the public needs to be forewarned about a disturbing aspect that’s been arising lately, namely that despite those human drivers that keep posting videos of themselves falling asleep at the wheel of a Level 2 or Level 3 car, we all need to avoid being misled into believing that the driver can take away their attention from the driving task while driving a semi-autonomous car. You are the responsible party for the driving actions of the vehicle, regardless of how much automation might be tossed into a Level 2 or Level 3. Self-Driving Cars And When They Go Missing For Level 4 and Level 5 true self-driving vehicles, there won’t be a human driver involved in the driving task. All occupants will be passengers. The AI is doing the driving. First, let’s dispense with the idea that the AI is somehow sentient. It is not. The AI of today is programmed and involves the same everyday kind of computers as found in your smartphone or laptop. To clarify, yes there are specialized computer processors that are built to aid in self-driving activities, such as chips that can process Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms rapidly, but those are still in the realm of conventional computing. I bring this up due to the interest in addressing the question about what happens if a self-driving car goes missing. We can reject outright the possibility that the AI of its own accord might drive the vehicle away from a particular place or parking spot. If the AI driving system drives the vehicle, it is because there is some everyday world reason for it. Thus, this does not include the AI as a sentient being that somehow decides today is the day it will go for a drive and showcase its freedom from the bonds of mankind (for my discussion about those kinds of futuristic and rather outsized notions, see the link here ). Let’s consider the reasonable possibilities for why a self-driving car might go missing. When my conventional car was missing, I initially assumed that I had “misplaced” my car. This meant that I was potentially confused about where I had last left my car. Perhaps I had parked it in place X and my mind was trying to convince me that I had parked it in place Y. The car was still sitting in place X and therefore was right where it was to start with. The alleged movement was only in my mind. Is it feasible for a self-driving car to get “misplaced” in the same manner as a conventional car? A fair answer to that question is that yes, it is conceivable. Suppose you owned a self-driving car and you parked it in the same parking lot as to where I work. You could readily do the same thing I did, namely coming back out later on and not be able to immediately find the self-driving car. In my case, it really was gone, but it was seemingly equally likely that I could have failed to remember accurately where it was parked. The beauty of a self-driving car is likely to be that it can be remotely activated and retrieved. A conventional car won’t drive itself to you. The best that most conventional cars can do is wink their headlights and toot their horn when you try to access them remotely. A true self-driving car would be able to properly and safely pull out of a parking spot and drive to wherever you might be standing and waiting for it to arrive (doing so entirely autonomously, and no human hand or guidance involved). In that sense, it is going to be very hard to misplace your self-driving car per se. No matter where your self-driving car was originally parked, it doesn’t especially matter, since it can find its way to you, assuming that it can be accessed remotely. I emphasize this remote access facet due to the off-chance that the electronic communications to your self-driving car are unable to function, perhaps being in a remote area or having some other form of communications networking issues. In that case, you would presumably have no means of alerting the self-driving car that it is needed and that it ought to startup and come to you. Likewise, if the self-driving car is out of battery charge and does not have the needed electrical energy to function, this also implies that you would not be able to remotely communicate with the vehicle. The proverbial dead battery is apt to make the self-driving car into a multi-ton paperweight, which of course could be said of any conventional car too. The point overall is that you could “misplace” a self-driving car, though finding it is altogether going to be relatively easy since you won’t search for it, and instead it will search for you (or, more likely, come to you). There is an added twist to this misplacement aspect. Since the self-driving car can drive itself, there is a chance that it might have opted to move from the parking spot that it was originally left in. With a conventional car, there is no chance that the car will opt to move (a human might do so, but not by the acts of the car alone). This suggests that if you did decide to walk out to find your self-driving car, it readily might not be in the original parked spot. The AI could have chosen to move the vehicle. Why would the AI do such a thing? Again, it is not as a result of sentience. Put aside any anthropomorphizing of today’s AI. The rational and easily explainable reason could be that the AI might have been programmed to detect adverse conditions while being parked. For example, suppose another car was backing into a spot that was head-to-head with the parked self-driving car. If the AI driving system was active, it might detect this danger, and start the car to move it away from getting dinged by the other car. The AI might then seek a different parking spot. In theory, the AI driving system would then send out an electronic message to indicate it had moved. The fleet operator or perhaps the owner would hopefully get dutifully notified. In any case, regardless of whether a notification was to occur, the notion is that the AI driving system can move the car, doing so for some programmatic reason. Indeed, it could be that the fleet operator opted to remotely activate the self-driving car, sending it to a local carwash. Unbeknownst to you, the AI driving system drove the self-driving car and left the parking lot, drove to a carwash, went through the carwash, perhaps refueled, and came back to the parking lot. All of that might take place without your awareness. That being said, this is somewhat farfetched in that if you owned the self-driving car, the odds are that the fleet operator would likely inform you of such actions. As an aside, some pundits reject wholescale the idea that individuals will own self-driving cars. The logic is that self-driving cars will only be owned in large fleets and by sizable companies, such as major automakers, major ridesharing firms, and the like. I am known for my contrarian stance that argues there will be individual ownership of self-driving cars (see my discussion at this link here ). I bring up this particular point because some would insist that you will never have a self-driving car and therefore never be able to “lose” a self-driving car (obviously, if you don’t have one, you can’t somehow lose it or misplace it). The future will consist of people always riding in self-driving cars on a ridesharing basis. A self-driving car will pick you up and take you to your destination. At no juncture will you care about where the self-driving car is parked. All that you know is that it appears when you need it, and it goes away when you don’t need it. For the moment, go with me on the perspective that people will be able to individually own a self-driving car. If you are agreeable to giving that notion some airtime, it means that we can continue the discussion about what happens when a self-driving car goes missing (which, as an aside, can be said to even apply when owned by a fleet, since the fleet owner could have similar concerns arise). Here’s where we are on this matter. A self-driving car that is parked can readily move from the parking spot. In contrast, a conventional car cannot readily be moved. It can be towed, of course. It can be driven by a human too. Each of those actions is somewhat harder to pull off than the same act of moving a self-driving car. With a self-driving car, there is an AI driving system in the car and ready to go, and for which can act somewhat on its own (perhaps pre-programmed to leave the parking lot at a particular time of day) or by remote activation. Could a self-driving car be towed? Yes, absolutely. We all need to realize that self-driving cars are in fact going to be towed from time to time. A self-driving car is still a car. Cars have various mechanical failures and breakdowns. An AI driving system cannot drive a car that is broken, any more than a human could drive such a vehicle. As such, you should not be surprised to witness self-driving cars getting towed to repair shops (see my coverage at this link here ). Could a human steal a self-driving car by breaking into the vehicle and driving it off? For a conventional car, a criminal can potentially break into a car, start the car, and drive it away. A quite natural question arises as to whether a human could do the same to a self-driving car. Well, eventually, the idea is that true self-driving cars won’t have any human-accessible driving controls. The thinking is that it will be best to prevent humans from driving cars since otherwise, they will continue to drive while drunk and drive while distracted. The hope is that by making self-driving cars only drivable by an AI driving system, we can reduce dramatically the number of car crashes and car-related fatalities and injuries. If that comes to pass, which not everyone agrees will necessarily happen, there won’t be any direct means for a car thief to drive away with a stolen car. They might be able to break into the self-driving car. They won’t have access to the driving controls. The odds are that self-driving cars will employ some form of Natural Language Processing (NLP) system for human riders to be able to tell the AI driving system where the person wants to go. In that case, presumably, the thief that has broken into a self-driving car could try to verbally instruct the AI driving system to spirit away with the car. This seems an unlikely scenario in that the odds are that NLP for AI driving systems will potentially use various security measures to make sure that the instructions being given are coming from the appropriate source. All told, the breaking into the vehicle is most certainly going to be detected by the AI driving system and that alone would setoff various alarms and alerts. A crook that then frantically tries to command the AI to drive away is bound to get nowhere. And, some predict that we will rarely have self-driving cars stolen at all. The sensors of the self-driving car will capture on video the car thief. The electronic communications of the self-driving car can instantly send out a message to the police and other authorities. Without any readily accessible driving controls, the thief cannot just hotwire the vehicle and drive away. Stealing a self-driving car also doesn’t make much sense for other various important reasons. For example, most self-driving cars will automatically be in touch with the fleet operator to indicate where the car is, what its status consists of, where it is going, etc. This is a vital form of traceability and monitoring by the fleet operator. A car thief would be tracked and generally unable to sneak away with the self-driving car (unless they could use some form of cybersecurity hacks to subvert or avoid the tracing, see my columns covering that looming prospect). Conclusion The good news is that stealing a self-driving car is going to be a tough crime to successfully commit. Even if a thief decided to steal a self-driving car via the act of towing (rather than driving off with the vehicle), the odds are that the towing action would readily be detected by the AI driving system and would emit automatically an electronic tipoff to the fleet operator that something has gone amiss. The somewhat unsettling news is that wherever you believe that you parked your self-driving car, there are lots of valid reasons why it might not be there anymore. At the same time, it won’t especially matter to you. You can park your car and forget where you parked it, doing so to your heart’s content. Almost akin to a beloved dog like Lassie, the AI driving system can come and find you when the time arises for you to need a ride. To clarify, the AI won’t be showering you with love and affection, and don’t expect those cherished canine slobbering kisses, since the self-driving car will only be doing what it was programmed to do. Perhaps someday we will have sentient AI, in which case the AI might be happy to see you, though the downside is that the AI might arbitrarily decide that it doesn’t want to give you a ride and will refuse to come and pick you up. We might need special Blade Runner -style bounty hunters that can wrangle those ornery AI driving systems that have decided purposely to go missing.",https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/0x0/filters%3Aformat%28jpg%29/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/616f63a78381218bc51e3a22/0x0.jpg?cropX1=104&cropX2=2024&cropY1=0&cropY2=1408,forbes,[],0.0,0.4,0.8

Ollie Barder Following on from the breakdown of the new Diaclone Big Powered GV toy, it seems only fitting to cover the flipside to that and feature the bad guys of Diaclone , the voracious Waruder . With Diaclone being the good guys back before Transformers was created, they needed the evil Waruder as an antagonist. So when Takara Tomy came to reboot the Diaclone toyline, the Waruder came along as well. Most of the new Waruder enemies are based around the Waruder Suits , which can combine in an almost infinite manner due to the modular nature of the suit itself. Inside each suit is a Warudaroid, these are the Waruder “pilots” but are actually closer to something like the Borg from Star Trek . This is because the Waruder don’t just destroy things, they actually want to capture and repurpose the Dia-Nauts . The Waruder are also somewhat hive minded, which is why the various Diaclone mecha have to be so multi-purpose to combat this threat.

Like the Diaclone mecha, the Warudaros is modular in terms of its assembly and has various forms. The two main modes though are a giant dinosaur like mecha and a humanoid mecha that is really rather massive. The build quality of the Warudaros is really very good, as the toy is nicely sturdy and very posable. Even across the various modes, the articulation is surprisingly thorough. The sculpt and detailing are also great throughout and really sell the whole insect inspiration from the Waruder, which brings me on to Transformers . As the Waruder were part of the old Diaclone range , they too became some of the original Transformers (along with a variety of Microman toys). In the case of the original Waruder , they became the Insecticons that were part of the Decepticon ranks. This insect-like design has since carried over to the newer Diaclone toys, with the Warudaros being a rather large example of that. The fact it also has a dinosaur mode also feeds into the decades long fascination with kaiju in Japan. So having the Diaclone forces face off against a mechanical monster feels very fitting. While these newer Diaclone toys do harken back to their 80s brethren, it’s very clear that these new toys are very much their own thing now. Yes, the Diaclone brand evokes a certain amount of nostalgia, but these new toys offer an awful lot more and are clearly aimed at an older demographic anyway. So if you’re curious about these new Diaclone toys from Takara Tomy, then places like HobbyLink Japan have some of the newer iterations in case you want to pick them up. Now if only Takara Tomy would make a Diaclone game.

The new 14-inch MacBook Pro is already $50 off at Amazon,https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/10/25/22744535/apple-macbook-pro-amazon-airpods-magsafe-google-pixel-6-buds-deal-sale,,['Cameron Faulkner'],,,"Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales Last week, Apple introduced its new generation of MacBook Pro laptops, featuring a new design (complete with a notched screen) and faster M1 chips. If you had your eye on the 14-inch model instead of the 16-inch MacBook Pro, you can save just a little bit of cash on it when you preorder at Amazon. The configuration that has the M1 Pro chip (eight-core CPU, 14-core GPU), 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD is $1,949.99 instead of $2,000. A $50 discount isn’t a whole lot, but it’s something. Verge editor-in-chief Nilay Patel just posted first impressions of his time with the latest MacBook Pro. It’s not a review (stay tuned for that), but check it out if you want to see some fresh images, along with takeaways from real-world usage of the M1 Pro and M1 Max chips. Another product that Apple recently debuted is discounted at Amazon. The new AirPods Pro that ship with a MagSafe charging case are $220 instead of Apple’s $249 price. In terms of features and specs, these are the same wireless earbuds that first shipped in 2019 — you can find those now for $197. It’s just the case that’s new here, and while we haven’t tested them yet (and thus, don’t know if the case has improved charging speeds or if it’s just magnetized), this is a decent deal I’d recommend for first-time AirPods Pro buyers who want everything they own to have MagSafe compatibility. If you’re interested in preordering a Google Pixel 6 or Pixel 6 Pro, Best Buy still has stock of the phones and is including a free set of Pixel Buds A-series wireless earbuds at checkout through Wednesday, October 27th. Those normally cost $100, so this is a solid incentive. Google unveiled the Pixel 6 phones last week, and the highlight was on the promising, new Google Tensor chip inside of both of them. Check out the video above for more details. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge While this isn’t technically a deal, it’s worth sharing that Microsoft’s Xbox Series S console is currently available at Best Buy for its normal $300 price. It was tough to find for several months following its debut in late 2020, and you may want to pick one up now if you planned to give it as a gift during the holidays.

Teachmint, one such startup that is helping teachers create their own virtual classrooms with a few taps on their smartphones, has raised $78 million in its Series B financing round, TechCrunch has learned and confirmed. Rocketship.vc and Vulcan Capital co-led the new round, the startup said on Monday. The new round values the 16-month-old Indian edtech firm at $500 million, according to two people familiar with the matter. Mihir Gupta, co-founder and chief executive of Teachmint, confirmed the size of the new funding round in a text message, but declined to comment on the valuation. Goodwater Capital and Epiq Capital as well as existing investors Learn Capital, CM Ventures, Lightspeed India and Better Capital also participated in the round, he said. The new investment comes months after the startup was approached by one of the two Indian edtech giants that offered the startup a $400 million acquisition price, according to three sources familiar with the matter. Teachmint declined the offer. The startup, which began its journey just weeks after the pandemic broke, is building what it calls the “ed-infra” for teachers in India to help them take online classes, engage with students virtually, assign them tasks, conduct attendance and also collect fees. This approach is different from edtech giants such as Byju’s, Unacademy, and Vedantu, where teachers directly don’t have a relationship with their students. And Teachmint’s model is working. The startup has amassed over 10 million users in the country, it said. “Since inception, we have been laser-focused on addressing the big technology-infrastructure gap that exists in education. Over the past 16 months, we have been humbled by the experience of powering the teaching and learning infrastructure for millions of teachers and students across India,” said Gupta. “From supporting individual teachers to powering K-12 schools, coaching institutes, colleges, universities and even EdTechs, we are disrupting technology penetration in education at an unprecedented pace. We are thrilled to welcome onboard Rocketship.vc and Vulcan Capital along with Goodwater Capital and Epiq Capital. We are also grateful to have the continuous support of our existing investors as we execute our vision at the global stage.” The startup said it will deploy the fresh capital to hire talent across product, technology, and design roles and will also soon offers its employees its biggest stock buyback option.

Russian hackers targeting US networks in ‘very large and ongoing’ cyberattack,https://nypost.com/2021/10/25/russian-hackers-target-us-networks-in-ongoing-cyberattack/,,['Emily Crane'],,Russian-linked hackers blamed for the massive cyberattack on the US last year have been targeting hundreds of companies and organizations in its latest wave of attacks on US-based computer networks.,Russian-linked hackers blamed for the massive cyberattack on the US last year have been targeting hundreds of companies and organizations in its latest wave of attacks on US-based computer networks.,2021-10-25 12:57:44,"Russian-linked hackers blamed for the massive cyberattack on the US last year have been targeting hundreds of companies and organizations in its latest wave of attacks on US-based computer networks — as the White House dismisses the incident as “unsophisticated, run-of-the mill operations.” In a blog post Sunday , Microsoft said Nobelium – the Russian-based agency behind last years’ widespread SolarWinds attack – has been targeting cloud service providers and technology service organizations in a bid to obtain data. The attacks have targeted organizations in the US and Europe since May, Microsoft said. One of Microsoft’s top security officers Tom Burt told the New York Times , which first reported the breach, that the latest attack was “very large and ongoing.” “Nobelium has been attempting to replicate the approach it has used in past attacks by targeting organizations integral to the global IT supply chain. This time, it is attacking a different part of the supply chain: resellers and other technology service providers that customize, deploy and manage cloud services and other technologies on behalf of their customers,” Microsoft said in its blog post. “We believe Nobelium ultimately hopes to piggyback on any direct access that resellers may have to their customers’ IT systems and more easily impersonate an organization’s trusted technology partner to gain access to their downstream customers.” Microsoft said it had notified 609 customers between July 1 and Oct. 19 they had been attacked. The company insisted only a small percent of the latest attempts were successful. “This recent activity is another indicator that Russia is trying to gain long-term, systematic access to a variety of points in the technology supply chain and establish a mechanism for surveilling – now or in the future – targets of interest to the Russian government,” Microsoft said. “The attacks we’ve observed in the recent campaign against resellers and service providers have not attempted to exploit any flaw or vulnerability in software but rather used well-known techniques, like password spray and phishing, to steal legitimate credentials and gain privileged access.” Microsoft said it had learned enough about these new attacks to provide information that “can be used to defend against this new approach.” A Biden administration official told the Times the latest attacks were “unsophisticated, run-of-the mill operations that could have been prevented if the cloud service providers had implemented baseline cybersecurity practices.” “We can do a lot of things… but the responsibility to implement simple cybersecurity practices to lock their — and by extension, our — digital doors rests with the private sector,” the official said. The US government blamed Russia for the major breach of government agencies last year known as the SolarWinds hack.

Eternals dreams big and falls hard,https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22741019/eternals-review-marvel,,['Joshua Rivera'],,,Image: Marvel Studios Confusing comics characters make for a very messy movie Continue reading…,2021-10-24 18:00:00,"Chloé Zhao’s 2020 film Nomadland begins with a few sparse lines of text that set up an entire world of loss. A sheetrock plant in the real-life town of Empire, Nevada, shuts down in January 2011. In six months’ time, Empire’s zip code is discontinued. It’s a ghost town. A stable-seeming environment is revealed to be constantly in flux, sometimes with frightening and destabilizing speed. Eternals , Zhao’s follow-up to her acclaimed Academy Award-winning film, also begins with explanatory text. This time however, it’s more lore than story, about beings from another planet brought to ours for a purpose the audience won’t fully grasp until the end of the film. It is withholding and not inviting, as if, from the very start, there are two forces at war for the kind of film Eternals should be. The latest film from Marvel Studios is equal parts puzzle piece and experiment. Eternals expands the frontiers of the MCU providing hints about what its future may hold while also being a project of formal ambition. Zhao deliberately breaks from the well-established Marvel formula to tell a more sweeping and mature story — the sort of story the filmmaker is known for. The script takes the sort of seismic shifts that can happen around us in six brief months and blows them up on a geologic scale across thousands of years, through the eyes of the most consciously diverse cast in a superhero blockbuster. Eternals , however, is ultimately haunted by that formula, continually yielding to the familiar whenever it tries to show us something new. Eternals is also saddled with one of the densest premises in Marvel Comics history, a relative anomaly in the large stable of memorable characters created by comics legend Jack Kirby. Even the considerably streamlined film version can’t lay the groundwork without heaps of exposition: The Eternals, the film’s opening text describes, are superhuman champions from a world called Olympia, dispatched to Earth by a cosmic god named Arimesh, a Celestial, in order to defend humankind from the monstrous Deviants. Throughout history, the Eternals have been here, helping humanity by fighting off Deviants and slowly providing technological advancement — to a certain point. Because the Eternals have another mandate: They cannot interfere in Earthly conflicts that don’t involve the Deviants. This is the reason the film gives — in an actual conversation, between characters — for The Eternals taking a raincheck on Thanos’ genocidal rampage or any of the horrors and atrocities of the past. It’s a bit hard to swallow, especially when the film goes to great special-effects lengths to depict historical moments of mass destruction. To the film’s credit, part of Eternals narrative arc is its characters wrestling with the morality of this mandate. The misfortune of putting this dilemma to characters who live for thousands of years is pretty simple: The longer the characters take to let awful stuff happen before they do something about it, the more they seem like chumps. In the present day, however, it’s pretty easy for the Eternals to follow this mandate. All of the Deviants on Earth have been wiped out, but instead of being offered a ticket to their home, Olympia, they’ve been effectively abandoned by their god and gone their separate ways, living in secret among the people of Earth. The exposition pauses and the action begins when Sersi (Gemma Chan) and Sprite (Lia McHugh), who live in London as a teacher and an (eternal) 12-year-old, respectively, are attacked by a not-so-extinct Deviant who also seems strong enough to kill Eternals. When the Superman-esque Ikaris (Richard Madden) arrives to help fend the Deviant off, a mini Eternals reunion becomes a full-blown road trip to get the family back together and figure out what’s going on with the Deviants. From here, Eternals becomes a hybrid travelogue and historical epic. As Sersi, Ikkaris, and Sprite reunite with their seven other “siblings” across the globe, the film flashes back to pivotal moments of their time on Earth, reflecting on their relationships with each other and humanity. They’re in Mesopotamia in 5000 B.C. kickstarting the Bronze Age; then they’re in Babylon in 575 B.C. seeding the wonders of the Hanging Gardens; then they’re in 1575 Mexico waching in shock as genocide Spanish colonists murder the people of Tenochtitlan. In cross cutting from one era to another, Zhao begins to emphasize place more than anything else — even action scenes seem to fade to take a backseat, a momentary interruption to the interpersonal drama of the Eternals as they question their role in the places around them. They fall in and out of love with each other, and humanity. They meet and are rebuffed by their god, Arishem the Celestial. They spend most of the film in doubt, unsure of what to do or believe. But Eternals is contemplative to a fault. Every time a new character is introduced, the ones we’ve previously met re-explain the story, and the same agreements and disagreements play out. In the best moments, Zhao allows the film to breathe around its most well-realized characters, like Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) who has settled into life as a Bollywood star and joins up because he wants to turn the adventure into a documentary about him saving the world with his ridiculously powerful finger guns. Less bombastic but equally compelling is Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), the Eternal inventor who, out of guilt for accelerating human technology to atomic war is possible, has retreated into a quiet domestic life with his human husband and son in the suburbs. The film’s cast is too big to give every character a fulfilling arc, but the film’s script by Zhao, Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo, and Kaz Firpo devotes most of the film’s runtime to its least compelling characters. Sersi, with her vague power to transmute inanimate matter from one form to another, most effectively shown off when she turns a speeding bus into rose petals, is the de facto protagonist, but also a listless one: She is torn between her life pretending to be mortal and dating her historian boyfriend Dane (Kit Harington) and her grander purpose, which she starts to question, but only when forced to. It’s almost like the Eternals take their vow of nonintervention so seriously that they also refuse to drive the film’s plot. Much has been made about what Chloé Zhao brings to the MCU as a filmmaker, largely stemming from Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige gushing over her insistence that Eternals be filmed on real locations , and not largely on green-screened soundstages, as many Marvel films are. The result is distinctive, but also strangely hollow. It’s as if, in order to accomodate the needs of a Marvel blockbuster, Eternals could only stage its action in the most barren of natural environments: A beach, a forest, a desert. Places big and open enough that a soundstage could be approximated, however begrudgingly. When it’s time for the naturalism of the film to give way to artificial action, the result is surprisingly demure — with one spectacular exception at the very end, Eternals’ action is quite small; a strange contrast to its grand scope. When the heroes “suit up” for their final fight, it almost feels wrong, or reluctant. The pat descriptors Marvel executives like Kevin Feige append to MCU films don’t hang so neatly on Eternals . Genre shorthand does a poor job of conveying what a viewer should expect. There are no heists, no spycraft, no strange new worlds nor hidden fantasy realms. Eternals is a meandering film about being estranged from your family, and how difficult it is to get the stones up to finally see them again. It’s two and a half hours full of people many thousands of years old going from place to place and talking about the good old days. After over a decade of the MCU formula’s dominance, it’s easy to mistake Eternals ’ deviance for profundity. Films that wrestle with difficult experiences can often be difficult to watch, and intentionally so. Unfortunately, Eternals isn’t bold, merely incongruous. The simpler explanation is truer: Eternals is a mess. It’s a movie concerned with conveying scale, about big ideas and forces that move on a geologic timetable beyond any one life. It wrestles with a morality that stretches beyond the considerations of one person or one planet, with purpose when time and distance have next to no meaning. The Marvel output bucks and protests under these conditions. The company’s plot-driven blockbusters are overwhelmingly concerned with the present, and to an arguably greater extent, what’s next. Eternals considers where we are, where we’ve been, and how much it’s changed us, if at all. These are largely internal ideas that are not easily translated to superhuman brawls in dim environs, where the beauty of the natural world is just a blank canvas for lasers and punching. Every fight is like a tether pulling Eternals back to the ground when it would rather fly. Each scene expounding on the cosmology of the MCU does more for movies we haven’t seen yet than it does for the one we’re watching. Movies can be big enough for ideas like this: difficult conversations of cosmic import with no clear answer, angry confrontations with an uncaring god, and whether or not our moral compass should shift as our perspective and reach grows. But a film must create a world where those questions matter, to its characters and to its audience. In a few short lines, Zhao did that with Nomadland . Eternals , however, just isn’t big enough. Or perhaps the Marvel Cinematic Universe is just too small. Eternals premieres in theaters on Friday, Nov. 5.",,polygon,[],0.0,0.3,1.0

The report couched Facebook’s plan to extend its use of e2e encryption as “controversial” — aligning the newspaper’s choice of editorial spin with long-running UK government pressure on tech giants not to expand their use of strong encryption in order that platforms can be ordered to decrypt and hand over message content data on request. In its interview with Haugen, the Telegraph sought to link her very public concerns about Facebook’s overall lack of accountability to this UK government anti-e2ee agenda — claiming she had suggested Facebook’s use of e2e encryption could disrupt efforts to protect Uighur dissidents from Chinese state efforts to inject their devices with malware. The reported remarks were quickly seized upon by certain corners of the Internet (and at least one other ex-Facebook staffer who actually worked on adding e2e encryption to Messenger and is now self-styling as a ‘whistleblower’) — with concerns flying that her comments could be used to undermine e2e encryption generally and, therefore, the safety of scores of Internet users. Sounding unimpressed with the Telegraph’s spin, Haugen told UK lawmakers that her views on e2e encryption had been “misrepresented” — saying she fully supports “e2e open source encryption software”; and, indeed, that she uses it herself on a daily basis. What she said she had actually been querying was whether Facebook’s claim to be implementing e2e encryption can be trusted, given the tech giant does not allow for full external inspection of its code as is the case with fully open source e2ee alternatives. This is another reason why public oversight of the tech giant is essential, Haugen told the joint committee of the UK parliament which is scrutinizing (controversial) draft online safety legislation. “I want to be very, very clear. I was mischaracterised in the Telegraph yesterday on my opinions around end-to-end encryption,” she said. “I am a strong supporter of access to open source end to end encryption software. “I support access to end-to-end encryption and I use open source end-to-end encryption every day. My social support network is currently on an open source end-to-end encryption service.” “Part of why I am such an advocate for open source software in this case is that if you’re an activist, if you’re someone who has a sensitive need, a journalist, a whistleblower — my primary form of social software is an open source, end-to-end encryption chat platform,” she also said, without naming exactly which platform she uses for her own e2ee messaging (Signal seems likely — a not-for-profit rival to Facebook-owned WhatsApp which has benefited from millions of dollars of investment from WhatsApp founder Brian Action, another former Fb staffer turned critic; so maybe ‘meta’ would in fact be a perfect new brand name for Facebook). “But part of why that open source part is so important is you can see the code, anyone can go and look at it — and for the top open source end-to-end encryption platform those are some of the only ways you’re allowed to do chat in say the defence department in the US. “Facebook’s plan for end-to-end encryption — I think — is concerning because we have no idea what they’re doing to do. We don’t know what it means, we don’t if people’s privacy is actually protected. It’s super nuanced and it’s also a different context. On the open source end-to-end encryption product that I like to use there is no directory where you can find 14 year olds, there is no directory where you can go and find the Uighur community in Bangkok. On Facebook it is trivially easy to access vulnerable populations and there are national state actors that are doing this. “So I want to be clear, I am not against end-to-end encryption in Messenger but I do believe the public has a right to know what does that even mean? Are they really going to produce end-to-end encryption? Because if they say they’re doing end-to-end encryption and they don’t really do that people’s lives are in danger. And I personally don’t trust Facebook currently to tell the truth… I am concerned about them misconstruing the product that they’ve built — and they need regulatory oversight for that.” In additional remarks to the committee she further summarized her position by saying: “I am concerned on one side that the constellation of factors related to Facebook makes it even more necessary for public oversight of how they do encryption there — that’s things like access to the directory, those amplification settings. But the second one is just about security. If people think they’re using an end-to-end encryption product and Facebook’s interpretation of that is different than what, say, an open source product would do — because an open source product we can all look at it and make sure that what is says on the label is in the can. “But if Facebook claims they’ve built an end-to-end encryption thing and there’s really vulnerabilities people’s lives are on the line — and that’s what I’m concerned about. We need public oversight of anything Facebook does around end-to-end encryption because they are making people feel safe when they might be in danger.” Haugen, a former Facebook staffer from the civic integrity team, is the source for a tsunami of recent stories about Facebook’s business after she leaked thousands of pages of internal documents and research reports to the media, initially providing information to the Wall Street Journal, which published a slew of stories last month, including about the toxicity of Instagram for teens (aka the ‘Facebook Files‘), and subsequently releasing the data to a number of media outlets which have followed up with reports today on what they’re calling the Facebook Papers. The tl;dr of all these stories is Facebook prioritizes growth of its business over product safety — leading to a slew of harms that can affect individuals, other businesses and the public/society more generally whether as a result of inadequate AI systems that cannot properly identify and remove hate speech (leading to situations where its platform can whip up ethnic violence), or which allow engagement based ranking systems to routinely amplify extreme, radicalizing content without proper mind to risks (such as forming conspiracy-theory touting echo chambers forming around vulnerable individuals, isolating them from wider society), or overestimation of its ad reach leading to advertisers being systematically overcharged for its adtech. Internal Facebook documents highlight its moderation and misinformation issues During her testimony today, Haugen suggested Facebook’s AIs were unlikely to even be able to properly distinguish dialectal distinctions and nuances of meaning between UK English and US English — let alone the scores of languages in countries where it directs far less resource. Parliamentarians probed her on myriad harms during around 2.5 hours of testimony — and some of her answers repeated earlier testimony she gave to lawmakers in the US. Many of the UK committee’s questions asked for her view on what might be effective regulatory measures to close the accountability gap — both on Facebook and social media more generally — as MPs sought to identify profitable avenues for amending draft online safety legislation. “The danger with Facebook is not individuals saying bad things, it is about the systems of amplification that disproportionately give people saying extreme polarising things the largest megaphone in the room,” argued Haugen. Her list of suggestions for fixing a system of what she couched as broken incentives under Facebook’s current leadership included mandatory risk assessments — which she warned need to cover both product safety and organisational structure since she said much of the blame for Facebook’s problems lies with its “flat” organizational structure and a leadership team that rewards (and thus incentivizes) growth above all else, leaving no one internally who’s accountable for improving safety metrics. Such risk assessments would need to be carefully overseen by regulators to avoid Facebook using its customary tactic in the face of critical scrutiny of just marking its own homework — or “dancing with data” as she put it. Risk assessments should also involve the regulator “gathering from the community and saying are there other things that we should be concerned about”, she said, not just letting tech giants like Facebook define blinkered parameters for uselessly partial oversight — suggesting “a tandem approach like that that requires companies to articulate their solutions”. “I think that’s a flexible approach; I think that might work for quite a long time. But it has to be mandatory and there have to be certain quality bars because if Facebook can phone in it I guarantee you they’ll phone it in,” she also told the committee. Another recommendation Haugen had was for mandatory moderation of Facebook Groups when they exceed a certain number of users. Whereas — left unmoderated — she said groups can be easily misappropriated and/or misused (using techniques like ‘virality-hacking’) to act as an “amplification point” for spreading discord or disseminate disinformation, including by foreign information operations. “I strongly recommend that above a certain sized group they should be required to provide their own moderators and moderate every post,” she said. “This would naturally — in a content-agnostic way — regulate the impact of those large groups. Because if that group is actually valuable enough they will have no trouble recruiting volunteers.” Haugen also suggested that Facebook should be forced to make a firehose of information available to external researchers (as Twitter, for example, already does) — in a privacy-safe way — which would allow outside academics and experts to drive accountability from the outside by investigating potential issues and identifying concerns freed from Facebook’s internal growth-focused lens. Another of her recommendations was for regulators to demand segmented analysis from Facebook — so that oversight bodies get full transparency into populations that disproportionately experience harms on its platform. “The median experience on Facebook is a pretty good experience — the real danger is that 20% of the population has a horrible experience or an experience that is dangerous,” she suggested. She went on to argue that many of Facebook’s problems result from the sub-set of users who she said get “hyper exposed” to toxicity or to abuse — as a consequence of an engagement-driven design and growth-focused mindset that rejects even small tweaks to inject friction/reduce virality (and which she suggested would only mean Facebook giving up “small slivers” of growth in the short term and yield a much more pleasant and probably more profitable product over the longer term). “As we look at the harms of Facebook we need to think about these things as system problems — like the idea that these systems are designed products, these are intentional choices and that it’s often difficult to see the forest for the trees. That Facebook is a system of incentives, it’s full of good, kind, conscientious people who are working with bad incentives. And that there are lack of incentives inside the company to raise issues about flaws in the system and there’s lots of rewards for amplifying and making things grow more,” she told the committee. “So I think there is a big challenge of Facebook’s management philosophy is that they can just pick good metrics and then let people run free. And so they have found themselves in a trap where in a world like that how do you propose changing the metric? It’s very very hard because 1,000 people might have directed their labor for six months trying to move that metric and changing the metric will disrupt all of that work. “I don’t think any of it was intentional — I don’t think they set out to go down this path. And that’s why we need regulation — mandatory regulation, mandatory actions — to help pull them away from that spiral that they’re caught in.” Legislation that seeks to rein in online harms by applying regulations to platform giants like Facebook must also not focus only on individual harms — but needs to respond to societal harms, she also emphasized. “I think it is a grave danger to democracy and societies around the world to omit societal harm. A core part of why I came forward was I looked at the consequences of choices Facebook was making and I looked at things like the global south and I believe situations like Ethiopia are just part of the opening chapters of a novel that’s going to be horrific to read. We have to care about societal harm — not just for the global south but for our own societies. “When an oil spill happens it doesn’t make it harder for us to regulate oil companies. But right now Facebook is closing the door on us being able to act — we have a slight window of time to regain people-control over AI; we have to take advantage of this moment.” Facebook has been contacted for comment.

However, the NASA Starlight program points a path forward to send small, relativistic spacecraft far outside our solar system via standoff directed-energy propulsion. These miniaturized spacecraft are capable of robotic exploration but can also transport seeds and organisms, marking a profound change in our ability to both characterize and expand the reach of known life. Here we explore the biological and technological challenges of interstellar space biology, focusing on radiation-tolerant microorganisms capable of cryptobiosis. Additionally, we discuss planetary protection concerns and other ethical considerations of sending life to the stars. Directed Energy Propulsion of a Light Sail. (a) A light sail and payload propelled into interstellar space by directed energy laser propulsion. Emitted photons from a standoff laser array on the surface of the Earth (space-based laser arrays are also possible) impart momentum on the sail by reflection so as to accelerate the spacecraft up to relativistic speeds. Artist's rendition. (b) The laser array is composed of many small, modular sub-elements which can be articulated, switched off, and added so as to enable a large mission space. As the capability of directed energy propulsion grows, relativistic flight will become possible. Stephen Lantin, Sophie Mendell, Ghassan Akkad, Alexander N.

But how do earthquakes occur, and when have been the strongest ones recorded? GettyEarthquakes are caused by plate movements in the earth’s crust[/caption] What causes earthquakes? The earth’s crust is made up of different pieces known as tectonic plates. These plates fit together like a jigsaw and continuously move at a rate of a few centimetres a year, in different directions and at different speeds. It’s common for plates to slides past each other, bump into each other and move away from each other. As plates carry on moving in different directions over long periods of time, friction causes energy to build up. Eventually it becomes so great that the energy is released, which creates a shock wave – an earthquake. If the earthquake is beneath the ocean it can create a series of huge waves, called a tsunami.

Others can be powerful enough to damage and destroy towns and cities. The size of such earthquakes would be measured on the Richter magnitude scale. There are earthquakes in the UK, but they are rare and so small that most people do not feel them. What have been the strongest ever earthquakes? 5. Kamchatka, Russia Earthquake (1952) On November 4, 1952, at 16:58 GMT (04:58 local time) a huge earthquake struck off the coast of Kamchatka Peninsula, in the far east of Russia. Measuring 9.0 on the Richter scale, it produced a great destructive Pacific-wide tsunami with waves up to 15 meters – causing extensive damage to the Kamchatka Peninsula and the Kuril Islands. The earthquake approximately left 10,000-15,000 people dead. 4. Tōhoku Earthquake (2011) On March 11, 2011, at 14:46 GMT (05:46 local time), a massive undersea earthquake off the coast of Japan occurred. The 9.1 earthquake triggered a tsunami – producing waves up to 40.5 meters high. The waves traveled inland as far as 6 miles and caused extensive and severe structural damage in north-eastern Japan.  On March 10, 2015, it was announced that the confirmed casualties were 15,894 deaths, 6,152 injured, and 2,562 people missing. 3. Sumatra Earthquake (2004) GettyElephants pull debris January 6, 2005 to clear an area destroyed by the tsunami in Indonesia[/caption] On Boxing Day 2004, one of the deadliest natural disasters in recent history occurred. The 2004 Sumatra Earthquake, also known as the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, ruptured off the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia. It created the greatest fault length of any recorded earthquake – spanning a distance of 1500km, had the longest duration of faulting ever observed – between 8.3 and 10 minutes, and produced a tsunami with waves 30m high. It caused the entire planet to vibrate as much as 1cm and caused up to a quarter of a million deaths. 2. Great Alaska Earthquake (1964) The Great Alaska earthquake was the most powerful recorded earthquake in US history The 1964 Great Alaska earthquake, also known as Good Friday earthquake, occurred at 17:36 local time (01:36 GMT the following day) on Good Friday, March 27 in the Prince William Sound region of Alaska. It lasted approximately 4.5 minutes and is the most powerful recorded earthquake in US history. The 9.2 earthquake triggered tsunamis felt in Alaska, Oregon and California. A total of 139 people are believed to have died – 15 as a result of the earthquake itself. 1. Valdivia Earthquake (1960) GettyThe earthquake in Chile in 1960 was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded[/caption] Also known as the Great Chilean earthquake, it was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded measuring 9.5 on the Richter scale. The earthquake hit on May 22, at 19:11 GMT (15:11 local time), approximately 100 miles off the coast of Chile – parallel to the city of Valdivia.  It lasted approximately 10 minutes and triggered a massive tsunami with waves up to 25m.

Internal Facebook documents highlight its moderation and misinformation issues,https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/internal-facebook-documents-highlight-its-moderation-and-misinformation-issues/,"['Column', 'Social', 'TC', 'Facebook', 'tceng']",['Darrell Etherington'],,"The Facebook Papers, a vast trove of documents supplied by a whistleblower to news organizations has been released, and paints a picture of a company that repeatedly sought to prioritize profit.","Daniel Cooper Contributor Daniel Cooper is a senior editor at Engadget. More posts by this contributor Withings puts its heart-monitoring ScanWatch in the body of a diver’s watch Oh hey, Xiaomi has its own creepy robot dog now The Facebook Papers, a vast trove of documents supplied by whistleblower Frances Haugen to a consortium of news organizations has been released. The reporting, by Reuters, Bloomberg, The Washington Post and others, paints a picture of a company that repeatedly sought to prioritize dominance and profit over user safety. This was, however, despite a large number of employees warning that the company’s focus on engagement put users at risk of real-world violence. The Washington Post, for instance, claims that while Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg played down reports that the site amplified hate speech in testimony to Congress, he was aware that the problem was far broader than publicly declared. Internal documents seen by the Post claim that the social network had removed less than five percent of hate speech, and that executives — including Zuckerberg — were well aware that Facebook was polarizing people. The claims have already been rebutted by Facebook, which says that the documents have been misrepresented. Zuckerberg is also accused of squashing a plan to run a Spanish-language voter-registration drive in the US before the 2020 elections. He said that the plan may have appeared “partisan,” with WhatsApp staffers subsequently offering a watered-down version partnering with outside agencies. The CEO was also reportedly behind the decision not to clamp down on COVID-19 misinformation in the early stages of the pandemic as there may be a “material tradeoff with MSI [Meaningful Social Interaction — an internal Facebook metric] impact.” Facebook has refuted the claim, saying that the documents have been mischaracterized. Reuters reported that Facebook has serially neglected a number of developing nations, allowing hate speech and extremism to flourish. That includes not hiring enough staffers who can speak the local language, appreciate the cultural context and otherwise effectively moderate. The result is that the company has unjustified faith in its automatic moderation systems which are ineffective in non-English speaking countries. Again, Facebook has refuted the accusation that it is neglecting its users in those territories. One specific region that is singled out for concern is Myanmar, where Facebook has been held responsible for amplifying local tensions. A 2020 document suggests that the company’s automatic moderation system could not flag problematic terms in (local language) Burmese. (It should be noted that, two years previously, Facebook’s failure to properly act to prevent civil unrest in Myanmar was highlighted in a report from Business for Social Responsibility.) Similarly, Facebook reportedly did not have the tools in place to detect hate speech in the Ethiopian languages of Oromo or Amharic. Facebook has said that it is working to expand its content moderation team and, in the last two years, has recruited Oromo, Amharic and Burmese speakers (as well as a number of other languages). The New York Times, reports that Facebook’s internal research was well-aware that the Like and Share functions — core elements of how the platform work — had accelerated the spread of hate speech. A document, titled What Is Collateral Damage, says that Facebook’s failure to remedy these issues will see the company “actively (if not necessarily consciously) promoting these types of activities.” Facebook says that, again, these statements are based on incorrect premises, and that it would be illogical for the company to try and actively harm its users. Bloomberg, meanwhile, has focused on the supposed collapse in Facebook’s engagement metrics. Young people, a key target market for advertisers, are spending less time on Facebook’s platform, with fewer teens opting to sign up. At the same time, the number of users may be artificially inflated in these age groups, with users choosing to create multiple accounts — “Finstas” — to separate their online personas to cater to different groups. Haugen alleges that Facebook “has misrepresented core metrics to investors and advertisers,” and that duplicate accounts are leading to “extensive fraud” against advertisers. Facebook says that it already notifies advertisers of the risk that purchases will reach duplicate accounts in its Help Center, and lists the issue in its SEC filings. Over the weekend, Axios reported that Facebook’s Sir Nick Clegg warned that the site should expect “more bad headlines” in the coming weeks. Between the material available in the Facebook Papers, another round of Frances Haugen’s testimony in the UK later today and rumors of more whistleblowers coming forward, it’s likely that Facebook will remain in the headlines for some time.

Smart doorbells: how to use them without being fined for infringing a neighbour's privacy,https://theconversation.com/smart-doorbells-how-to-use-them-without-being-fined-for-infringing-a-neighbours-privacy-170180,,"['Andrew Charlesworth', ' Professor of Law', ' Innovation and Society', ' University of Bristol']",,,"RossHelen/ShutterstockAs any local solicitor can tell you, some of the most bitter legal disputes originate from disagreements between neighbours. Whether it’s property boundaries, loud music or parking spaces, what might initially be minor irritations can gradually lead to a full-blown court battle. A relatively recent development in neighbour conflicts are clashes centred on home surveillance products, such as CCTV cameras and smart doorbells. These technologies, which may capture footage beyond the householder’s property, can pit householders against neighbours who feel their homes and private lives are being unfairly spied upon. Indeed, a UK judge recently ruled that a man’s home security system invaded his neighbour’s privacy, and he now faces a fine of up to £100,000. So what are the privacy implications of this technology, and what do people need to know if they have, or are considering installing, a smart doorbell? Read more: Zao's deepfake face-swapping app shows uploading your photos is riskier than ever The use of surveillance technologies is governed by a range of measures. Some provide advice and guidance, like the surveillance camera code of practice, which sets out principles for operators to follow. Others are legal requirements, such as the rules for collection and processing of personal data under the Data Protection Act 2018 and the UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). These measures aim to ensure that any use of surveillance technologies is for legitimate purposes, proportionate, and compliant with relevant legal obligations. A key concern is that surveillance should, as far as possible, be with the informed consent of those surveilled. Where do smart doorbells fit in? Purely “domestic use” of personal data by a private individual is exempted from the data protection legislation – for example your list of addresses for sending Christmas cards. But it’s well established that home surveillance systems, including CCTV and smart doorbells, are subject to UK data protection legislation. A key case in 2014 looked at the use of a home CCTV system by a Mr Ryneš in the Czech Republic. The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) held that while Ryneš’ CCTV system was installed for a legitimate purpose – the protection of his property and personal security – the data collection went beyond that permitted solely for domestic use. This is because it collected personal data from a public space, including a footpath and the entrance to his neighbour’s house opposite. With this ruling, the CJEU confirmed that domestic surveillance systems fall within the scope of the data protection legislation where they capture data beyond the boundaries of the homeowner’s property. This interpretation remains applicable under UK law for now, although the UK government could potentially alter the scope of the “domestic exemption” now that the UK has left the EU. Smart doorbells notify the homeowner via an app when someone is outside their property. siamionau pavel/Shutterstock While this case and others that have followed since didn’t involve smart doorbells specifically, the principle is the same. The case of Fairhurst vs Woodard in the English County Court in October 2021 reinforces the view that the courts are likely to take a dim view of those who fail to use home surveillance equipment in a way that respects the rights of other people, including their neighbours. Woodard installed a range of surveillance technology, including CCTV cameras and a smart doorbell, for home security purposes. But these could record video and audio well beyond the boundaries of his property. He then actively misled his neighbour, Fairhurst, as to how and when the cameras operated. The court found Woodard to have breached his data protection obligation to process data in a lawful and transparent way, and to have collected personal data without a specified or lawful purpose, as required by the Data Protection Act 2018 and the GDPR. Read more: What does GDPR mean for me? An explainer The court did recognise that home security could be a legitimate purpose for collection of data that would otherwise breach a neighbour’s right to privacy, if the collection was reasonable and proportionate for that purpose. For example, in relation to Woodard’s Amazon Ring doorbell, the court held that capture of incidental personal data (such as video of Fairhurst walking past) was permissible. However, the capture of audio at a significant distance exceeded what was reasonable for the purposes, as did the fact the system’s viewing range recorded large areas of Fairhurst’s property, including her side gate, garden and parking space. It’s worth noting that Woodard’s use of his home surveillance system, and his interaction with Fairhurst concerning that use, also led to a successful action for harassment against him. Some tips If you’re considering installing a home surveillance system, such as a smart doorbell, you should: identify a clear and justified purpose for your use of CCTV, such as home security; when purchasing a system, consider the scope of data it can capture, whether this is reasonable for your intended purpose, and if the system can be tailored to protect other people’s privacy rights. For example, with some systems it’s possible to disable audio, and to set “privacy” zones which are not recorded; ensure there is signage stating recording is taking place, and why; keep all data collected secure and accessible only to those who need it, and delete it when no longer needed; comply with requirements of the Data Protection Act 2018 and the GDPR, such as responding to requests from individuals about data you may hold on them, and deleting data if requested to do so. The Information Commissioner’s Office has also produced some helpful advice for people installing home CCTV systems. Pleasingly, providers are becoming more aware of the risks and requirements of home surveillance technologies and are building in new features which may encourage lawful use. For example, Amazon has recently added end-to-end encryption to its smart doorbell technologies. This aims to keep personal data captured secure against misuse by third parties by restricting access to video and audio streams to specified devices and permitted users.

Read More",2021-10-24 10:00:05,"Article content It took all of about a half a day into my long-term test of the Outlander PHEV to understand why it is the country’s top-selling plug-in hybrid. Now that I’ve had a couple of weeks using the all-wheel-drive SUV for all manner of things on all manner of roads, my appreciation for it has only grown. Article content Sure, there are a few niggling things that I discovered over time — the seemingly random placement of drive mode buttons, the absence of a built-in NAV system — but in terms of being a comfortable, practical and, if managed properly, downright frugal compact crossover, the Outlander PHEV passes with flying colours. And with an all-in price under $50,000 for my tester, before rebates at that, it’s a very strong value for money proposition too. As to those rebates, there is the $2,500 federal one, and provincial ones in B.C. ($1,500), Quebec ($4,000), New Brunswick ($2,500), Nova Scotia ($2,500) and PEI ($2,500). We apologize, but this video has failed to load. Try refreshing your browser, or tap here to see other videos from our team . Long-term test introduction: 2022 Outlander PHEV Black Edition Back to video This model is the last of its generation, with an all-new plug-in Outlander coming next year as a 2023 model, promising more power and more all-electric range. It will also, no doubt, come with a new body style, one most likely similar to its fourth-gen, gas-powered stablemate. Increased engine output and range are most welcome; however, I’m not convinced the ‘new’ look — including somewhat demonstrative headlights — is an improvement over the current PHEV’s sleek and smooth exterior.

Photo by Andrew McCredie Sport and Snow driving modes were added this year to the PHEV's standard list.

You may use a different browser or device to view this in full screen. OK That improvement to the power output of the Outlander PHEV continues what has been a steady march in that direction, as the 2021 model received a bigger engine — a 2.4-litre in place of the 2.0-litre — larger battery capacity — from 12 kWh to 13.8 kWh — and upgraded electric motors over the previous plug-in. That’s the same powertrain that is in my tester, with that four-cylinder putting out 126 horsepower and 149 lbs.-ft of torque. Dial in that electric power, however, and the combined power output is 221 hp, or 31 hp over the previous powertrain. And the electric range bumped up from 35 km to 39 km (but on that note, my first couple of weeks have seen a higher all-electric range. More on that in the second instalment of this long-term test drive in a couple of weeks). Article content Also new for 2021 are Sport and Snow driving modes integrated into Mitsubishi’s tried-and-true Super All-Wheel Control (S-AWC) all-wheel drive system. To engage these modes you simply press the Twin-Motor 4WD LOCK button to simulate locking of a centre differential and optimally distribute torque to all four wheels to maximize traction. What makes the Outlander PHEV stand out among most of its plug-in peers is the ability to use Fast Charging to juice up the battery pack, which takes about 25 minutes to replenish up to 80 per cent power. Other charging methods include using a standard outlet at home with a supplied charging cable, through brake regeneration, and through ‘Charge Mode’ which uses the gasoline engine to charge the battery (I’ll also report more on this latter system in the next instalment). Article content The low deck makes loading and unloading for a road trip easy, and despite being billed as a compact crossover, rear cargo space is SUV-like. Photo by Andrew McCredie What I’ve come to appreciate about the Outlander PHEV is that there is a lot going on with that powertrain, depending on which drive mode you are in, how you drive when in EV mode, and even how you use the five-level regen braking paddle shifters on the steering wheel. And the full-charge range has gone as high as 91 km, which I’m still trying to figure out. For all of that, I’m glad to have this vehicle longer than the typical week we get to test a new car out. However, my two weeks so far have revealed a few things about the Outlander PHEV. Most notably, how little gas I’ve used during my daily commute and errands. I’ve plugged it in every night in my car port, and by morning have a full charge. The rare occasions when I’ve gone further than 50 kilometres are the only times the gas engine has fired up. I made it from my home in North Vancouver to the Vancouver airport and back on electricity only — a round trip of 58 kilometres — with more than handful of clicks on the clock. I also did some off-road travel in the Outlander PHEV along some logging roads near Squamish, and the all-wheel-drive system performed as advertised — my only complaint being the gas-engined power output was not ideal for climbing up some of the steeper sections. However, the vehicle’s low centre of gravity — greatly aided by the battery pack — kept it pinned and stable to the ground, and provided a fairly high level of 4×4 confidence. Article content The official maximum electric range of the Outlander PHEV is just over 50 kilometres, but that changes depending on your driving style and driving conditions. Photo by Andrew McCredie In the coming weeks I hope to fill it up with passengers for some urban exploring, take my dog for some mountain hikes and dive deeper into the inner workers of that mysterious gas-electric powertrain. One final thing: on three occasions now I have been approached by Outlander PHEV owners in parking lots and on side streets asking me all kinds of questions. How long have I owned it? Did I have the previous generation model before this one? What’s the highest I’ve got the all-electric range to on the gauge? How much range do I think the next gen will have? Passionate is an understatement in describing their appreciation for the model, and to me that is a ringing endorsement of this vehicle. Needless to say, I’m looking forward to the next few weeks testing it out more.",,driving,[],0.3,0.0,0.9

[+] Hayle, Cornwall, England, Wednesday, June 9, 2021. The sculpture, created by British artist Joe Rush ad sculptor Alex Wreckage, named Mount Recyclemore, aims to highlight the growing threat of e-waste. (AP Photo/Jon Super) ASSOCIATED PRESS According to the United Nations Global e-waste monitor, global e-waste volumes grew 21% between 2104 and 2019. in 2019, worldwide, there are more than 53.6 million tons of discarded e-waste. Based on this data, the report predicts that global e-waste will reach 74 megatons by 2030, doubling waste tonnage in 16 years, making e-waste the world's fastest-growing domestic waste stream. Jessica Klodnicki, Skullcandy CMO and head of the brand's sustainability task force says the consumer electronics industry has not educated consumers on the implications of their products' impact or given guidance on how to dispose of products at the end of life properly. Klodnicki says that because Skullcandy's target consumer is predominantly Millennial and Gen Z, the company started to know them better. “It was clear that they expect brands to solve significant issues facing the world, including climate change.” ""Sustainability in e-commerce often focuses just on production and logistics, but what comes after a product's lifecycle is being neglected,"" said Klodnicki. ""Once the product is with the customer, it's none of our business, right? Wrong. Businesses and consumers need to evolve and adapt circular economy programs to take recycling a step further."" Skullcandy's upcycle program was started in 2019 with a portion of proceeds from upcycled sales going to advance the causes championed by Protect Our Winters (POW), a climate advocacy organization. Three years later, the company has committed to keeping one million pounds of e-waste from landfills around the world by the close of 2025. MORE FOR YOU Google Issues Warning For 2 Billion Chrome Users Forget The MacBook Pro, Apple Has Bigger Plans Google Discounts Pixel 6, Nest & Pixel Buds In Limited-Time Sale Event “Consumers generate around 40 million tons of electronic waste every year worldwide, and only 12.5% of e-waste is recycled,” says Klodnicki. “This means the remainder of products is being discarded in landfills or sent to incinerators, which release harmful toxins into the air,"" Klodnicki said it was intimidating for the brand to acknowledge they were a small player contributing to the issue. ""We felt it was important to take ownership and action on the matter. We started the program in the US and Canada, partnering with a well-respected facility to handle the upcycling and proper recycling process,"" said Klodnicki. ""We took our learnings and expanded the program into Europe and the UK. Fast forward to 2021; we began doing extensive research around carbon offsets and becoming carbon neutral."" Klodnicki says Skullcandy is aware that this is an important, yet controversial subject. ""The research we found was complicated and often not congruent, but we felt and still feel that it is important for the company to work towards being carbon neutral as soon as possible,"" said Klodnicki. ""We chose to look at something we could effect immediately and set a large-scale goal around, which was withholding one million pounds of e-waste from landfills,"" said Klodnicki. ""We have the tools to track our impact (or lack of) and now have the information to further educate our retailers to partner with us in keeping products out of landfills,"" added Klodnicki. Since the launch of the Skullcandy circular commerce program, 439,216 units of product have been upcycled or recycled, which Klodnicki says equates to 458,450 pounds or close to 10,000,000 AA batteries of returned products withheld from landfills globally. ""Our new Grind Fuel and Push Active True Wireless Earbuds tackles this issue head-on by allowing over-the-air updates to consumers' earbuds, so consumers don't have to completely replace the hardware just because a new feature is available,"" added Klodnicki. By the close of 2021, Skullcandy says it also plans to have packaging exclusively utilize 100% recyclable packaging. And, by the end of 2023, the company will shift away from plastic to solely using FSC certified paper products. Klodnicki says the company hopes that more consumer electronics brands will recognize the severity of e-waste in landfills worldwide and prioritize being proactive versus reactive to the problem. ""We are being transparent about the initiatives and goals we have in place while also following our climate change partner's mission of progress over perfection,"" adds Klodnicki. In partnership with Carbon Checkout, Skullcandy launched a Carbon Checkout program on four of their global websites that encourage customers to offset their footprint on digital orders at the time of purchase. Klodnicki says that offsets in North America go towards a landfill gas capture project in Virginia, and international offsets fund a wind farm project in Bulgaria. But carbon offsets are not without controversy. In June 2021, Bloomberg reported on the dilemma of trying to decide what offsets should be traded and who can buy them. Shopify committed to investing at least $1 million each year into carbon sequestration ; Etsy announced in 2019 that it would pay for high-quality carbon offsets for consumers using its site. But Klodnicki says that since the launch of their program in August 2021, customers have already offset their purchase nearly 1,700 times. ""This means that Skullcandy's Carbon Checkout program hits above the industry standard, having achieved 11% redemption thus far.""",https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/0x0/filters%3Aformat%28jpg%29/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/617594e099d2aad2a31bf699/0x0.jpg,forbes,"[('Skullcandy', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY')]",0.4,0.0,0.9

The deal, which will push the car rental giant’s EV offerings to 20% of its global fleet, is reportedly worth $4.2 billion, according to sources cited by Bloomberg. Tesla Model 3 vehicles will show up in the Hertz rental as early as next month in major U.S. markets and select cities in Europe, according to the rental company. The order will likely represent a notable portion of Teslas manufactured and delivered over the next 14 months. The EV maker delivered 499,550 vehicles in 2020, with the vast majority of these being its most popular Model 3 sedan. Production and deliveries have risen this year. Tesla delivered 627,572 through the first three quarters of 2021. The company produced around 624,582 vehicles in that same 9-month time period. Hertz also announced plans to install thousands of chargers throughout its network to support the increase in EVs, in addition to a “premium and differentiated rental experience” for customers renting a Tesla that includes educating drivers on how to use and charge the car. Customers who rent a Tesla Model 3 will also have access to Tesla’s supercharging stations, infrastructure that is already under pressure in some locations as sales of the Tesla EVs skyrocket. Tesla shares rose more than 5% following the news, pushing the stock price to $960 shortly after the market opened. Hertz stock also saw an 11% increase, to around $27. Like other companies in the travel and tourism industry, Hertz had a rocky pandemic, with decreased rentals pushing the company to file for bankruptcy protection in May last year. The deal with Tesla comes just four months after Hertz emerged from bankruptcy, amidst a remarkable rebound for the rental car industry. Investment firms Knighthead Capital Management and Certares Management took over Hertz earlier this year.",2021-10-25 14:36:03,,,techcrunch,"[('Hertz', 'HEALTH ORG'), ('Hertz', 'INSURANCE COMPANY NAME')]",1.0,0.0,0.0

And no, Telesto did not cause it. I don’t think. I’m pretty sure. So, I was tagged roughly a zillion times yesterday regarding a video that had gone online about an extremely weird glitch that seemed to give players the ability to generate a ridiculous amount of orbs in PvP using the Titan bubble or Warlock well supers. The warnings here, I will give you up front. At best, Bungie is aware of this exploit/glitch and is tracking who is using it using a specific error code it may server them. At worst, this is something that could potentially get you banned, and there are reports of players being banned for using it. It’s called the Min/Max glitch, and involves putting the game into Windowed Mode, then hovering over the maximize button for five seconds. Pop the super and then it’s orb city. The weird thing is, this has been in the game for a long time. People have told me that this glitch was discovered some time this summer around July, and was already passed along to Bungie. What appears to have happened is that Bungie has been working on fixing this bug, which is supposed to be “nasty,” ever since, but they haven’t been able to crack it. So right now the temporary fix is hitting people with these RUTABEGA errors. There is no outright confirmation from Bungie that they are banning people who use it, and yet they can definitely track who is, and I wouldn’t rule it out. What’s happened now is that this player, JB3, published the glitch, so now Bungie had to comment on it publicly. Here’s what DMG had to say about it yesterday, responding to the original poster (who has reportedly been banned a few times for using/showing off things like this): MORE FOR YOU ‘Demon Slayer’ Season 2 Finally Has An Actual 2021 Release Date Netflix’s ‘Squid Game’ Season 2 Not A Sure Thing, Says Director ‘Genshin Impact’ Still Refuses To Increase Anniversary Rewards, Despite Fan Outcry So, the result of this glitch is nuts, it’s true. Instant supers for days. But if you use it, you are putting yourself at risk as Bungie is both extremely aware it exists and can track who is using it. You could just get the usual penalties repeated error codes give you, but push too hard, and I would not rule out a potential ban. So I would just avoid it completely. This has made Telesto bugs look tame, so let’s just stick with those, shall we? Telesto bolts now drop Bright Dust? That sounds like a nice, pleasant one. Someone work on figuring that out.

Where’s the mystery here? Huawei watches are usually announced before they head to stores, but the Huawei Watch Fit Mini seems to have skipped that part. The watch is available from Amazon Germany for 99 Euro, roughly $115 in a direct conversion. However, there’s no word of a US release at present. At first glance the Huawei Watch Fit Mini seems like a narrower version of the Watch Fit. It’s only 25.9mm wide, and has a 1.47-inch AMOLED screen of 196 x 368 pixels. The Huawei Watch Fit Mini lacks GPS, though, so will not be as effective a run tracker as its bigger sister. There is also no mentioned of Connected GPS, where the watch takes location information from a connected phone, although other affordable Huawei watches do support this. Neat as the Huawei Watch Fit Mini looks, its positioning is somewhat awkward. The Huawei Watch Fit now tends to sell at well below its original price, making the mini appear less of a good deal that it might otherwise. It has an aluminium front casing, with plastic on the back, and sells with either a brown, purple or white strap. There’s a heart rate sensor on the rear, and 5ATM water resistance means you can wear a Huawei Watch Fit Mini while showering or swimming.

From unjustified terminations to losing benefits with no warning, the employees inside the warehouse and the ones administering the leaves found themselves on the brink of burnout and sacrificing their lives to make up for countless HR issues related to paid and unpaid leave. Employees struggled to reach case managers, and doctor’s notes seem to simply disappear as paychecks were docked. To add to the dysfunction, Amazon’s team didn’t have any policies to accommodate local laws like one in its home state. An employee filing for unpaid leave under a Washington state legal protection of domestic violence victims was terminated from the company for missing deadlines. The Washington state attorney general that took on her case called her termination a “failure” and retaliation that violated state law, according to the NYT.

Facebook is spending at least $10 billion this year on its metaverse division,https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745381/facebook-reality-labs-10-billion-metaverse,,['Jacob Kastrenakes'],,,"Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge Facebook plans to spend at least $10 billion this year on Facebook Reality Labs, its metaverse division tasked with creating AR and VR hardware, software, and content. “We are committed to bringing this long-term vision to life and we expect to increase our investments for the next several years,” the company writes in its third-quarter earnings release this afternoon. Facebook sees AR and VR as being core to “the next generation of online social experiences.” A sign that Reality Labs should be judged separately from Facebook’s core apps The division, which already makes the Oculus Quest headset and Portal lineup of calling devices, is clearly being positioned as the next big thing inside of Facebook. For one, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been talking about the metaverse nonstop for the past several months. And today, Facebook said it’s going to begin reporting earnings specifically for its Reality Labs segment, while Facebook’s main ads business — a staggering $28 billion this last quarter alone — will be reported under another bucket. It’s a sign to investors that the Reality Labs business matters and should be judged separately from how they value Facebook today. It’s also a move to, perhaps, distract from what else is going on in Facebook’s earnings today. The company missed revenue expectations by around $1 billion (this is not a lot, exactly, at Facebook’s scale), which speaks to some of the company’s struggles right now. Facebook blames a number of factors for this: COVID-19, the economy, and Apple’s recent ad-tracking changes — something we saw last week when Snap reported earnings, too. Apple updated iOS in April with a new privacy feature that requires users to actively opt in to allow apps to track them across other apps and websites. Initially, social media companies said they weren’t certain how much it would impact their ads businesses, which rely on that tracking in part to measure the efficacy of ads. It’s been a rough few weeks for Facebook. A series of stories in The Wall Street Journal detailed significant missteps by the company, including moderation issues and concerns about younger users’ mental health; the whistleblower who leaked those documents then testified before Congress; and just this morning, dozens of stories were published by a consortium of news outlets, including The Verge, covering even more problems for Facebook, including worries about declining usage among teens. Also, in the middle of all of that, Facebook’s apps were all down for a good chunk of a day in early October. None of that is mentioned in Facebook’s earnings release today. But it is the context behind these investments and changes. If the Facebook brand and apps are going to come with this kind of baggage, the company would like to push toward something new where, just maybe, it can escape all that.",2021-10-25 21:06:10,,,theverge,"[('struggles', 'MEDICAL ISSUE')]",0.2,0.5,0.7

This would indicate that something passed in front of the light source, and if there is a regular period to the dips in the light seen from the star and the dip is of same magnitude, then you can confirm that there is a planet in orbit around that star. The exoplanet candidate spotted in M51 was seen in the same way, only instead of using visible light as with our current transit method for stars nearer to us, this method used X-ray emissions instead. The X-ray emissions are coming from either a neutron star or a black hole orbiting a larger star in a binary system. The companion star is estimated to have about 20 times the mass of the sun and is feeding the accretion disk around its partner, which is emitting the X-rays that the astronomers were able to observe. During their observation, they saw the X-ray emissions stop entirely for about 3 hours, which – along with other data – could indicate a Saturn-sized planet transiting in front of X-ray source at a distance of about twice Saturn's distance from the sun. This was only the first diminution of X-rays spotted though, so its too soon to say whether this is a planet or not – and confirmation could take decades. The researchers calculated that the planet's orbital period would be about 70 years, based on its size and distance. ""Unfortunately to confirm that we're seeing a planet we would likely have to wait decades to see another transit,"" said Nia Imara, of the University of California at Santa Cruz and co-author of the study. ""And because of the uncertainties about how long it takes to orbit, we wouldn't know exactly when to look."" While exciting in itself, this new method of detecting planetary transits in binary systems offers another method for spotting exoplanets here in our own galaxy. Since the X-ray emitting region of an accretion disk in these systems is small, a planet could completely block the X-ray source entirely, which is a much clearer indicator of a transit than measuring often subtle changes in the luminosity of a star. It should also be said that the planets spotted using this method would also have suffered through some pretty turbulent times. The collapse of a star into a neutron star or black hole isn't the most peaceful of transitions, and the the supernova that created them would have blasted the planet with some extreme radiation levels that would almost certainly stripped it of any life that might have been living on it. Then there's also the matter of the other star in the system. It hasn't gone supernova yet, but the steady loss of its material to its companion means that its demise is accelerating, so it would only be a matter of time before it too went supernova, blasting the planet again. Life in these systems is highly unlikely to say the least. Still, the X-ray transit method could prove useful in growing our catalog of planets outside our solar system.",,techradar,"[('Messier', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY'), ('href=""https://chandra.si.edu/', 'MEDICAL ISSUE'), ('/article', 'MEDICINE')]",0.0,0.0,1.0

Facebook says it’s refocusing company on ‘serving young adults’,https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745622/facebook-young-adults-refocusing-teams,,['Jacob Kastrenakes'],,,"Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says he’s redirected teams within his company to “make serving young adults their north star.” The comment, made on a call with investors this afternoon, speaks to Facebooks’ concerns about declining usage among teens and young adults. “So much of our services have gotten dialed to be the best for the most people who use them, rather than specifically for young adults,” Zuckerberg said. TikTok is “one of the most effective competitors we’ve ever faced” He suggested the change will be more than just lip service. Facebook usage among older users will grow slower than it otherwise would have because of the changes, Zuckerberg said. Even with those tradeoffs, he said, “I think it’s the right approach.” Zuckerberg expects the changes to take years. One of the more immediate shifts could be to Instagram, which he says will see “significant changes” to lean further into video and make Reels “a more central part of the experience.” The shift toward video is very clearly a response to TikTok, which Zuckerberg called “one of the most effective competitors we’ve ever faced.” While the details are largely talk for now, it’s clear that Facebook has been thinking and planning this before now. The Verge reported today on leaked Facebook documents showing the company’s alarm at seeing declining usage, with a precipitous drop predicted in the years ahead. The documents also show ideas Facebook considered to increase usage among younger users, including revamped groups, job finding tools, and “mood feeds.”",2021-10-25 21:58:49,,,theverge,[],0.2,0.6,0.4

Breakthrough Listen Releases Analysis of Previously Detected Signal From Nearby Proxima Centauri,http://astrobiology.com/2021/10/breakthrough-listen-releases-analysis-of-previously-detected-signal-from-nearby-proxima-centauri.html,,['Keith Cowing'],,,An intriguing candidate signal picked up last year by the Breakthrough Listen project has been subjected to intensive analysis that suggests it is unlikely to originate from the Proxima Centauri system.,2021-10-25 15:13:47,"An intriguing candidate signal picked up last year by the Breakthrough Listen project has been subjected to intensive analysis that suggests it is unlikely to originate from the Proxima Centauri system. Instead, it appears to be an artifact of Earth-based interference from human technologies, the Breakthrough Initiatives announced today. Two research papers, published in Nature Astronomy, discuss both the detection of the candidate signal and an advanced data analysis process that can finely discern ""false positives."" ""The significance of this result is that the search for civilizations beyond our planet is now a mature, rigorous field of experimental science,"" said Yuri Milner, founder of Breakthrough Inititatives. Breakthrough Listen (a program of the Breakthrough Initiatives) is an astronomical science program searching for technosignatures - signs of technology that may have been developed by extraterrestrial intelligence. Listen's science team, led by Dr. Andrew Siemion at the University of California, Berkeley, uses some of the largest radio telescopes in the world, equipped with the most capable digital processing systems, to capture data across broad swaths of the radio spectrum in the direction of a wide range of celestial targets. The search is challenging because Earth is awash with radio signals from human technology - cell phones, radar, satellites, TV transmitters, and so on. Searching for a faint signal from a distant star is akin to picking out a needle in a vast digital haystack - and one that is changing constantly over time. BLC1 - Breakthrough Listen's First ""Signal of Interest"" - Data and other related material The CSIRO Parkes Telescope in New South Wales, Australia (one of the largest telescopes in the Southern Hemisphere, known as 'Murriyang' in Wiradjuri) is among the facilities participating in Breakthrough Listen's search. One of the targets being monitored by Parkes is Proxima Centauri, the Sun's nearest neighboring star, at a distance of just over 4 light years. The star is a red dwarf orbited by two known exoplanets. The Listen team scanned the target across a frequency range of 700 MHz to 4 GHz, with a resolution of 3.81 Hz - in other words, performing the equivalent of tuning to over 800 million radio channels at a time, with exquisite detection sensitivity. Shane Smith, an undergraduate researcher working with Listen Project Scientist Dr. Danny Price in the summer 2020 Breakthrough Listen internship program, ran the data from these observations through Breakthrough Listen's search pipeline. He detected over 4 million ""hits"" - frequency ranges that had signs of radio emission. This is actually quite typical for Listen's observations; the vast majority of these hits make up the haystack of emissions from human technology. As with all of Listen's observations, the pipeline filters out signals which look like they are unlikely to be coming from a transmitter at a large distance from Earth, according to two main criteria: · Firstly, is the signal steadily changing in frequency with time? A transmitter on a distant planet would be expected to be in motion with respect to the telescope, leading to a Doppler drift akin to the change in pitch of an ambulance siren as it moves relative to an observer. Rejecting hits with no such signs of motion reduces the number of hits from 4 million to around 1 million for this particular dataset. · Secondly, for the hits that remain, do they appear to be coming from the direction of the target? To determine this, the telescope points in the direction of Proxima Centauri, and then points away, repeating this ""ON - OFF"" pattern several times. Local interfering sources are expected to affect both ON and OFF observations, whereas a candidate technosignature should appear only in the ON observations. Even after both of these data filters are applied, a handful of candidates remain that must be inspected visually. Sometimes a faint signal is actually visible in the OFF observations but is not quite strong enough to be picked up by automated algorithms. Sometimes similar signals appear in neighboring observations, indicative of interfering sources that may be turning on and off at just the wrong period, or the team can track down the signals to satellites that commonly broadcast in certain frequency bands. Occasionally an intriguing signal remains and must be subjected to further checks. Such a signal-of-interest was discovered by Smith in Listen's observations of Proxima Centauri using the Parkes telescope. A narrow-band, Doppler-drifting signal, persisting over five hours of observations, that appears to be present only in ""ON'' observations of the target star and not in the interspersed ""OFF"" observations, had some of the characteristics expected from a technosignature candidate. Dr. Sofia Sheikh, currently a postdoctoral researcher with the Listen team at UC Berkeley, dug into a larger dataset of observations taken at other times. She found around 60 signals that share many characteristics of the candidate, but are also seen in their respective OFF observations. ""We can therefore confidently say that these other signals are local to the telescope and human-generated,"" says Sheikh. ""The signals are spaced at regular frequency intervals in the data, and these intervals appear to correspond to multiples of frequencies used by oscillators that are commonly used in various electronic devices. Taken together, this evidence suggests that the signal is interference from human technology, although we were unable to identify its specific source. The original signal found by Shane Smith is not obviously detected when the telescope is pointed away from Proxima Centauri - but given a haystack of millions of signals, the most likely explanation is still that it is a transmission from human technology that happens to be 'weird' in just the right way to fool our filters."" Executive Director of the Breakthrough Initiatives Dr. S. Pete Worden remarked, ""While we were unable to conclude a genuine technosignature, we are increasingly confident that we have the necessary tools to detect and validate such signatures if they exist."" Breakthrough Listen is making all of the data from the Parkes scans available to the public to examine for themselves. The team has also just published two papers (led by Smith and Sheikh) outlining the details of the data acquisition and analysis, and a research note describing follow-up observations of Proxima Centauri conducted with the Parkes Telescope in April 2021. Listen will continue monitoring of Proxima Centauri, which remains a compelling target for technosignature searches, using a suite of telescopes around the world. And the team continues to refine algorithms to improve their ability to discriminate between ""needles"" and ""hay"", including as part of a recently-completed crowdsourced data processing competition in collaboration with kaggle.com. ""In the case of this particular candidate,"" remarks Siemion, ""our analysis suggests that it's highly unlikely that it is really from a transmitter out at Proxima Centauri. However, this is undoubtedly one of the most intriguing signals we've seen to date.""

Thanks for joining us. I’m Mike Le Couteur. Mercedes Stephenson is away today. Well many of the federal pandemic relief programs that helped millions of Canadians pay their bills have come to an end. Since the pandemic isn’t over, starting today there are new programs in place to help Canadian workers and businesses that continue to be affected by COVID-19. The new benefits target the hardest hit sectors and will be around until May of 2022. Chrystia Freeland, Deputy Prime Minister : “Our support needs to be more narrow, more targeted and less expensive.” Mike Le Couteur : The hardest hit sectors: tourism and hospitality will get the most help. A special recovery program will be in place for businesses, like restaurants and hotels, for the next month with plans to introduce legislation that will extend it until next May. The Tourism and Hospitality Recovery Program will provide wage and rent subsidies to businesses with a sustained 40 per cent revenue decline over the past year. Other businesses not in those sectors can apply for a similar program with a sliding scale. These other businesses would quality if they have sustained revenue loss of at least 50 per cent, with a subsidy starting at 10 per cent. Business groups were happy with the extension of the benefits, but say the devil really is in those details. Story continues below advertisement Dan Kelly, Canadian Federation of Independent Business, Toronto : “The bar is too high and the subsidy too low to make a big difference for many businesses that are hanging on by their fingernails.” Mike Le Couteur : As of March 13 th , 2022, the subsidy rates for the rest of the programs will be cut in half. The Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit and the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit will remain. The new Worker Lockdown Benefit will replace CRB. It’s for workers whose jobs are affected by a public health lockdown and will give employees $300 a week if they aren’t already collecting EI. And joining me right now is the Minister of Employment Carla Qualtrough. Minister, thanks for being here. A lot of these benefits are now much more targeted, but at the same time your government will be leaving behind thousands of Canadians who were depending on the CRB to pay their bills. What do you say to them? Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Employment : Thanks Mike, for having me. You know the reality is the economic and public health circumstances have changed from when we put in the CRB, since September of 2020. So we understand with the job numbers where they are, with the unemployment rate where it is, where job vacancies are, that we really needed to move to a move targeted approach that really focus on the sectors that haven’t recovered and to support workers when they’re in a situation of lockdown. We know that these were always intended to be temporary measures, and I would just say, you know, it’s where we are in the evolution of this pandemic and it’s actually a reflection of how we’ve succeeded economically in recovering. Mike Le Couteur : Now part of it, and another one of the programs, is the Canada Recovery Hiring Program. It’s being extended. Subsidy is also being bolstered a little bit to 50 per cent, but we’re still hearing from businesses who are telling us anyways that they’re having trouble filling—finding workers to fill those jobs. So is that program really achieving what it was set out to achieve? Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Employment : Really important question. We’ve been hearing a lot from businesses about the labour shortages they’ve been experiencing. These labour shortages were there before the pandemic and we’re really trying to put in place active measures like the hiring program, the wage subsidy that incentivize work and aren’t as passive, say, as the CRB was, which was appropriate at the time, but we think we’ve moved on. Mike Le Couteur : And when you say you think you’ve moved on, I mean do you really think that if they’re having trouble finding these workers that it’s really setting out what it needs to do, or do you think more needs to happen there? Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Employment : Well I think it’s a combination of a bunch of things. So absolutely, the hiring program is one tool we have. We have got—we’re investing significantly in training where we’re encouraging businesses to use the wage subsidy. The hiring program is underutilized and I think that’s a matter of us getting the message out that if you want to give people more hours, if you want to hire more people, if you want to increase the salary of the people you have on your staff, that’s all eligible under the hiring program. So I spent a lot of time putting that message out in my own community because I think businesses don’t necessarily understand the breadth of the—the scope of the criteria for this program. Mike Le Couteur : Now one of the issues that employers could be facing also is the mandatory vaccinations for certain workers, for certain jobs. If an employee does make the decision not to get vaccinated but it’s required for their job, do they or don’t they qualify for Employment Insurance? Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Employment : Again, important question. So if an employer has a clear policy with clear consequences and it’s well understood that non-compliance, so this condition of employment could lead to dismissal, if they are dismissed, they typically would not be able to access EI for these reasons because of course, a fundamental principle of the EI program is that claimants have to lose their employment through no fault of their own. And this would be seen typically as a choice. Now of course, every case is a case by case basis, certainly not the minister’s purview at all to arbitrate these things. But as a matter of course, typically they would not be eligible. Mike Le Couteur : So how concerned are you when you hear already that lawyers are warning that you could see a great number of challenges here and, you know, what are you basing the grounds on what you’re saying right now, your assertion that they couldn’t collect EI, if you are having a lot of lawyers saying that there could be these challenges and that it could possibly overrun the system with these challenges. Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Employment : Yeah. I mean certainly, I don’t weigh-in on the legality of this. But we’re confident that the Employment Insurance Act stating that—you know basically it says if a claimant, so an EI claimant is disqualified or disentitled form receiving benefits because they left their job, either they were fired or they dismissed—sorry, I shouldn’t say fired—as a result of their own misconduct, which in this case would be non-compliance within existing policy, there is grounds for not getting EI. But I—you know as with any new policy or circumstance, this is case by case. This will have to go through the courts or through the Social Security Tribunal and not my place to weigh-in on the merits of any one particular case. Mike Le Couteur : So help me try and understand this because we’re dealing with a labour shortage, yet as a government you’re saying that you’re comfortable with excluding all of these people and making sure that they also don’t get EI. So how do we sort of square that circle of we need workers, but as a government you’re comfortable with these people being excluded from certain jobs and not getting EI? Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Employment : Well you know effectively, Mike, we know that vaccines are the most effective tool against COVID-19, and we also don’t want people putting fellow employees or fellow workers at risk. We don’t want workplaces to have to shut down because of an outbreak in a workplace, and we announced the details of our mandatory vaccine policy for employees of the Public Service. We are encouraging other businesses to follow suit, and we just think it’s good public health policy but also economic policy to have safe, healthy workplaces and therefore, we want people to be vaccinated and right now, we’re still in the middle of this pandemic and we need people to be vaccinated. We need workers to be vaccinated, of course if they can be. Mike Le Couteur : Yeah. I want to switch gears for a quick second here. Last week, your government introduced the vaccine passport to be recognized hopefully by a number of other countries. So what countries is your government in consultation with right now to make sure that it’s recognized, especially when you consider that the land border with the U.S. or the softening of restrictions of the border with the U.S. is coming just at the beginning of November. A lot of Canadians are looking to try and travel, so have we started the discussions with the U.S. and what other countries will be recognizing our national passport? Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Employment : Well absolutely. First of all, having a standardized national proof of vaccination based on the Smart Health Canada standard is one way to bolster the credibility, the reliability and the acceptance of our, what we would call PVC, which is proof of vaccination credentials. We’ve been working over the past months with a number of international organizations to ensure that these credentials are recognized. We do the same for passports to make sure that countries recognize this. We expect that all countries that are currently accepting Canadian travellers will accept our PVCs, our proof of vaccination credentials, and, you know, all countries that are currently accepting travellers are accepting all forms of vaccine certification. But that work is ongoing and I think as the world, which really has a vested interest, and people moving around and visiting and getting back to whatever normal looks like, we’re all working together to make sure our citizens can safely travel between countries. Mike Le Couteur : On the vaccine passport specifically, how closely are we working with the U.S. and how soon can you say, or can we say, that they will recognize that vaccine passport? Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Employment : I don’t have a timeline for the last part of your question, but we’ve been working with the U.S. a long—you’re talking to an MP who has Point Roberts right as a neighbour and we’re working very closely with the U.S. on this issue. Mike Le Couteur : Okay. Minister Qualtrough, we’re going to have to leave it there. Thanks so much for joining us today. Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Employment : Thanks Mike, take care. Mike Le Couteur : Up next… Catherine McKenna, Former Liberal Cabinet Minister : “Well, it may be raining out, but I am so excited because I’m launching a new initiative at COP26. Stay tuned, it’s going to be awesome.” Mike Le Couteur : That’s former Liberal Cabinet Minister Catherine McKenna. We’ll ask her about life after politics, which includes the U.N. Climate Summit in Glasgow. [Break] Story continues below advertisement [Announcer] Mike Le Couteur : Former Liberal Cabinet Minister Catherine McKenna surprised many political watchers when she decided not to run again in the last election. And before she was infrastructure minister in the Trudeau government, McKenna was the minister of environment, leading Canada’s fight against climate change. She’s out of politics but still in the fight against climate change and now on a more global scale. McKenna is heading to the U.N. in New York this week before heading to Glasgow for COP26, that’s the U.N. Summit on Climate Change. And Catherine McKenna joins me right now. Thanks so much for joining us, and first question: You’ve left politics, but clearly you haven’t left this fight on climate change. Tell me why you think it can be more effective to fight climate change out of politics than inside the corridors of power? Catherine McKenna, Former Liberal Cabinet Minister : Well look, I think I was pretty clear when I decided to leave that it was to focus on my kids but also on the fight against climate change. And pollution doesn’t know any borders. We have a climate plan here in Canada. We need to always be doing more, but we’ve done things like put a price on pollution, phase out coal, make historic investments in sustainable infrastructure, and we need the world to do that and we need momentum going into COP26 and beyond. So that’s really what my focus is on. I will always be someone who sees climate change as the biggest issue and do whatever I can. Mike Le Couteur : On that, you gave a bit of a hint on Twitter in the last few days, last week, saying that you have a big initiative coming. Now it seems to me this would be a great opportunity for you to break this news on our show right now. So why not do that right now? Catherine McKenna, Former Liberal Cabinet Minister : Well Mike, I’m actually partnering with the United Nations and some other folks so I am not going to do that, but stay tuned and there will be an invitation to Canadians to participate because I think—I mean the initiative is intended to show yes COP is a moment in time, but people have been taking action on climate change before COP26 and when they tear it all down, people will continue to be taking action. So it’s going to be great. I’m really excited about it, but everyone’s just going to have to wait. We’re launching next Friday. Mike Le Couteur : You can’t fault me for trying I guess, eh? So looking ahead to COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, people are already lowering expectations, unfortunately. The reality is that countries are far off their targets right now, Canada included. So new reports are showing that Canada won’t hit its emission reduction targets, what happened when you were minister and since, that has allowed Canada to come up short? Catherine McKenna, Former Liberal Cabinet Minister : Well okay. So first of all, I think it’s really important to be clear that we haven’t missed our targets. The targets are a 2030 target so we’re pretty far away from 2030, and we’ve already shown the pathway to how we will meet what we set as an initial target in 2015, reducing emissions by 30 per cent. And the Paris Agreement requires you to ratchet up ambition, so to be more ambitious. So we announced, Jonathan Wilkinson, the prime minister announced that we would reduce emissions by 40 to 45 per cent, and we’re bringing in new initiatives all the time. And I think there’s some really important work that’s being done, including for the oil and gas sector. They have to be part of it. Emissions have to go down from that sector because they’re a very significant portion of Canada’s emissions. But we’re doing things like phasing out the internal combustion engine by 2035. Imagine, like no cars that will be sold in Canada will have any emissions associated with them. Massive retrofit programs, massive investments in public transit. But we all have to do the work. Look, I think COP 26—it’s going to be hard because we need to see the ambition. You’ve seen everyone call for it, including Greta. And it can’t just be talk, it has to be action. Canada has shown what we’re going to do and we know we need to do more, but every country needs to do that and bring it to the table that is the whole purpose of the Paris Agreement, everyone doing their part. Mike Le Couteur : To your point, you’ve always said that climate change is all about math, and it’s very simple for people to understand that. So how can Canada really be taken seriously in the climate change fight if we continue to extra oil and gas? Catherine McKenna, Former Liberal Cabinet Minister : Well first of all, it’s a transition and transitions aren’t linear and they’re not perfect. And so, you know, you can’t immediately wave a magic wand and say, you know we’re getting rid of oil and gas. People are use—we use oil and gas. Everyone is using oil and gas, but we do need to transition. We need to figure that out. And that’s exactly what we’re doing. Part of in this election, the Liberal platform was to tackle emissions from the oil and gas sector that is critically important. We phased out coal. We need the whole world to be phasing out coal. There are still countries like Australia have a lot of work to do. But we also need to figure out jobs and I’ve always felt this that you—the transition has to work for everyone, which means you’ve got to dig deep and you have to figure out how are people going to have good jobs while we do everything we need to do to tackle climate change. And let me be very clear: we know what we need to do. The goal is staying well below 2 degrees, striving for 1.5 degrees that was negotiated in the Paris Agreement, that’s the science. And so we’re going to have to do our part the same way every country in the world is going to have to transition as fast as possible, away from fossil fuels. So that’s coal, that’s oil and gas. Mike Le Couteur : So doing our part but at the same time, you mentioned Australia. There’s also, you know, the U.S. doesn’t have a price on pollution either. How do we use our influence as a country to try and lean on other countries to make sure that they’re coming to the plate with more ambition if we’re trying to bring more ambition? Catherine McKenna, Former Liberal Cabinet Minister : Well I think that’s a really important point, Mike. And I think, you know, sometimes people say well why is Canada doing this? Why have we committed to phasing out coal when, say, Australia hasn’t? Because you need to have credibility if you’re going to go, you know, tell other countries or encourage other countries or support other countries to doing the hard things we all need to do. And so putting a price on pollution, I’ve been slightly encouraged in the United States they’re having a really tough time getting their infrastructure bill passed, but now they’re thinking well maybe another way to get emission reductions would be a price on pollution. I’ve had many conversations with Americans, including Republicans, who support and market mechanisms to reduce emissions. But this is what I want to do, I mean my focus is how do we scale ambition on climate and how can we share Canada’s lessons? But just get real because you’re right, it is math. So, first of all, we need to get the whole world off coal as fast as possible. We also need to transition off of oil and gas, and that requires a lot of work, a lot of different solutions and ultimately, I’ve been working together. And that’s, you know, you can shame folks, but also you need to show the path because it’s not that easy and I think Canada’s got a great role to play going into this COP. We’re helping to find—we’ll secure $100 billion per year to support developing countries because they’ve done the least to cause climate change and they’re paying the price right now and we need to be supporting them. So, there’s a lot of pieces to this puzzle, but I think Canada’s got a great story and maybe even a better story because it’s hard for us, because we do produce oil and gas and we’ve—you know, coal. And so showing that we’re figuring it out and working really hard, I think is a really important lesson for other countries and a very practical way and as I say, that’s my thing: how do we scale climate solutions all around the world? Mike Le Couteur : I’ve only got a minute for this last question and it’s kind of a two-parter. So about that $100 billion for the developing nations, what happens if we don’t raise that much money? And what to you, does a successful COP26 actually look like? Catherine McKenna, Former Liberal Cabinet Minister : Well we have to raise that money. There will be no success in COP unless there’s $100 raised, so Canada’s got to dig deep. Germany’s digging deep. Next week—well sorry, this coming week I’m at the U.N. looking at how we raise the ambition. Germany is there. They’re the co-lead with Canada on raising the $100. I mean look, success ultimately would look like we’ve got a path to stay well below 2 degrees, striving for 1.5. I don’t think we’re going to get there, but the Paris Agreement, don’t lose hope. It requires countries to continuously raise the ambition and guess what? Every single day around the world, people are taking action on climate change. So COP, they’re going to fold things up and go home. People will go home, but people will still be acting and that’s what we need to do. We need to continue pushing as hard as we can, all of us digging deep. It’s not just about governments, it’s about individuals, it’s about businesses and we can do it. We tackled COVID, we’re on our way to getting out of COVID. It’s the same thing with climate. We can do it, but we’re going to have to really work extremely hard and be focused. Mike Le Couteur : Catherine McKenna, I appreciate you taking the time being with us. Unfortunately we’re going to have to leave it there. We’ll talk to you soon. Thanks again. Up next, who’s in and who’s out? There are some big questions heading into Tuesday’s cabinet shuffle. We’ll be joined by Global News’ Amanda Connolly to talk about how these appointments will outline key government priorities. Stay with us. Story continues below advertisement [Break] Mike Le Couteur : Justin Trudeau unveils his third cabinet as prime minister this week. The swearing in ceremony will take place on Tuesday at Rideau Hall with Canada’s first Indigenous Governor General Mary May Simon. Globalnews.ca political reporter Amanda Connolly is here to break it all down for us. Thanks for joining us, Amanda. Amanda Connolly, Global News Political Reporter : Thanks for having me. Mike Le Couteur : I guess the first question. It’s the elephant in the room. I mean there’s no way that Harjit Sajjan can remain as defence minister, right? Amanda Connolly, Global News Political Reporter : This really is the big thing that we’re watching for right now and again, this is—this has been a big problem for the government, their handling of the military sexual misconduct crisis. I spoke with one expert a couple of weeks ago saying this is effectively a sucking chest wound for the government. They just cannot seem to get it under control to really stem the damage flowing from this. And of course, we’re watching for that as we look to the cabinet shuffle next week. Mike Le Couteur : Yeah. And so without naming other names, I mean how much does the naming of the cabinet really sketch out the priorities that this government will have? Who goes where and especially when you consider child care, environment, those types of things. Amanda Connolly, Global News Political Reporter : I think that’s a really good question and again, as you mentioned there, child care. There are some really big items on the government agenda right now that they have to have people in those jobs who can actually get things done. I think first and foremost, though, you’re really looking at three things that are going to factor in here. You’ve got the geographic representation, people from all the different across the country. You’ve got the gender balance issue, too, second, which is a big thing for the government here. They have doubled down committing to that, so we’re going to watch for whether that increases the size of the cabinet here, too, and again, as you mentioned, actually getting things done. They’re looking for people here, again, with another election possibly 18 months away, that can jump into these files, get things done and not mess it up while doing it. Mike Le Couteur : And it’s interesting because there are some backbenchers, who have been doing well, either as parliamentary secretaries, or otherwise that have been really carrying the mail and in a sense, they’ve got to promote them as well, right? Amanda Connolly, Global News Political Reporter : Yeah. And again, this is, I imagine, a tricky issue for the government. You’ve got people who have been doing the backbench work, parliamentary secretary stuff now for a couple of years in this government and haven’t necessarily seen the promotions that maybe they feel they’re owed or that people might think they are owed. So you’ve got to imagine here, again, a difficult balance for the government looking at who to promote, who they’re going to have to keep relying on to go out there and do a lot of this work in terms of the TV interviews and shoring things up when there are problems for the government. Mike Le Couteur : And there’s one thing that I thought was always interesting. There’s—you know we sort of talk about it behind the scenes and say oh, this person for sure; they’re definitely going to get one. And sometimes they get passed over, either because of regional representation or for other reasons. How do you think that that’s going to affect caucus morale when there are going to be people who will be passed over and then, you know, they have to take up their role as a backbencher? Amanda Connolly, Global News Political Reporter : Well they’re in a really challenging position right now and that’s again, because we had this—we just had this election. They did not get the majority that a lot of people think they were looking for with that decision, right? So they obviously are going to have a limited timeframe here. They’re going to be looking to really make an impact and with that, you need your caucus to work together. You have to have that cohesion, that ability to get things done and to have that—that strong cohesive unity in the caucus itself to present a united front to Canadians. Mike Le Couteur : Because you can really upset some people if they get left off, again. Amanda Connolly, Global News Political Reporter : Absolutely. Mike Le Couteur : It’s just one of those interesting dynamics that thankfully you or I don’t have to do. We can just sit here and talk about it, right? Amanda Connolly, Global News Political Reporter : That’s the best part, right? Mike Le Couteur : Thanks so much for this, Amanda, really appreciate it. Well, that’s our show for today, everyone. Thanks so much for spending your time with us. Mercedes Stephenson will be back next Sunday. For The West Block, I’m Mike Le Couteur.

He made the call on Sunday shortly after being affirmed as the chairman of the party at the state Congress that was conducted amidst tight security at the outskirts of Jalingo metropolis. The Congress was observed to have taken place despite a court order restraining the party from performing the exercise which was earlier postponed following the pockets of skirmishes that erupted. The Congress, which was conducted via affirmation, was observed to have brought together all the party’s chieftains across the state. Speaking, the leader of the party in the state, Senator Yusuf S. Yusuf, said any other congress outside is illegal. Backing El-Sudi’s call for the aggrieved members of the party to put aside their differences and work for the collective interests of the party, he noted that the aggrieved members did not pass through the party’s normal procedures of resolving disputes before embarking on legal action. Optimistic that the party will form the next administration in the state come 2023, the need for those dragging the party backward to retreat their actions and join hands with the new leadership of the party in order to emerge victorious in the forthcoming polls, he believed can no longer be overemphasized. Also speaking, the Congress committee chairman, Alhaji Tijani Tussa, said before arriving at the affirmative method, all the key critical stakeholders of the party from the state have been engaged in a round table dialogue. Stressing that the exercise is not illegal as being perceived by some members of the party, the national body of the party, he said will work with the new party executive at the state level to catapult the party to the height. Also on her part, the Secretary of the state Congress, Dr. Rachael Akpabio, who went ahead to make the names of the party Executive of the state public via affirmation, said every part of the state and interests are well represented in the party Executive. Stressing that the “position of the party is very simple”, he urged the aggrieved members “to come back and work for the party.” Reiterating his desire to extend the much needed hands of friendships to the aggrieved members and to as well operate an open-door policy, the newly-elected chairman believed that with all hands on deck, the dreams of the PDP retaining power come next elections, would no doubt turn out to be a mirage. Aggrieved party chieftains who include the immediate past Minister of Power, Engineer Saleh Mamman; former acting governor of the state, Alhaji Sani Danladi Abubakar, to mention but just a few, were observed to have lucidly boycotted the exercise. 2023: Why northeast deserves to produce next president – Gimba We must work to usher in APC administration in Taraba – El-Sudi",2021-10-24 17:12:09,,,dailypost,"[('Jalingo metropolis.', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY')]",0.1,0.2,0.7

As well as providing more checks, tests and scans, and help get waiting lists down, £2.3billion of the funding package will be used to try to transform diagnostic services. The Treasury said there will be at least 100 “one-stop-shop” community diagnostic centres across England, including the 44 already announced. These centres are expected to help clear most existing test backlogs caused by the pandemic, including for CT, MRI and ultrasound scans, by the end of the parliament.

In a statement on Sunday, the Secretary of the NCOC, Governor Seyi Makinde, said the convention will take place regardless of the “distraction” posed by a case instituted at the High Court in Kaduna to prevent the event from being held. The case, which was launched by Uche Secondus, suspended chairman of the PDP, sought to stop the preparation for the convention, pending the hearing of his chairmanship case in the court of appeal. While playing down Secondus’ suit, Governor Makinde said the party is “aware of the actions of a few misguided PDP members who have approached the High Court in Kaduna in an attempt to prevent our great party, the PDP from holding its National Convention on October 30 and 31, 2021. “Notwithstanding their right to approach a court of competent jurisdiction to air their grievances, we maintain that the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the PDP has acted in good faith in fixing our convention for October 30 and 31. It is not meant to witch-hunt anyone or to truncate anyone’s mandate,” the statement added. “Therefore, we call on all members and supporters of the PDP to ignore this distraction as we prepare to host a convention that will send a clear signal to Nigerians that the PDP is the only party that has the will and the might to rescue Nigeria from the catastrophe that we have been enduring for the past six years. “We are aware that a clearly united PDP is a threat to the forces that seek to divide us. Therefore, we urge our teeming supporters nationwide to keep the faith as we are taking all necessary measures to ensure that we will not be distracted from our goal.” The governor further noted that the PDP is determined to strengthen its party structure and to put in the work needed to unify and restore the nation back on the path to economic prosperity and greatness.

In a statement on Sunday, the Secretary of the NCOC, Governor Seyi Makinde, said the convention will take place regardless of the “distraction” posed by a case instituted at the High Court in Kaduna to prevent the event from being held. The case, which was launched by Uche Secondus, suspended chairman of the PDP, sought to stop the preparation for the convention, pending the hearing of his chairmanship case in the court of appeal. While playing down Secondus’ suit, Governor Makinde said the party is “aware of the actions of a few misguided PDP members who have approached the High Court in Kaduna in an attempt to prevent our great party, the PDP from holding its National Convention on October 30 and 31, 2021. “Notwithstanding their right to approach a court of competent jurisdiction to air their grievances, we maintain that the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the PDP has acted in good faith in fixing our convention for October 30 and 31. It is not meant to witch-hunt anyone or to truncate anyone’s mandate,” the statement added. “Therefore, we call on all members and supporters of the PDP to ignore this distraction as we prepare to host a convention that will send a clear signal to Nigerians that the PDP is the only party that has the will and the might to rescue Nigeria from the catastrophe that we have been enduring for the past six years. “We are aware that a clearly united PDP is a threat to the forces that seek to divide us. Therefore, we urge our teeming supporters nationwide to keep the faith as we are taking all necessary measures to ensure that we will not be distracted from our goal.” The governor further noted that the PDP is determined to strengthen its party structure and to put in the work needed to unify and restore the nation back on the path to economic prosperity and greatness. On behalf of the PDP, Makinde urged all party faithful to continue to rally support even as the opposition political party prepares to host its National Convention.",,informationng,"[('PDP', 'MEDICAL ISSUE'), ('PDP', 'MEDICAL ISSUE'), ('PDP', 'MEDICAL ISSUE'), ('PDP', 'MEDICAL ISSUE')]",0.5,0.3,0.5

Susannah Goshko, the newly arrived British high commissioner to Canada, says the current Trudeau government has shown “huge leadership” on the international stage in the fight against climate change. Read more: Countries trying to downplay climate change actions ahead of COP26 summit: Greenpeace That’s because Canada has doubled its financial commitments to climate financing and raised its emissions-reductions targets, which is putting pressure on other countries, Goshko said. Goshko offered the assessment in a wide-ranging interview as the United Kingdom prepares to host what are seen as pivotal United Nations climate talks in Scotland next month, known as COP26. Story continues below advertisement Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faced criticism from his political opponents and from environmental groups during the recent federal election because Canada’s carbon emissions actually rose from 2015 to 2019, the most recent years for which data is available. While new Liberal policies might have driven down emissions in the two years since then, the current data has fuelled the narrative that Canada’s reputation on fighting climate change has been diminished since Trudeau’s 2015 participation in the Paris climate agreement in the weeks after he won power. Not so, in Britain’s view, said Goshko. “I think that there’s no question it’s hard to do what needs to be done to reach our climate goals. A transition to a net-zero economy is really, really tricky. And I think the important thing, as far as Canada is concerned, is the commitment is there,” said Goshko. 2:17 Report: Canada set to fall short on targets for carbon emissions Report: Canada set to fall short on targets for carbon emissions – Oct 6, 2021 Net zero is the term that means no new emissions would be added to Earth’s atmosphere, with nature or technology capturing any that are produced. Story continues below advertisement Canada pledged this year to reach net zero by 2050, and has also raised its emissions-reduction targets from 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, to 40 to 45 per cent. Those new commitments, as well as Canada’s partnership with Germany to help deliver US$100 billion in financing to poorer countries to help them fight climate change, mean that “Canada’s shown huge leadership,” Goshko said. Read more: Prince Charles warns leaders of climate crisis: ‘Dangerously narrow window’ “It’s the kind of leadership we need because we need all countries now to really be stepping up on those commitments if we’re to make COP a success.” Goshko said it’s crucial that China, as the world’s largest emitter, play a role in COP26 but her government is still waiting to find out whether President Xi Jinping will be joining the estimated 120 world leaders in taking part in the opening of the meeting in early November. Despite China’s voracious appetite for energy, including the coal-fired variety, Goshko said it is also the world’s largest investor in renewable energy, which makes it a valuable partner in fighting climate change. Goshko has had a front-row seat to Britain and Canada’s fraught engagement with China in recent years. She served two years as the principal private secretary to the recently departed British foreign minister Dominic Raab. Story continues below advertisement She witnessed first-hand the personal friendship that Raab and his former Canadian counterpart, Francois-Philippe Champagne, forged during in-person meetings in London before and after the onset of the pandemic. Raab was enthusiastic to pursue a deeper alliance with Canada especially given Britain’s departure from the European Union, said Goshko. 5:45 Calgary climate activist to attend COP26 Calgary climate activist to attend COP26 That manifested itself in supporting Canada in countering China’s imprisonment of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, which only ended in September after nearly three years. Raab was an early supporter of Canada’s international effort to create a declaration against arbitrary detention by states, she said. And Canada was an eager participant in international efforts to criticize China for human rights violations in Hong Kong and bring in sanctions over abuses in its Xinjiang province against Muslim Uyghurs, she said, undaunted by the fact China was holding two of its nationals in apparent retaliation for the arrest of Chinese executive Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. extradition warrant.

While Ontario’s provincial government continues its gradual re-opening of the economy, including most recently an announcement of full capacity for gyms and restaurants set for this Monday, Saiyan said business is still just a fraction of what it was prior to the pandemic. 4:38 Pandemic rent and wage subsidies coming to an end Pandemic rent and wage subsidies coming to an end Saiyan says the business is now just operating on little more than 30 per cent of the revenue it was earning pre-COVID, and that every “penny” and more that they’ve saved up in previous years has already gone forward to cover bills like rent, electricity and wages.

The new Tourism and Hospitality Recovery Program and Hardest Hit Business Recovery Program are set to come into effect Sunday, according to Freeland.

The CRB, which was formerly known as the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), will also be replaced by a more targeted program called the Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit (CWLB). While the new programs are said to be more targeted to those that need them the most, many are concerned that it won’t be enough to keep them and their businesses afloat. David Macdonald, a senior economist for the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, wrote that as many 1.5 million people could be directly impacted by the replacement of those programs — most of whom won’t have another source of income or support.

We have recovered lost jobs.” Small business owners have previously called on the federal government to not stop COVID-19 benefits ahead of their expiration — calling it a lifeline for their livelihoods. Rina Camarra, the manager of Mastro’s Restaurant in Toronto, told Global News in September that her business was on the wage subsidy program over the months-long pandemic. 5:33 Looming expiry of pandemic financial supports leaves small businesses wary Looming expiry of pandemic financial supports leaves small businesses wary “It’s not an easy task for us to run a business nowadays,” said Camarra.

Business minister Paul Scully said the Government is aware of the cost of “stop start” lockdowns and doesn’t want to “stifle” the recovery. Leaked papers drawn up officials at the Cabinet Office and Treasury predict Plan B would cost up to £3.6bn a month. Whitehall mandarins are working on the “assumption” new restrictions would stay in place until March next year. According to the documents, obtained by Politico, working from home would be cause the biggest hit to businesses.

Rylan Clark wakes after boozy birthday bash to find celeb pal still in his home Officials say telling people to stay away from offices would only have a moderately positive impact on cutting transmission. They also warn the PM vaccine passports would make a negligible difference to stopping the virus whilst having a “high impact” on the economy. The research says Covid papers would reduce overall transmission across the country by just 1-5 percent. That’s because though even they cut spread at mass events by 40-45 per cent, only 2-13% of new infections occur at such venues. And mandarins warn imposing vaccine passports could have “wider impacts” and further deepen the UK’s supply chain crisis. The paper says they are “likely to have a positive impact in reducing transmission, although it is not possible to say accurately by how much”. Officials said reimposing a full lockdown, which the PM insists he’s not considering, would have a much greater effect on squashing the virus. ‘No sense’ Plan B needed A Government spokesman said: “We knew the coming months would be challenging, which is why we set out our autumn and winter plan last month. “Plan B ensures we are ready, should we need to act, to avoid an unsustainable rise in hospitalisations which would put unsustainable pressure on the NHS. “The presumptions put forward do not reflect government policy. There is no planned five-month timeline.” Separate Whitehall research, seen by the Telegraph, calculates vaccine passports could cost the events sector up to £2.3bn over six months. It warns bringing them in would simply push people from larger, well ventilated venues like football stadiums into crowded pubs. Mr Scully insisted the PM still sees no plan to trigger Plan B as hospitalisations haven’t risen sharply in line with cases. He said: “We saw the concerns of businesses when we had the stop-start nature this time last year and we knew the cost to business of that. “That’s why we’re taking every measure to make sure we don’t choke down on the recovery, that we allow businesses to trade fully. “We don’t want to be stifling the recovery. So there’s no sense that there’s anything at the moment that’s suggesting Plan B is needed.” Most read in News GREAT FRIGHT Inside abandoned zoo with remains of great white SHARK floating in tank YEARS OF ABUSE Dad held knife to abused wife's throat before she killed him, says daughter PAY RISE £1,000 a year boost to wages as Rishi hikes minimum wage to £9.50 an hour 'WE'LL MISS YOU' Tributes to 'loved' teen boys after pair stabbed to death as 8 arrested JEALOUS RAGE Mum battered neighbour with bat & called girl 'ugly ginger ****' in lover row DRIVEN TO DESPAIR Frustrated driver tells eco-protester ‘I hope everyone you know gets cancer’ Covid cases across the UK dropped for the fourth day in a row yesterday and stood at 36,100.

That committee is preparing to hear from Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen during a meeting next month in Brussels, Belgium. The two Canadian MPs spoke with Global News Monday about what they are taking away from the revelations in the Facebook Papers. In short? The time to act is now, they say. “It is past time for stronger platform governance and it is past time for greater accountability,” said Liberal MP Nathaniel Erskine-Smith. “I think it’s a call to arms for public rules.” READ MORE: Facebook failed to stop global spread of abusive content, documents reveal On Monday morning, 17 American news organizations began publishing a series of articles that paint a damning portrait of Facebook’s internal operations with regards to how it manages and reviews content. Story continues below advertisement The articles are based on thousands of pages of internal company documents obtained by Haugen, a whistleblower who was formerly a product manager at the social media giant. EXPLAINED: What are the Facebook Papers? Haugen has testified before American and British regulators about how she says Facebook prioritizes profits over safety. She had said the company hides research assessing what role it plays in inciting political violence, and the records have prompted serious concerns about the extent to which its products hurt teenage users, particularly girls. Several of the media articles about the Facebook Papers cited records showing the social media giant’s employees have warned the company was failing to police abusive content, repeatedly being told it was causing harm, and that its algorithms were inciting political violence for years. 0:49 Angus says parliamentarians have ‘obligation’ to hold Facebook, other social media sites to account Angus says parliamentarians have ‘obligation’ to hold Facebook, other social media sites to account – Oct 18, 2021 Erskine-Smith said the revelations add to the urgency for government to regulate the algorithms used by social media companies seriously and force greater transparency on them.

READ MORE: Facebook whistleblower says platform amplifies online hate, extremism NDP MP Charlie Angus said the coming session of Parliament should be one where all parties work together to crack down on social media giants like Facebook in light of the information in Facebook Papers. “I think Canadians are expecting this Parliament to show maturity and work together,” Angus told Global News. “I think Big Tech would be an area where we could all work together.” “The Facebook papers reveal more about what we already know – that this is a massively powerful corporation that has consistently refused to take action to address the real-time harms that are happening on its platform,” he continued. “Mr. Trudeau must address this longstanding pattern of corporate negligence. This will include efforts to break up the Facebook monopoly, to institute rigorous oversight and to establish credible penalties, including criminal sanctions, for the corporate negligence at Facebook.” Erskine-Smith suggested discussions about breaking up Facebook would only be effective if done in partnership with American lawmakers. The International Grand Committee on Disinformation was first created in 2018.

The group, during a press conference on Sunday, advised the voters to evaluate all the candidates based on their pedigree either in private or public life to determine who can manage the tiny resources of the State for the betterment of all. Mr Lawrence Onuzulike, IPAN National President, who made the call at a press conference in Awka, charged the Anambra electorate to shine their eyes, as it was another privilege for them to reintegrate into the national polity. According to the group, the implementable manifestoes by the candidates should be evaluated to guild the voters while casting their votes to a managerial-drained candidate. “Anambra cannot afford to make the mistake of voting in someone who has no serious agenda for the people, who just want to be called governor but does not have a purposeful vision,” he said. Mr Onuzulike stressed that the Anambra election scheduled to hold on November 6 would offer a fresh opportunity to the people of the State to correct their previous mistakes. He named some challenges of the State to include, decayed education, health institutions, poor water facility and refuse disposal systems, saying the challenges were birthed by poor managerial skills directed to the sectors. The IPAN believes that time for a new beginning has come in Anambra to revamp the sectors believed to be poorly handled and said it is up to the voters to vote right. He said that voters should be able to elect a candidate that will be capable of seeing the Igbo at the centre to project timely the election of an Igbo person as president in 2023.

Downing Street is braced for more confrontation with President Emmanuel Macron as talks over licences for UK waters reach a crucial stage French skippers are threatening to blockade Calais from Saturday morning if negotiations on a fishing deal fail. Paris has set midnight on Friday as the deadline and is preparing reprisals, which may be triggered next Monday. It wants to slap extra import taxes on British goods but is unlikely to win the necessary backing from the EU. Instead, it could cause backlogs at Calais and Dover by ordering more physical checks. Other measures will include hiking electricity in Jersey and blocking UK boats from French ports. But French officials privately admit they do not want to make strained relations with Britain even worse. It comes as an EU row brews after Brexit minister Lord Frost dismissed its opening offer on Northern Ireland border checks.
