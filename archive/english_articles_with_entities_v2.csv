The post These Scalp Massagers Claim to Promote Hair Growth, so Sign Me and My Tresses up appeared first on Lifehacker Australia.","In the last year alone, you’ve probably noticed the haircare industry bringing out more treatments targeting your scalp health — exfoliating scalp scrubs, micellar shampoos, detox sprays, and now, scalp massager brushes. Scalp massagers do exactly what it sounds like — they’re a handheld, brush-like device that you can use to stimulate and exfoliate the scalp. You’ve probably noticed them starting to pop up online, which of course has piqued your interest and you’ve ended up here. But is using one actually better for your scalp health than a massage with your fingers? Short answer: yep, it can be! Healthy hair starts with your scalp, so if your scalp is littered with dead skin cells and product buildup, it makes it much harder for your hair to grow properly. Regularly using a scalp brush when you shampoo your hair helps to remove all the dead skin cells and product that’s accumulated between washes. The massaging motion alone is also said to help stimulate growth, as it promotes blood circulation in the hair follicle and can help to deliver more nutrients. So you really don’t have anything to lose by incorporating one into your routine. Plus, they feel so damn good! That said, if you’re someone who suffers from scalp irritation, dandruff or psoriasis, you might want to skip the scalp massage. Rubbing or scrubbing the scalp when it’s in that condition can further cause irritation, inflammation and swelling. Scalp brushes act more as a preventative in this instance than a treatment. Ahead, we’ve rounded up a range of affordable scalp massagers you can buy online and have delivered to your door. READ MORE What Are Scalp Scrubs and How Do You Use Them?

If you’ve ever had a good look up there in the bathroom mirror, you might be shocked at the amount of hair you have. Before you start hacking at it though, it’s important to know how to remove it safely. We’re here to share the four best nose hair removal methods you can do at home. READ MORE How to Clean Your Ears Safely at Home Without Cotton Tips Why do we have nose hair? Before you start the removal process, it’s important to know that your nose hair (while pesky) actually serves an important purpose for your health. It’s actually the first line of defence against bacteria and germs in the nasal cavity, so you don’t want to get rid of it all. More than that, it’s also part of the system that protects your lungs from dirt and debris that gets into the airways. If you didn’t have nose hair you’d be entirely vulnerable to all these things which opens you up to infections. So, if you do choose to manage the amount of nose hair for aesthetic purposes, it needs to be done properly and hygienically. How to get rid of nose hair at home Now that we’ve established the importance of nose hairs, we can chat about the safest methods of managing it at home. These are trimming, waxing, plucking and cutting (with specialised scissors). Manically pulling out the hair with tweezers is highly discouraged for a bunch of different reasons. First of all, it’s painful as hell but it’s also one of the less hygienic methods of removing hair. So put down the tweezers and try one of these four methods first. Best nose hair removal tools Now that we’ve told you explicitly what not to do, it’s time to focus on the tools that are actually safe to use at home. The good news is, you don’t have to be a professional and they’re really simple to operate and clean. Trimmers Philips Multigroom Series 7000 12-in-1, $109 This device is a best-seller for a reason – its versatility and affordability. Coming with 12 different heads, not only can you trim your nose hairs, but you can also shave your face, eyebrows, ears and anything else that needs some tidying up. Buy the Philips Multigroom Series 7000 12-in-1 ($109) from Amazon here. Panasonic ER430K Ear & Nose Trimmer, $35.08 The dual-edge blades on this trimmer make it easy to trim nose, ear and facial hair with precision. It’s fu waterproof so you can use it in the shower if you wish, and it has an advanced micro vacuum system to suck up trimmed hair particles into a chamber. Buy the Panasonic ER430K Ear & Nose Trimmer ($35.08) from Amazon here. Philips Series 3000 Ear, Eyebrow & Nose Trimmer, on sale for $24.95 (usually $29.95) The shape of this trimmer is specifically made to reach into your nose and earholes, making it a super easy trimmer option. It also has safeguards so you won’t hurt yourself if you make contact. Buy the Philips Series 3000 Ear, Eyebrow & Nose Trimmer ($24.95) from Amazon here. Plucking THE PLUCK Nose Hair Remover, $37.66 This looks like a torture device but it’s actually designed to be relatively pain-free. The beauty of this device is that it removes your nose hair at the root which diminishes its ability to grow back over time – so less plucking for you in the long run. Just pop the tip of the device into your nostril and pull down on the blue toggle to jerk the hairs out, then go forth and enjoy your hair-free nose. Buy THE PLUCK Nose Hair Remover ($37.66) from Amazon here. Scissors Nose Hair Trimming Scissors, $37.87 It might sound borderline insane to trim your nose hairs with scissors but it can actually be done (with the right tool). These scissors are a popular nose hair removal method as it’s not painful at all but still gives a very precise trim. Buy the Nose Hair Trimming Scissors ($37.87) from Amazon here. Waxing Nose Wax Kit, $19.99 This product isn’t for the faint-hearted, so if you’re looking for something relatively painless you might want to pass on this one. Essentially, you heat up the wax in the microwave before dipping the sticks in and inserting them into your nostrils. Give it around 90 seconds and then pull down as quickly as possible to rip the hairs right out. You’ll get the satisfaction of seeing all the hair once it’s removed but you may not be able to see it through the tears in your eyes. Buy the Nose Wax Kit ($19.99) from Amazon here. Nad’s Nose Wax Kit, $8.75 Same same, but a little cheaper and it’s formulated with chamomile and aloe extract to help your sensitive nose area as much as possible, considering you’re tipping all the hair out.

How to support a person with dementia as lockdowns ease,https://theconversation.com/how-to-support-a-person-with-dementia-as-lockdowns-ease-169462,,"['Lee-Fay Low', ' Professor in Ageing and Health', ' University of Sydney']",,,"ShutterstockLockdowns lasting months in some states have seen tight restrictions on visitors to nursing homes. So as lockdowns ease, and if you’re vaccinated, you might be planning a happy reunion with your friend or family. If your loved one has dementia, you might be wondering if their symptoms have worsened in lockdown, or if they remember who you are. Here’s what to look out for on your first visit after lockdowns end, and how to support your loved one after that. Read more: Why people with dementia don't all behave the same Expect some decline Lockdowns can result in decline in people with dementia, particularly those living in nursing homes. Research from lockdowns in 2020 showed people with dementia had more trouble thinking and problem solving. Their behaviour and mood worsened. Some studies showed people were less able to do things around the home or look after themselves. Keeping mentally, physically and socially active helps people with dementia maintain their brain and thinking. But in lockdown, when people with dementia did less, they exercised their brains and bodies less. Read more: How best to celebrate Christmas with a person with dementia Lockdowns not only meant a ban on visitors to nursing homes, but limited stimulation from group activities, such as concerts, visits from schools and bus outings. During lockdowns, nursing home residents (more than half have dementia) also got worse in terms of their thinking and well-being. Residents sometimes didn’t understand why they couldn’t move freely around the nursing home, and why their loved ones had stopped visiting. This led to increases in behaviours, such as agitation. After lockdowns began, there has been an increase in prescriptions of psychotropic medications reported internationally. These medications are used in nursing homes to manage behaviours such as aggression and agitation. The first visit can be difficult Some families might be worried about their first visit in several months to a person living with dementia. They might be concerned their loved one has gotten worse, or scared they won’t recognise them. But it may help to think of visits as providing really important mental stimulation and human connection for your loved one, even though visits might be difficult emotionally for you. Introduce yourself: “Hi Dad, it’s Ali”, if it looks like your loved one can’t quite place who you are or your name. Read their reactions to you. If they need time to warm up to you (which might be disappointing if you are close), chat with someone else who is there. The person might enjoy your company even if they aren’t actively participating in the conversation at first. Prepare an activity to do together, based on their interests. Shutterstock Then invite them to participate in the conversation by asking them their opinion: “How is the dog going?” or “I’m looking forward to going to the hairdresser, how about you?”. Prepare an activity to do together based on their interests. You could walk in the garden, browse a magazine about the royal family, sing along to a favourite album. If it’s a noisy gathering, find a quiet spot for one-on-one conversation, as the person may have trouble focusing when there are several people talking at once.

Let them know when you’ll be coming again. You can write this down in their calendar, or on a card to give them. You can also tell the nursing home staff so they can remind them. You can also leave a visual reminder of your visit. This could be a card or photograph, or some flowers with a note. If possible, get back into a visiting routine. You could leave some flowers and card as a physical reminder of your visit. Shutterstock If you notice a decline Families are more likely to notice small or marked changes in their loved one’s abilities if they have not seen them for several months. That might mean noticing early signs of dementia or worsening symptoms if they’ve already been diagnosed with it. So this can be a delicate conversation to have with your loved one. Many people can be defensive or in denial about changes, put it down to “old age”, and are afraid about having dementia. You might need to have the conversation several times to get them to see the doctor. Call the National Dementia Helpline on 1800 100 500 for advice.

So it’s worth looking into what support services your loved one might need. A psychologist can help with strategies to manage memory and thinking; an occupational therapist can help with doing day-to-day things around the house; an exercise physiologist or physiotherapist can help with mobility; and a speech pathologist can help with communication. Family carers can talk to their loved one’s dementia specialist, or ask their GP for a Chronic Disease Management Plan for some subsidised rehabilitation sessions. If you’re not the main carer If you’re not the main family carer, make sure that person has some support. Ask how they are feeling and what support you can offer. Carers have been providing more help during lockdowns to people with dementia living in the community. That’s because there have been fewer services on offer, and as people with dementia needed help to comply with restrictions. Offer to spend some time with the person with dementia so the carer can have a break. Or take the carer out for a meal and some social time now restrictions have eased.

The experts said it has become necessary to discourage cultures prohibiting the consumption of snails and okro by breastfeeding mothers, stressing that there is no scientific evidence to back the claim that the nutritious foods make babies drool saliva or cause other health issues. According to the experts, the nutritional value and composition of breast milk are regulated by the nutritional status of the mother. One of the experts, and a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Paediatrics, College of Medicine, University of Lagos, Dr. Beatrice Ezenwa, told PUNCH HealthWise in an exclusive interview that breastfeeding mothers need to eat a nutritious and well-balanced diet. Dr. Ezenwa who is also a Consultant Neonatologist/ Paediatrician with the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Idi-Araba said nursing mothers should eat in moderation and avoid what they noticed consistently do not agree with their babies or themselves. The neonatologist said, “In general, a breastfeeding mother can eat any food. No food is off-limit because a woman is breastfeeding. “The key point is to eat a balanced diet and eat in moderation. Having said that, each baby is different and may react differently to certain foods eaten by the mother which comes out in the breast milk in terms of nutrients and flavor. “Some babies can be very fussy and cranky when their mothers eat very spicy foods. Other babies become sleepy or have disorganised sleep patterns when their mothers consume too much of certain other foods such as alcohol and caffeine. “In some cultures in Nigeria, breastfeeding mothers are prohibited from eating certain nutritious foods such as snails, okro, etc because it will make the baby drool saliva. “Meanwhile others encourage the consumption of more harmful ones such as excessive alcohol intake like palm wine in the name of helping the breast milk to flow. These myths are unfounded and the practices are not good, so should be discouraged,” she added. On the myths about certain foods that mothers consume during breastfeeding that make their babies have constipation, the paediatrician said it is not common for exclusively breastfeeding infants to be constipated. Dr. Ezenwa explained, “Breast milk is considered a natural laxative because of the easily digestible nutrients it contains. “There are many other reasons a baby may be gassy that have nothing to do with the foods the mother has eaten. “Some people believe falsely that eating hot and spicy foods or acidic foods such as citrus fruit and tomatoes may cause ‘gassiness’ in babies, but these are not proven. “Unless you can see a direct relationship between specific foods and the same reaction in the baby every time, there is no need to limit your diet.” The child health expert further stated that it is untrue that consuming egusi soup, fruits, and vegetables during breastfeeding makes babies prone to stooling. According to her, this is not proven, saying, “I can safely say, it is not true.” She, however, said, “A breastfed baby may have an allergy or sensitivity reaction after the mother consumes certain foods or drinks (for example cow’s milk allergy, wheat, corn, eggs, nuts, and fish). “This does not mean that every baby whose mother consumed these foods will have diarrhoea. “People react differently to things. If a breastfeeding baby consistently has diarrhea each time a mother consumes a certain food he should be taken to a hospital for proper evaluation.” The neonatologist advised breastfeeding mothers to eat a well-balanced diet. “Eat in moderation and avoid what you notice consistently do not agree with your baby or yourself. “You also need to eat all types of food common in your culture or environment to help your child develop the taste bud for that food. “Some flavors infants are exposed to through breast milk can influence their food preferences as they grow up,” she said. Also speaking with our correspondent, Assistant Chief Dietician, Ajeromi General Hospital, Ajegunle, Lagos, Olusola Malomo, said, “Cultural beliefs and practices can markedly influence a woman’s pregnancy and childbirth experiences, and may shape a woman’s mothering behaviour. “Dietary intake before and during pregnancy and throughout the lactation period is often influenced by cultural beliefs and practices,” Malomo said. Speaking on some foods that are avoided by pregnant women on the ground of cultural beliefs, the dietician said, “In a recent scientific study, approximately 37 per cent of respondents avoided some foods in pregnancy due to food taboos. “Snail and grasscutter meat were the commonly avoided foods in pregnancy, while eggs were commonly withheld from children under two years old. “Some respondents believed that eating snail and grasscutter meat makes a child sluggish and labour difficult respectively; while some say that starting egg early for a child could predispose them to steal later in life.” Charting the way forward, the dietician called for women’s empowerment and education.

At least 243,270,300 cases of coronavirus have been registered. The vast majority have recovered, though some have continued to experience symptoms weeks or even months later. The figures are based on daily reports provided by health authorities in each country. They exclude revisions made by other statistical organisations, which show that the number of deaths is much higher. The World Health Organisation estimates that the pandemic’s overall toll could be two to three times higher than official records, due to the excess mortality that is directly and indirectly linked to COVID-19. A large number of the less severe or asymptomatic cases also remain undetected, despite intensified testing in many countries. On Saturday, 6,072 new deaths and 394,025 new cases were recorded worldwide. The countries with the highest figures for new deaths were Russia with 1,072, followed by the United States with 590 and India with 561.

(AFP) The post 6,072 new COVID-19 deaths, 394,025 fresh cases recorded globally appeared first on Healthwise.",2021-10-24 15:21:57,"The novel coronavirus has killed at least 4,941,032 people since the outbreak emerged in China in December 2019, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP at 1000 GMT on Sunday. At least 243,270,300 cases of coronavirus have been registered. The vast majority have recovered, though some have continued to experience symptoms weeks or even months later. The figures are based on daily reports provided by health authorities in each country. They exclude revisions made by other statistical organisations, which show that the number of deaths is much higher. The World Health Organisation estimates that the pandemic’s overall toll could be two to three times higher than official records, due to the excess mortality that is directly and indirectly linked to COVID-19. A large number of the less severe or asymptomatic cases also remain undetected, despite intensified testing in many countries. On Saturday, 6,072 new deaths and 394,025 new cases were recorded worldwide. The countries with the highest figures for new deaths were Russia with 1,072, followed by the United States with 590 and India with 561. The US is the worst-affected country with 735,801 deaths from 45,427,539 cases. After the US, the hardest-hit countries are Brazil with 605,457 deaths from 21,723,559 cases, India with 454,269 deaths from 34,175,468 cases, Mexico with 286,259 deaths from 3,781,661 cases, and Russia with 230,600 deaths from 8,241,643 cases. The country with the highest number of deaths compared to its population is Peru with 607 fatalities per 100,000 inhabitants, followed by Bosnia-Herzegovina with 345, North Macedonia 338, Bulgaria 331, Montenegro 328 and Hungary 316. Latin America and the Caribbean overall has 1,514,642 deaths from 45,718,783 cases, Europe 1,373,413 deaths from 72,449,471 infections, and Asia 862,678 deaths from 55,455,754 cases.

Quips about putting radio on the internet aside, the persistent popularity of podcasting and the cockamamie climb of Clubhouse shows that audio-based platforms will continue to echo around the upper echelons of the ecosystem for a while yet. Joining the fray is Heart to Heart, an audio-first dating app aiming to bring back some intimacy to the process of finding the right person for your next foray, whether that’s a saucy encounter or a mate for life. “I used to act, and from my time in acting, I saw how much voice, and audio experiences drive intimacy between people,” explains Joshua Ogundu, co-founder and CEO of Heart to Heart. “When it came down to the dating apps, it was never something I could get into. I felt like you needed to come up with a textual one-liner. That was never my way of approaching romantic conversations.” Heart to Heart is pushing back against the endless swiping and messaging of many of its competitors, offering a contrasting experience to sending the same opening line to dozens of people or typing with your thumbs until deep into the night. “I believe that the best consumer investments come from people who have unique insights on consumer behavior and ways that new tech products can allow new forms of social interaction,” said Charles Hudson from Precursor Ventures, who led the pre-seed investment round. “I have been a big fan of Josh’s TikTok videos for some time and his ability to poke at the tech industry with timely, relevant videos really showcased his creativity and ability to communicate via short-form video. I think the idea around confirming photos, storytelling, and audio will yield a product that really speaks to people’s unmet needs around communication and will create a whole new way for people to connect.” While Precursor doesn’t particularly focus on audio-first startups, the team has seen a number of opportunities in that space. It was an early investor in Howard Akumiah’s company, Betty Labs (acquired by Spotify), as well as Isa Watson’s company (Squad), Falon Fatemi’s company (Fireside) and several others that are still in stealth. “I believe that there is a major wave of interesting activity happening around non-music audio and I believe that we are still in the early innings of non-music, audio-driven social experiences,” says Hudson. “The last two companies that I feel really innovated in this category were Tinder and Bumble. I think Josh and his team have a new mechanic that feels differentiated and unique and I think it has the potential to be the foundation for a new way for people to meet and get to know each other in ways that aren’t easily accomplished today.” Joshua Ogundu, co-founder and CEO of Heart to Heart (Photo provided by Heart to Heart) The company raised the pre-seed round of $750,000. The round was led by Precursor Ventures, and Bryce Roberts of OATV & Angelica Nwandu of The Shade Room partnered on the investment, as well as Marie Rocha at Realist Ventures. In addition, a number of angel investors joined the round, including Chris Bennett (Wonderschool), Andy Weissman (USV) and Gregory Levey (Robinson Huntly). “The main thing we are trying to accomplish with the $750K, is to focus on building our iOS app, and making LA our first launch market,” says Ogundu. “Dating is such a local experience, and it makes sense to us to build and improve locally, then scaling it up from there.” “Voice is so intentional and intimate, and that is exactly what we’re building here at Heart to Heart,” says Ogundu, suggesting that the voice mechanic is helpful in a dating context because it helps slow people down. “I think that because it takes more energy to send that voice snippet to someone, you’ll be more intentional with who you even look to strike up conversations with.” The founding team consists of Joshua Ogundu, who wears the CEO hat. He is joined by Arihant Jain and Komal Shrivastava, who have been heading up the engineering and design efforts. The company hopes to get its product to market by the end of the year.",2021-10-25 18:30:46,,,techcrunch,"[('Charles Hudson from', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY'), ('Spotify', 'MEDICINE'), ('Joshua Ogundu,', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY'), ('& Angelica Nwandu', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY'), ('Rocha at', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY'), ('Gregory Levey', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY'), ('Robinson Huntly)', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY'), ('Joshua Ogundu,', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY')]"

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Ed Sheeran (@teddysphotos) Already Releases Songs The uptempo first single, “Bad Habits,” rode the top spot on the English singles charts for eleven weeks and peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 tally. It was accompanied by a high-gloss video in which Sheeran stars as a glam vampire. The dance pop tune “Shivers” entered at No. 1 on the UK charts, displacing “Habits” and topped-out at No. 10 on the Hot 100. He spends another late night looking for love in the special effects-heavy “Shivers” video, which finds Ed dressing up in an homage to pal Elton John’s feathery outfits and hanging out in a morgue with his beloved. YouTube Shorts Preview If you simply cannot wait to hear the album, Sheeran provided Sheerios with a first-of-its-kind preview of the album via a collab with YouTube on a series of 14 video shorts — one for each song on the album — which dropped on Monday morning (Oct. 25). The clips, which each run 20 seconds or less, cover a wide range of scenes, from Sheeran pounding the drums to the high-energy opening track “Tides,” to him stepping into a bathtub filled with ice while wearing a suit in the “Shivers” bit and smiling at a man dancing in a doorway with a giant bowl of chips for “Bad Habits.” Elsewhere, Sheeran and his wife Cherry lounge around, kiss and flirt in the affecting preview of the gentle acoustic ballad “First Times,” Ed busts out a spray can for some freestyle painting to the strains of the wistful acoustic pop gem “Overpass Graffiti” and he spotlights his cat’s adventures in the adorable “The Joker and the Queen” short for the hushed piano ballad. We also hear a bit of the yearning mid-tempo “Leave Your Life,” the remix-ready dance pop tracks “Collide,” “2Step” and “Stop the Rain,” as well as the sweeping acoustic jangle of “Love in Slow Motion,” the tear-stained acoustic homage to those we’ve lost, “Visiting Hours,” the bouncy lullaby “Sandman” and the bubbling, beat-driven album closer “Be Right Now.” {""nid"":""9650211"",""type"":""post"",""title"":""Ed Sheeran Tests Positive for COVID-19 Days Ahead of His New Album Release"",""relative_path"":""\/articles\/news\/9650211\/ed-sheeran-tests-positive-covid-19\/"",""media"":{""width"":1548,""height"":1024,""extension"":""jpg"",""mime_type"":""image\/jpeg"",""type"":""image"",""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/09\/ed-sheeran-2021-vma-billboard-1548-1631733909-compressed.jpg"",""sizes"":[{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/09\/ed-sheeran-2021-vma-billboard-1548-1631733909-compressed.jpg"",""width"":1548,""height"":1024},{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/09\/ed-sheeran-2021-vma-billboard-1548-1631733909-compressed.jpg"",""width"":1548,""height"":1024}],""orientation"":""landscape"",""id"":""9630573"",""caption"":null,""credit"":null}} Tour Dates Though he hasn’t yet unveiled his North American tour plans, Sheeran has dropped the dates for his upcoming 2022 UK/European stadium tour, which will include shows in Belfast, Manchester, London, Amsterdam, Paris, Copenhagen and Belfast.

She has been diagnosed with breast cancer. “He’s very smug,” Polsky said. “And I told him several times, ‘I have this very serious medical condition.’ And he said, ‘That’s OK,’ like it basically has nothing to do with what we are talking about.’”Ladapo has questioned the vaccine’s efficacy and safety, and like DeSantis, opposes shot mandates. Florida was hit hard by the latest wave of the virus, accounting at one point for a fifth of U.S. cases. Pediatricians Should Vaccinate Kids, Gottlieb Says (1:09 p.m. NY)Children ages 5 to 11 should be vaccinated in their pediatrician’s offices, said Scott Gottlieb, former head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. He’s a board member of Pfizer Inc., whose vaccine is to be considered for authorization for young children. “Getting children vaccinated is a much more consultative endeavor,” Gottlieb said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “You don’t want children to have to go to mass vaccination sites or even necessarily a pharmacy. You want them to go into the comfort of their own pediatrician’s office.”He said the vaccine, developed with BioNTec SE, will be packaged for doctors’ offices.U.S. Kids Set for Shots by Early November (11:30 a.m. NY)Two top U.S. health officials signaled confidence that children ages 5 to 11 will begin getting Covid-19 vaccines by early November. “If all goes well, and we get the regulatory approval ... it’s entirely possible if not very likely that vaccines will be available for children from five to 11 within the first week or two of November,” Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, said on ABC’s “This Week.”His comments were echoed by Rochelle Walensky, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which must ultimately approve the shots. “There will be vaccine out there so children can start rolling up their sleeves,” Walensky said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”Health experts say vaccinating children will be a key step in helping end the U.S. outbreak, though a Kaiser Family Foundation study found in September that only about a third of parents would vaccinate their children immediately. Almost 65 million eligible Americans ages 12 and older are not vaccinated. Advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will meet Tuesday to consider data for children’s use of the vaccine by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE. Approval by the FDA and the CDC is also required.Sunak Plays Down New U.K. Curbs (6:18 a.m. NY)U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak told the BBC that available Covid-19 data don’t support a move to harsher restrictions. Speaking against a backdrop of rising virus cases and ahead of his budget this week, Sunak said a return to the furlough program that saw the government pay as much as 80% of the wages of idled workers was not on the cards. “We don’t envisage having to impose significant economic restrictions in the way that we had to over the last year.”Malaysia Sees Further Drop in Cases (4:49 p.m. HK)Malaysia recorded the fewest cases since the end of June. The Southeast Asian country added 5,666 new infections Sunday, bringing the total number of cases to more than 2.43 million, according to a tweet by Health Malaysia Director-General Noor Hisham Abdullah. Meanwhile, almost 95% of Malaysia’s adult population have received a complete dose of vaccines, according to the health ministry’s data.Russia Deaths, Cases Remain Near Record (4:17 p.m. HK)Russian coronavirus cases and deaths remained near record levels on Sunday ahead of the implementation of strict nationwide curbs to stem a surge in infections.There were 35,660 new cases and 1,072 deaths over the past day, slightly below records set Saturday, according to data from the national coronavirus headquarters. Last week, President Vladimir Putin ordered nationwide non-working days for the first week of November to slow the spread, while Moscow will be closed for most business from Oct. 28 through Nov. 7.China Expects Outbreak to Widen (4:08 p.m. HK)China’s new Covid-19 infections will increase in coming days and the areas affected by the pandemic may continue to expand.The current outbreak in China is caused by the delta variant, Wu Liangyou, an official at the National Health Commission, said at a briefing in Beijing on Sunday. The outbreak has expanded to 11 provinces in the week since Oct. 17, Mi Feng, a spokesman for the commission, said at the same briefing.Earlier on Sunday, Beijing authorities announced the city is halting cross-province tourism and closing card and majhong rooms. China’s capital will also cut the number of large events and increase supervision over small clinics and pharmacies, according to the official WeChat account of the Beijing Municipal Health Commission.Belgium to Weigh Stricter Rules (3:21 p.m. HK)Belgian Prime Minister Alexander de Croo will meet with his cabinet Monday to discuss the virus situation and consider tighter curbs. The government is mulling a return to stricter mask rules, Belga reports, citing a government spokesman. Belgium, like other European countries, is seeing rising infections, with more than 8.5 million of a population of about 11.5 million being fully vaccinated. ©2021 Bloomberg L.P.With assistance from Bloomberg.

Just like last year, Halloween will look a little different as public health officials encourage people to implement measures to help curb the pandemic at a time when Saskatchewan is still experiencing high levels of COVID-19. Creative ways to maintain physical distancing while handing out candy include using tongs to pass it out or sliding it down a pipe. Sticking with your own household or small groups of close friends this Halloween is also recommended. Both trick-or-treaters and those handing out treats should wear a mask. It’s important to note that Halloween masks aren’t a substitute for medical ones. Other safety tips include cleaning and disinfecting common touch areas like handrails, doorbells and doorknobs frequently while handing out candy. Kids should carry sanitizer with them. Only individually wrapped candy should be accepted and you may want to consider a quarantine or disinfection of the wrappers before consuming the candy. The Government of Saskatchewan said proof of vaccination and masking orders remain in effect for any Halloween celebrations at public venues. The City of Prince Albert said with Halloween falling on a Sunday this year, there is an expectation that more kids will be out and about collecting treats. Similar to last year, the city created two posters that residents can print off to indicate if they will be participating in festivities. “People’s decision to participate should be respected. The Halloween posters are a simple way to let people know if you’re participating in Halloween this year,“ said Jim Toye, city manager. “The posters were tremendously popular last year, so we are making them available again this year.” The posters are can be downloaded here.

LINGARD SET FOR TRANSFER INTEREST As many as 12 Premier League clubs could join the January transfer hunt for Manchester United midfielder Jesse Lingard, one journalist has claimed. The 28-year-old was once a key player for the Red Devils, but his influence has waned. Indeed, he became frozen out under manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and sought a move away. While Lingard impressed on loan at West Ham last season, though, he has gone back to a similar level of game time as before. In fact, he has only played 55 minutes in the Premier League across four games this term. Overall, meanwhile, he has played 146 minutes in seven Man Utd outings. As such, speculation has emerged again that Lingard could leave again, this time for good, especially since his contract expires next summer. According to Sky Sports News journalist Michael Bridge, Newcastle – with their new super-rich owners – will be one of several Premier League clubs thinking about signing him in the coming months. “I think Lingard will definitely be the talk of January,” the reporter told Give Me Sport. “I’d imagine Newcastle will go for him. I’d say about 12 Premier League clubs will probably register an interest.” Previous reports have claimed that Everton lead West Ham in the race for the England international, who continues to impress Three Lions boss Gareth Southgate despite his lack of club minutes.

Getty Images The Green Bay Packers placed wide receiver Davante Adams on the reserve/COVID-19 list Monday. Being placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list is for a player who either tests positive for COVID-19 or who has been in close contact with an infected person or persons. Adams ranks second in the NFL with 52 catches and is third in yards (744). Green Bay (6-1) travels to Arizona (7-0) Thursday for an NFC showdown, and playing without Adams would be an enormous blow to the Packers. Green Bay learned earlier on Monday that defensive coordinator Joe Barry had also tested positive for COVID-19 and will likely miss Thursday’s game in Arizona. “You have to take it in stride and just approach it with positive mind and a positive attitude and just make the best of whatever situation you encounter,” Packers coach Matt LaFleur said. After a rocky start to his career, Adams — a second round draft pick in 2014 — has developed into one of the top receivers in football. Adams was named to the Pro Bowl each season from 2017-20 and he was named first-team All-Pro in 2020. Adams was the NFL’s No. 1 rated wide receiver by Pro Football Focus last season. Adams set a franchise record with 115 receptions and posted 1,374 receiving yards (11.9 avg.) a year ago despite missing two games. He also matched Sterling Sharpe’s single-season team record for receiving touchdowns (18) set in 1994.

He led the NFL in receiving TDs, receiving yards per game (98.1) and receptions per game (8.2), becoming the first NFL player to lead the league in all three categories since Sharpe did so in 1992. Adams earned first-team All-Pro honors from The Associated Press, the first Packers wide receiver to receive first-team recognition since Antonio Freeman in 1998. He also earned first-team All-NFL honors from the Pro Football Writers Association. “There’s a reason he’s got that ‘99’ rating in Madden,” LaFleur said recently. “He is a baller. I don’t think there’s anybody better than him. We’re fortunate to have him.” For the time being, though, Green Bay doesn’t.

KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 25 — As Japan gears up for its general election on Oct 31, a city in Gunma Prefecture is racing against time to sharpen pencils for voters to use.This is part of the Covid-19 pandemic measure to prevent the spread of the virus, Sora News 24 reported.The city, Ota, anticipates a voter turnout of over 100,000 voters where they will vote using voter slips and pencils.To minimise the spread of the virus, voters in the city will take the pencils home after they fill up their ballot papers.This means one voter needs to be allotted one pencil.To complicate matters, early voting has been brought forward, meaning that the specially treated, bacteria-resistant pencils, that do not come pre-sharpened, needed to be ordered in a hurry to meet the deadline. City employees are now tasked to sharpen the pencils during their breaks in between work. One Twitter user criticised the city for getting civil servants to sharpen the pencils.“Why not order disposable pencils ? Each of these costs between six and seven yen (22 sen to 26 sen). You’re currently wasting labor costs.” なぜ使い捨て鉛筆のペグシルを発注しないのか？1本当たり6〜7円ですし、これでは人件費の無駄使いですよ。【衆院選 市職員が鉛筆1万本削る】 pic.twitter.com/Dfpo7JiLbz— TOMOKIN 友金良太 (@TOMOKIN_Voice) October 19, 2021 Another social media user said after shaving a few pencils, his fingers felt numb.“So spare a thought for the hardworking pencil sharpeners in Ota, and cross your own fingers that they manage to supply enough pencils for all the voters that need them.”",2021-10-25 04:57:42,,,malaymail,"[('@TOMOKIN_Voice', 'MEDICINE')]"

‘BMF’: Tasha Smith Says It Was Important to Humanize Big Meech and Southwest T,https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/bmf-tasha-smith-says-it-was-important-to-humanize-big-meech-and-southwest-t.html/,"['Starz', 'tv shows']",['Aramide Tinubu'],,"As a director and executive producer, Tasha Smith has been instrumental in bringing Starz's 'BMF' to the small screen. She says it was important to humanize Big Meech and Southwest T","BMF is the Starz network’s latest crime drama. Executive produced by Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson, the show, centers on the Flenory brothers’ rise and fall. Demetrius “Big Meech” Flenory (Demetrius “Lil Meech” Flenory Jr.) and Terry “Southwest T” Flenory (Da’Vinchi) began their career as small-time drug dealers in Detroit before rising to become two of the biggest drug traffickers in the country. Though the brothers were eventually imprisoned for their crimes, BMF director Tasha Smith says it’s important to humanize them and their story. Tasha Smith | Rodin Eckenroth/WireImage RELATED: What Does 50 Cent’s New Starz Show ‘BMF’ Stand For? ‘BMF’ is based on a true story The Flenory brothers came of age in the 1980s in Detroit. They began their career when they were just teens selling bags of cocaine for $50. However, when the crack cocaine epidemic exploded, their business skyrocketed. Creator and showrunner Randy Huggins was born and raised in Detroit amid the same era, so he wanted the story to remain as accurate as possible. “I took some liberties, but everything there is based on a story,” Huggins told Urban Hollywood 411. “Obviously, you can’t have people’s names in there. Obviously, some of the places may have changed.” He added, “I don’t think there’s a character in there, that I hadn’t heard of,” he said. “I may have to take a creative liberty to make an art pop a little bit more. I may have to take a creative license to make a scene funnier than it may have been, but that’s just part of telling a story. This is not a documentary.” ⁦@bmfstarz⁩ watch now on Starz! pic.twitter.com/77CuDRTaQM— Tasha (@tashasmith4real) September 26, 2021 RELATED: ‘BMF’: Who Is Eminem’s Character White Boy Rick? ‘BMF’ director Tasha Smith wanted to humanize Big Meech and Southwest T In 2005 both Southwest T and Big Meech were sentenced to prison for money laundering and drug trafficking.

Bayern Munich club members move to end Qatar Airways sponsorship at general assembly,https://www.bavarianfootballworks.com/2021/10/25/22745330/bayern-munich-club-members-qatar-airways-sponsorship-annual-general-assembly-world-cup-2022,,['John Dillon'],,,"Bayern Munich board member Andreas Jung with Hamad International Airport CEO Akbar al-Baker after the club signed a new sponsorship deal, August 14, 2017. | Photo credit should read STRINGER/AFP/Getty Images Bayern’s hotly debated sponsorship by Qatar Airways will be discussed at the club’s upcoming Annual General Assembly in November. A motion initiated by Bayern Munich club member Michael Ott has gained traction and attention ahead of the club’s upcoming annual general assembly on November 25: Ott has filed a motion that would oblige Bayern to allow its sponsorship deal with Qatar Airways (2016/17-2022/23) to expire and forbid the club to conclude further sponsoring deals with companies of which a majority is owned by the Qatari Emirate. The motion, which can be found online at http://katar-antrag.de/, reads in translation as follows: May the members’ assembly resolve: FC Bayern Munich e.V. [registered club], through exercise of all necessary legal and factional avenues at its disposal, influences FC Bayern Munich AG [corporation] to the effect that sponsoring contracts with Qatar Airways or other companies majority-owned by the Emirate of Qatar are allowed to expire and not extended or not concluded de novo. [Editor: FC Bayern e.V. is the overarching club, which is majority owner of FC Bayern AG, the corporation that comprises the original soccer branch of the club. The annual general assembly includes the entire FC Bayern, from the chess team to the soccer team.] Ott sets out the justification for the measure in five detailed points. He told Bild, “We want to take preventative measures to prevent a new contract.” The principal reason is Qatar’s history of human rights violations. Ott explains, “Qatar Airways is 100% owned by the Emirate of Qatar. This country stands for massive human rights violations, and there moreover are serious charges of corruption in sports. Instead of effecting change, FC Bayern is actively helping the Emirate of Qatar with its sponsorship to draw attention away from these evils.” With such “indifference,” Ott argues, FC Bayern damages its own reputation and “falls short of its status as an exemplary model.” The motion would not, however, preclude Bayern from traveling to its annual training camp at the Aspire Academy in Doha, Qatar. Ott said that the event provides “an opportunity for critical communication, at least in theory.” I have commented several times on Bayern Munich’s relationship with Qatar Airways over the years. Bayern first visited Qatar in 2011, not long after Qatar made its controversial, and ultimately successful, bid to host World Cup 2022. Qatar’s Hamad International Airport became a “platinum sponsor” of the club in 2016, leading to the notorious Qatar Airways sleeve sponsorship in 2017. Recently, controversy over Qatar has been overshadowed by other themes, notably the Bayern leadership’s indignant response to insults leveled by its ultras at TSG Hoffenheim owner Dietmar Hopp, ensuing—arguably belated—engagement with the Black Lives Matter movement, and above all the Coronavirus pandemic. Even as the club still finds itself navigating difficult waters with respect to COVID-19 and vaccination, the subject of Qatar has not gone away. As World Cup 2022 looms on the horizon, despite the logistical nightmare a winter World Cup will create and ongoing allegations of corruption in the award process, the theme is bound to remain relevant.

Read More",2021-10-25 11:44:06,"BUCHAREST/MOSCOW — Russia reported a record high number of daily COVID-19 cases and some central European countries imposed fresh restrictions on Monday, as a new wave of the pandemic gathered pace. In Asia, the Red Cross called for urgent help for Papua New Guinea and China’s latest outbreak forced the capital Beijing to delay its annual marathon and step up other curbs, less than four months before it hosts the Winter Olympics. Authorities around the world have been sounding the alarm as infections surge, with governments in regions where vaccine uptake has been low forced to toughen up restrictions in a bid to stop the virus raging out of control. Russia on Monday reported 37,930 new COVID-19 infections in the last 24 hours, its highest single-day case tally since the start of the pandemic. Frustrated by the slow take-up of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine by its own population, authorities are introducing stricter measures this week to try to curb the spread of the pandemic. President Vladimir Putin last week declared that Oct. 30 to Nov. 7 would be paid non-working days. Vaccine skepticism is high across central and eastern Europe and as a result the region has become a hotspot. Tougher restrictions came into force in Romania and the Czech Republic on Monday, while in Slovakia stricter rules were expanded to more regions. In Bulgaria, police will start imposing fines on people who break restrictions from Monday. In Romania, where a government official on Saturday lamented a “disaster situation,” the government reintroduced a night curfew and made health passes mandatory for entry to most public venues, while school children were sent on vacation for two weeks. “The restrictions seem to be working, there are fewer people on the streets,” said Gheorghe Ion, a Bucharest cab driver. “I’ve been waiting here for an hour without an order.” Poland’s health minister warned that the government would need to consider tighter restrictions if cases kept increasing, but stressed that it was not planning a lockdown. While experts have said that a lack of confidence in public institutions caused by decades of Communist rule has fueled vaccine skepticism in the region, there were signs that more people were responding to fears about the wave by getting a jab. In Romania authorities said inoculations were on the rise last week, while in the Czech Republic the daily number of doses administered was the highest since late-August. URGENT EFFORTS The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies warned of the potential for huge numbers of deaths in Papua New Guinea unless international action was taken to help the island nation’s struggling health service. Less than 1% of the population has been fully vaccinated, according to Our World in Data figures, with the Red Cross blaming misinformation, public apprehension, and logistical challenges. “Urgent efforts and further support are needed in healthcare to prevent a massive loss of life in the coming days and weeks,” Uvenama Rova, PNG Red Cross secretary general, said. Chinese health officials warned on Sunday that its latest cluster, caused by the highly transmissible Delta variant and involving many carriers who recently traveled across some provinces, was increasingly likely to expand further. Beijing has banned entry of people from other cities with cases, and closed indoor venues such as some chess and card parlors, even in districts without infections. Although the infection numbers are far smaller than many places outside China, authorities have adopted a zero tolerance strategy. New Zealand saw its second-highest daily tally of COVID-19 cases since the pandemic began, with 109 new locally acquired coronavirus cases reported on Monday, the bulk of them in its largest city, Auckland. Once lauded for its success in stamping out the virus, New Zealand has been struggling with an outbreak of the Delta variant centered in Auckland, despite the city remaining under a strict lockdown for more than two months. In Western Europe cases were also on the rise, despite higher rates of vaccine uptake than in the continent’s east. Infections in the Netherlands have been rising for a month and reached their highest level since July on Sunday, after many social distancing measures were dropped in late September. Prime Minister Mark Rutte is expected to update coronavirus policies by Nov. 5, but pressure is rising to come up with an earlier response to the recent numbers.

Venues are also now able to determine their own table limits and liquor service hours are returning to normal. There are some health rules still in place: everyone must be double vaccinated and everyone must be masked indoors. In addition, there is still no dancing allowed, which wedding planners have called disappointing and concert venues have said is confusing.

Events and certain non-essential settings in Abbotsford, Harrison Hot Springs, Boston Bar, Mission, Hope, Chilliwack, and Agassiz are only open to those who are double vaccinated, and even then, attendance is limited. In the Interior, gatherings in vacation rentals remain limited to your household plus five visitors, and weddings cannot be larger than 50 people. Travel to and from the Interior remains discouraged unless the traveller is fully vaccinated. In Northern Health, worship services must remain virtual and unvaccinated people are not allowed to attend indoor personal gatherings outside of their household. As of Sunday, anywhere where the B.C.

He termed the project an important document on the history of Arunachal Pradesh at a meeting with the members of the core committee and sub-committee for the recognition of the State's unsung heroes, here on Saturday. The State government had in September formed a five-member core committee headed by Mein to conduct research on the contribution of various personalities of the state in the country's freedom struggle. The committee has been tasked with collecting and examining authentic documents, archives, journals, available in the libraries and other places, seeking comments of eminent personalities and others in this regard, visiting places of relevant historical interests and taking steps as deemed fit to give recognition to the unsung freedom fighters of Arunachal. The research work and documentation, after being compiled and completed, would be forwarded to the State government. Chief Minister Pema Khandu who has been spearheading the initiative had told the Assembly in September that the State government would build a memorial for all the ""unsung"" freedom fighters from the State, besides requesting the Centre to also honour them. Mein on the occasion also informed the members of the house that the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR), a captive body of the Union Ministry of Education, is planning to conduct a workshop-cum-seminar in the State early next year as part of Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav. He asked Rajiv Gandhi University Vice-Chancellor Saket Kushwaha and member secretary of the core committee, Dani Salu, to coordinate with the member-secretary of ICHR. Meanwhile, the house present decided to propose the ICHR to set up a centre in Arunachal Pradesh. Such a centre in the State would facilitate the research scholars and students carrying out research works and studies on the rich history and culture of Arunachal Pradesh, the members of the panel said. The committee also decided to participate in the live online series on social media on unsung heroes which would be conducted by ICHR. Prof Kushwaha during the meeting, presented a timeline to be followed by the sub-committee which shall work under the aegis of the RGU. According to the timeline, the sub-committee will submit the final report by the end of June 2022. In the meeting, Nepha Wangsa, author of The Nyinu Massacre, showed the collection of original documents from the national archive of the British Library in New Delhi. These documents will be handed over to the core committee through a formal ceremony at a later date. The house decided to store it in the State archive of the research department and also to put it on a website after the finalization of the research and documentation works.

Vancouver Canucks eager for return to home arena packed with fans,https://panow.com/2021/10/25/vancouver-canucks-eager-for-return-to-home-arena-packed-with-fans/,,,,VANCOUVER - The Vancouver Canucks have missed their fans.

It’s been nearly 600 days since the club has played a regular-season game in front of a home crowd, a stretch that’s set to end Tuesday when Vancouver hosts the Minnesota Wild. Goalie Thatcher Demko remembers the last time he and his teammates heard the cheers of a packed Rogers Arena. It was back on March 10, 2020 when the Canucks snatched a 5-4 shootout win over New York Islanders in front of an 18,871-strong crowd. “It’s crazy to think that we haven’t seen our fans in that long,” Demko said Monday. “I know everyone’s excited about it, we’ve been talking about it. We were getting a little itchy on the road there, wanting to get home and play some home games here.” Much has changed over the past 19 months. Fans in attendance Tuesday will be required to wear masks and show vaccine passports, ideas that sounded more like science fiction than everyday reality back in March 2020. For Demko, though, there’s one thread running through both games. “I was joking with my dad because he was at that (March 2020) game and he’s actually in town right now and I was like ‘Geeze, it’s been a long time. You were at the last game with friends and you’ll be at the one where we get them back, too.’ So that’s kind of cool,” the goalie said. While most NHL teams have already experienced the thrill of a home game this season, the Canucks (3-2-1) kicked off their campaign with a six-game road swing. They capped the trip with a 4-2 win over the Seattle Kraken on Saturday. “It’s not a lot of times that you start with a six-game trip and I like how we prevailed through it and got through it and played pretty well,” said Canucks head coach Travis Green. Saturday’s victory marked the first-ever home game for the Kraken, the NHL’s newest franchise. It was also the third home opener Vancouver has played this season. Each was an exciting game in a hostile environment, Demko said. “The fans are such a massive element to what we do on a nightly basis, whether we’re at home or on the road,” he said. It’s an element some players missed last season, when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the Canucks — and many other NHL teams — to play in empty arenas against the same teams again and again. Fans have a significant impact on games, said Vancouver centre Elias Pettersson. “It’s like an extra player almost,” he said. “Last year made me realize fans play a big part in just getting you going in a game. So the fans, they play a big part.” Last week, the B.C. government announced it was lifting capacity limits on indoor sporting events, starting Monday as the province’s new vaccine passport regulations came into effect. The move means the Canucks can have 100 per cent capacity for Tuesday’s home opener, though tickets were still available as of Monday afternoon. Having a full building will be exciting for the whole team, said coach Green. “Not only coming off a road trip, a long road trip here, you’re always excited to get home and play in front of fans,” he said. “It’s been so long. It’s going to be a lot of energy in our building.” The Canucks and Wild haven’t face one another since August 2020, when Vancouver beat Minnesota in a four-game series held in the NHL’s post-season “bubble” in Edmonton. The Wild (4-1-0) have looked strong early this season, winning four straight before dropping a 5-2 decision to the Nashville Predators on Sunday. The visitors will be hungry for a win, Green said. “(Tuesday’s) game is going to be a tough game. Minnesota’s got a lot of depth, they’ve got a lot of sides and they can skate,” he said. “They’re playing with some confidence and some swagger which you would be when you have a start like that.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published Oct. 25, 2021.

Supporters of paid sick leave in B.C. advocate from Vancouver and Victoria,https://vancouver.citynews.ca/2021/10/24/vancouver-victoria-paid-sick-leave/,,['alylaube'],,People in Vancouver and Victoria who want B.C. to give workers 10 paid sick days took to the streets Monday to rally for action from the Horgan government.,"A so-called “COVID-safe Day of Action” is taking place Monday in Metro Vancouver and Victoria, with groups hoping to pressure the Horgan government to follow through with its plans to bring in mandatory paid sick leave for workers. Raj Khunkhun, VP with Community Savings Credit Union, says his organization is advocating for 10 paid sick days. “We’re lagging behind comparable countries like New Zealand and Australia. They already introduced 10 paid sick days. Germany actually has 30,” he said. “The federal government is poised to bring in 10 paid sick days for federally regulated workers, so we think B.C. should introduce 10 paid sick days as well.” Related Articles: B.C. seeks input on length of paid sick leave Some B.C. businesses still resistant to paid sick leave: CFIB Health-care workers demand Trudeau fast track paid sick-leave policy The Horgan government is expected to pass legislation before the end of the year to bring in paid sick leave, despite opposition from certain groups — including the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. But Khunkhun says having provincially-mandated paid sick days isn’t going to deter businesses. “We have always provided 12 paid sick days, but we provided a further 10 paid sick days during the pandemic, very early on, and also an additional six hours a week off just to get groceries because the line-ups were long,” said Khunkhun. They found there was no impact to their bottom line and had their most profitable year to-date. “We don’t want people to have to decide between getting paid fully and putting others at risk. We don’t think that should be a burden on the worker. They should also be able to take the time off, and that will also help our healthcare system, which is already really stressed right now,” added Khunkhun.",2021-10-25 00:59:19,,https://vancouver.citynews.ca/wp-content/blogs.dir/sites/9/2021/01/sneeze-1431371.jpg,citynews1130,[]

BYU’s win over Wazzu a confidence-builder ahead of former coach Bronco Mendenhall coming to town,https://www.deseret.com/2021/10/24/22741210/byu-football-bronco-mendenhall-kalani-sitake-clark-barrington-brennan-armstrong-malik-moore,,['Jay Drew'],,,"BYU running back Tyler Allgeier, right, carries the ball while pressured by Washington State linebacker Jahad Woods during the second half of an NCAA college football game, Saturday, Oct. 23, 2021, in Pullman, Wash. | Young Kwak, Associated Press Having gone 4-0 against Pac-12 teams with the 21-19 win over Washington State, BYU turns its attention to one of the nation’s top offenses in explosive Virginia Offensive lineman Clark Barrington climbed onto the railing at Martin Stadium to salute the thousands of BYU fans who made the trip to the Palouse to watch their beloved Cougars play, including a couple dozen relatives and family friends. Defensive back Malik Moore joked after dropping a couple interceptions — easier to do after a win and one successful pick, no doubt — and bruising running back Tyler Allgeier said he was as sore as he’s ever been after a game. Thirty-two carries, including seven straight when everybody in the place knew the ball was going to BYU’s best player and he ran it down Wazzu’s throat anyway, will do that to a guy. “We knew that we would face adversity, and one thing we have been focusing on all week is getting through that adversity and staying up and helping each other out and pushing along. So that is what the vibe was in the locker room — that we are going to get through this, we are going to continue to drive the ball, our defense will do their best to get stops, and we will come out on top.” — BYU offensive lineman Clark Barrington For this resilient bunch of Cougars, Saturday’s 21-19 win over Washington State came as a relief as much as anything else. BYU became the only team in the country to beat four Pac-12 teams to date, but this victory was more about building its own confidence, after a two-game losing skid put BYU in what head coach Kalani Sitake called “a slump.” Imagine what Arizona coaches are calling their 19-game slide. Whatever the case, this is a win BYU desperately needed, what with Bronco Mendenhall and his 6-2 Virginia Cavaliers coming back to Provo this week for an 8:15 p.m. late-night special Saturday at LaVell Edwards Stadium. “Getting a win, it always boosts your confidence, and so it is nice to have another win,” said Barrington, the left guard who teamed with left tackle Blake Freeland to clear the way for Allgeier to pick up 9 yards on his final carry and secure the first down so BYU wouldn’t have to call on Spokane native Ryan Rehkow to pin WSU deep in the final minute. Added Moore, the ballhawking safety who invited social media followers after the game to needle him all they wanted for the drops — for one day: “I think for sure it picks up our confidence a lot, and shows us we are not out of it, we are no scrubs, you know?,” he said. “I think everybody’s chin was down, worrying about the last two games. This game really proved to us that we still got it, we are still a good team, we have won six games. Not a lot of teams are doing that, so we’re good.” In getting bowl eligible before Halloween — an unexpected development for a team that lost Zach Wilson and more than a dozen other key contributors — the Cougars are sort of playing with house money from here on out, with Virginia and USC looming as the only possible stumbling blocks to a 10-win season.

I feel really fortunate and happy that we got the win.” Allgeier, who is now seventh in the country in rushing yards (861) and sixth in rushing touchdowns (11), said another win in Pac-12 territory was just what the doctor ordered before what is sure to be an emotional game against Mendenhall and company. “I would say it brings the confidence back up,” Allgeier said. “We are 0-0 now, but we gotta keep that momentum going forward.” It won’t be easy against the Hoos, who beat Georgia Tech 48-40 on Saturday in Charlottesville and have won four straight behind the sensational quarterbacking of Brennan Armstrong. The 6-foot-2, 215-pound junior from Shelby, Ohio, leads the country in passing yards (3,220) and is second in passing yards per game (402.5). Virginia is fourth in the country in total offense, putting up 539.9 yards per game with former BYU offensive coordinator Robert Anae doing the play-calling. Defensively, though, the Hoos are below average. They are giving up 432.8 yards per game, which ranks them 105th in the country. They are especially susceptible to the run — ranking 113th in rushing defense.

Pac-12 men’s basketball preview: Can league capitalize on record-setting NCAA Tournament performances?,https://www.deseret.com/2021/10/25/22732726/pac-12-basketball-preview-utah-utes-coach-craig-smith-commissioner-george-kliavkoff-jamie-zaninovich,,['Jay Drew'],,,"UCLA players celebrate after an Elite 8 game against Michigan at Lucas Oil Stadium, Wednesday, March 31, 2021, in Indianapolis. UCLA won 51-49. With all their key contributors returning this season, the Bruins are sure to be a tough out for the Utes and the other Pac-12 teams this season. | Darron Cummings, Associated Press New Runnin’ Utes coach Craig Smith enters a Pac-12 basketball race that is as deep and loaded as ever after impressive NCAA Tournament showing in 2021 SAN FRANCISCO — A razor-close overtime loss to undefeated Gonzaga in a Final Four game. Three teams in the Elite Eight. Four teams in the Sweet 16. Five teams in the Round of 32. A conference-record 13 total wins in the 2021 NCAA Tournament. Add it all up, and it begs the question: What will Pac-12 men’s basketball teams do for an encore in the 2022 Big Dance after the most successful overall showing in conference history last March? “We have great reasons for optimism in the Pac-12,” deputy commissioner and chief operating officer Jamie Zaninovich said at the league’s men’s basketball media day last week at conference headquarters in San Francisco. “The collective commitment to basketball throughout the conference is very important. Our shared objective is to optimize tournament bids and ultimately cut down the nets as national champions.” — Pac-12 commissioner George Kliavkoff The good news for the league is that many of the top players who helped turn the conference’s unexpected success into the story of March Madness last spring are back for more this year. Although only two Pac-12 teams made The Associated Press Top 25 preseason poll released Monday — UCLA is at No. 2 and Oregon is at No. 13 — the league is seemingly gaining more respect with each passing year. Arizona, USC and Colorado received votes, along with BYU, which will play two Pac-12 teams this year — Utah and Oregon. “We are excited about the momentum we have from last season, and confident in the talented student-athletes and great leadership from our coaches,” said new Pac-12 commissioner George Kliavkoff last week. “The collective commitment to basketball throughout the conference is very important. Our shared objective is to optimize tournament bids and ultimately cut down the nets as national champions.” That hasn’t been done since Lute Olson’s Arizona Wildcats won it all in 1997. Into that momentum, and improvement after some lackluster Big Dance showings from 2017-2019, steps new University of Utah coach Craig Smith. The only other new coach is Arizona’s Tommy Lloyd, the former top assistant under Mark Few at Gonzaga. “Certainly, being a part of this amazing conference — the Pac-12, the Conference of Champions, is what they say. Or at least somebody does. To be a part of that is awesome. It is something you want to be a part of, right?,” Smith said, flanked by returnees Branden Carlson and Riley Battin, when it was Utah’s turn to address the media on Oct. 13. “Bring on the competition.” Actually, the league has been trending up since 2020, when up to six teams were expected to get NCAA Tournament bids before the Big Dance was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But few saw the 2021 success coming. In retrospect, every team was probably under-seeded, from Final Four participant UCLA — which upset BYU in a first-round game — to surprise conference tournament champion Oregon State to USC, Colorado and Oregon (which was eliminated by another Pac-12 school, USC). “To finally see the Pac-12 in men’s basketball capture the attention of the basketball world, in March Madness, is truly remarkable and again, a testament to our student-athletes, coaches, administrators, everybody,” Zaninovich said. Some of the league’s NCAA Tournament failures in past years, or unimpressive showings in nonconference games, have been explained away by league officials as the conference having too many one-and-done players leaving early for the NBA. That didn’t happen this offseason, as preseason all-conference selections Johnny Juzang of UCLA, Warith Alatishe of Oregon State, Marcus Bagley of Arizona State and Isaiah Mobley of USC opted to return, “when they had pro opportunities in front of them, but chose to come back to school and invest in their collegiate experience,” Zaninovich said. As it were, the league produced three NBA lottery picks in 2021 — more than any other conference. Four all-freshman team players returned, and will be joined by 10 all-conference transfers, including MAC Player of the Year Marreon Jackson, the former Toledo star who is moving on to Arizona State. Zaninovich said four McDonald’s All-Americans will join the Pac-12 this year, and 12 players from ESPN’s Top 100 recruits list. Smith and Lloyd join a group of coaches who have more than 3,000 wins and 148 years of coaching experience. “The coaching in this league is obviously remarkable,” Zaninovich said. What else does the 2021-22 season hold for the Pac-12? Officials announced that the Pac-12 championship game at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas will tip off in prime time on the East Coast and will be televised by Fox. Also, the Pac-12 will host an NCAA Regional at the Chase Center in San Francisco — the first time in 80 years that San Francisco will host an NCAA Tournament game, the last one having been played at nearby Treasure Island. This will be the second season in which Pac-12 schools will play 20 conference games each. Before that, there will be some huge opportunities for Pac-12 teams to get big national wins. Stanford, Oregon and Arizona State will all get a shot at defending national champion Baylor; Washington and UCLA will play preseason AP No. 1 Gonzaga. Also, Oregon will play in the Maui Invitational and ASU will play in the Battle 4 Atlantis with opportunities to run across top-ranked teams in later rounds. Pac-12 teams will meet power-conference teams at least 20 times, including Utah’s Nov. 20 game against the ACC’s Boston College at the Sunshine Slam in Daytona Beach, Florida. The Runnin’ Utes will also face the SEC’s Missouri on Dec. 18 in Columbia, Missouri, the Big 12’s TCU on Dec. 8 in Fort Worth, Texas, and will host Big 12-bound BYU on Nov. 27 at the Huntsman Center in games that will either add to, or detract from, the league’s improved reputation as a national player. Zaninovich said the league has worked hard to help schools with their nonconference scheduling to figure out what makes the most sense for them. The goal is to have Pac-12 teams win at least 75% of their nonconference games. “We looked at tons of data of the NCAA Tournament, historically, and in most every case, if a conference wins 75% of its nonconference games, at least 50% of their teams advance to the NCAA Tournament,” Zaninovich said. Here’s a closer look at each team’s prospects in 2021-22, in order of how they were selected to finish in the preseason media poll: 1. UCLA Darron Cummings, Associated Press UCLA guard Tyger Campbell, right, celebrates with teammate guard Jaime Jaquez Jr. (4) after an Elite 8 game against Michigan in the NCAA men’s college basketball tournament at Lucas Oil Stadium, in Indianapolis on Wednesday, March 31, 2021. UCLA won 51-49. UCLA is an overwhelming favorite to win the Pac-12 after reaching the Final Four last season. All five starters and every other contributor to the Bruins’ Final Four run returned for coach Mick Cronin, making UCLA an easy pick to win the league. Starters such as Juzang, Tyger Campbell, Jules Bernard, Cody Riley and Jaime Jaquez Jr. will be joined by key newcomers Peyton Watson, Will McClendon and Rutgers transfer Myles Johnson to give the Bruins arguably the best team in the country. “Conference success in our sport is important because of NCAA Tournament bids,” Cronin said at media day. “We are all playing to go to the NCAA Tournament, and getting quality seeds. So conference power, success, all of it, is huge. … I think we proved last year that Pac-12 basketball is powerful.” Juzang and Jaquez said there’s a heightened sense of excitement in Westwood these days, thanks to that tournament run. “We are just as excited as them,” Juzang said. Cronin said the Bruins have “the greatest tradition” in the history of college basketball and feel more pressure to live up to that standard than to repeat last year’s run. 2.

Richardson will be back for the Ducks in 2021-22, and is considered one of the better point guards in the league. The Ducks lost quality players Chris Duarte, LJ Figueroa and Eugene Omoruyi, but did well in the transfer portal market, landing Syracuse’s Quincy Guerrier, Oklahoma’s De’Vion Harmon and Jacob Young of Rutgers. They will join one of the Pac-12’s better returning point guards, Will Richardson, to give coach Dana Altman another league championship contender. Former American Fork star Isaac Johnson, a 7-footer, will join the program after having served a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints the past two years. Altman was asked at media day how much longer he will stay in coaching. “I don’t have anything else,” he said. “I am 63. I would like to go on as long as Oregon will have me. … I don’t know what I would do if I didn’t go to the gym every day.” 3. USC (AP Photo/Paul Sancya, Associated Press USC forward Evan Mobley (4) and USC forward Isaiah Mobley (3) watch from the bench during game against Kansas in the second round of the NCAA Tournament at Hinkle Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, Monday, March 22, 2021. While Evan has moved on to the NBA (the No. 3 overall pick in the 2021 NBA draft) Isaiah returns to the Trojans this season. A lot of experts say the Trojans will sorely miss Evan Mobley, the No. 3 pick in July’s NBA draft. They will. But they will also miss reliable guard Tahj Eaddy, the Santa Clara transfer who helped USC eliminate Utah 91-85 in double overtime in the Pac-12 quarterfinals last spring. Coach Andy Enfield does get back Mobley’s brother, Isaiah, and point guard Ethan Anderson and wings Isaiah White and Drew Peterson. Forwards Max Agbonkpolo and Chavez Goodwin also return, which is why USC should make the Big Dance again. “We have a lot of versatilely, but our guards have to be good for us if we hope to get back,” Enfield said.”… The excitement around our program is at an all-time high since I have been here the last eight seasons.” Memphis transfer Boogie Ellis brings his 10.2 scoring average to the team. The coach said the Pac-12’s showing in the tournament “gave our conference a tremendous boost. We were rooting for everyone else as if it were our own program.” T4. Arizona Jeff Chiu, Associated Press Arizona coach Tommy Lloyd waves while speaking during Pac-12 media day Wednesday, Oct. 13, 2021, in San Francisco. Lloyd and Utah’s Craig Smith are the two newcomer coaches to the league this season. Sure, the Wildcats have the winning tradition to fall back on, but this pick from media members who cover the Pac-12 seems high (the Deseret News picked Arizona ninth on its ballot). As mentioned previously, new coach Lloyd saw a lot of winning in more than 20 years at Gonzaga, but Ws don’t figure to come as easily in Tucson for awhile. “I might have to recalibrate what a good winning percentage feels like,” Lloyd said. “I am really looking forward to that journey where every game is going to be a battle.” Lloyd said at Gonzaga if they lost a West Coast Conference game, “it felt like you lost a seed line” for the NCAA Tournament. Bennedict Mathurin, Azuolas Tubelis and Kerr Kriisa stuck around after Sean Miller was fired, and Utah transfer Pelle Larsson should be able to step in and contribute immediately. “We have a great young nucleus to work with,” Lloyd said. T4. Oregon State Amanda Loman, Associated Press Oregon State’s Warith Alatishe shoots over Utah’s Riley Battin during game in Corvallis, Ore., Thursday, Feb. 18, 2021. Much to Oregon State coach Wayne Tinkle’s delight, Alatishe will be back for the Beavers. Before that magical three-weekend stretch in March when they won the Pac-12 Tournament and advanced to the Elite Eight, the Beavers were an average team, perhaps even less than that. Can they recapture that momentum? Coach Wayne Tinkle was able to keep most of his best players — most notably Alatishe, supreme shooter Jarod Lucas and backcourt mate Gianni Hunt. Replacing floor leader Ethan Thompson will be difficult. “This conference is going to be as deep as it has ever been,” Tinkle said, hinting that even though the Beavers have improved, the rest of the league has as well, and duplicating that run will be difficult. 6. Colorado Michael Conroy, Associated Press Colorado forward Evan Battey celebrates during a timeout against Georgetown in NCAA first-round game at Hinkle Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, Saturday, March 20, 2021. Battey will be back for the Buffs in 2021-22. Point guard McKinley Wright IV was a fixture in Boulder the past four years, and will be extremely hard to replace. But coach Tad Boyle said he likes this group, especially if a highly rated incoming freshman class contributes. The Buffs’ best returners are big man Evan Battey, forward Jabari Walker and guard Eli Parquet, who helped CU go 14-6 in league play and earn a No., 5 seed in the NCAA Tournament. Colorado reached the Round of 32 and was the only Pac-12 entrant that didn’t win two or more contests in March Madness. “We are in great shape leadership-wise, but we gotta grow up quickly,” Boyle said. 7. Arizona State Rick Scuteri, Associated Press Arizona State coach Bobby Hurley talks to Marcus Bagley during game against Arizona, Thursday, Jan. 21, 2021, in Tempe, Ariz. Convincing Bagley to return was a big win for the ASU coach. Coach Bobby Hurley scored two major wins in the offseason, getting talented forward Bagley to stick around for at least another year and luring MAC Player of the Year Marreon Jackson of Toledo to Tempe. Jackson, who averaged 18.1 points, 6.1 rebounds and 5.9 assists for the Rockets last year, will team with Ohio State transfer Luther Muhammad and Boston College transfer Jay Heath and returnees Bagley, Kimani Lawrence and Enoch Boakye to give Hurley plenty of talent with which to work. After ASU went 11-14 last year, 7-10 in the Pac-12, Hurley said watching fellow conference mates succeed in the tournament was invigorating. “I was so happy for the league, and for those colleagues, those coaches,” he said. Bagley, a 6-foot-8 sophomore, said his decision to return was “based on knowing how much better I could be.” 8. Washington State Pete Caster, Associated Press Washington State head coach Kyle Smith reacts after a foul was called during game against Stanford, Saturday, Feb. 20, 2021, in Pullman, Wash. Slowly but surely, Smith is bringing respectability to the Cougars program. The Cougars are a popular pick among some to make the NCAA Tournament for the first time in awhile, because coach Kyle Smith is slowly building something in Pullman. Wazzu returns its main rotation — led by Efe Abogidi, Dishon Jackson and Noah Williams — and should be bolstered by South Alabama transfer Michael Flowers (21.0 ppg.) and UC San Diego transfer Tyrell Roberts (19.2 ppg.), who joined Abogidi and Smith at media day. “He’s a bucket,” Smith said of the 5-11 Roberts. Having gone 7-12 in league play last year, the Cougars will hang their hat on defense once again, Smith said. “I think our talent is there,” he said. “Experience is still lacking, we are still quite youthful.” 9. Stanford David Zalubowski, Associated Press Stanford forward Jaiden Delaire, left, drives during game against Colorado Saturday, Jan. 16, 2021, in Boulder, Colo. Delaire will be among the Cardinal players trying to keep Stanford coach Jerod Haase on the sidelines this season. While Utah coach Larry Krystkowiak was clearly on the hot seat last year, and ended up losing his job, the Pac-12 coach who wears that description this year is Stanford’s Jerod Haase, along with Washington’s Mike Hopkins, perhaps. The Cardinal lost a lot, most notably Oscar da Silva, Zaire Williams and Daejon Davis, and will do well to make the tournament for the first time since 2014. Senior Jaiden Delaire, junior Spencer Jones and five-star recruit Harrison Ingram will attempt to help Haase keep his job. “Our goal is to simple — it is to be awesome,” Haase said. That might be what it takes to keep the sixth-year coach in Palo Alto for another year. 10. Utah Jeff Chiu, Associated Press Utah coach Craig Smith, left, speaks next to Riley Battin, middle, and Branden Carlson during Pac-12 media day Wednesday, Oct. 13, 2021, in San Francisco. While expectations for the Utes are not high in Smith’s first year at the helm, the players said at media day that the Utes will surprise some people in 2021-22. For the record, the Deseret News picked the Utes to finish seventh. The mass exodus since Krystkowiak was fired on March 16 has been well-documented, but Smith was able to keep Carlson and Battin in the fold (after Battin briefly entered the transfer portal) and those two said at media day that the Runnin’ Utes will surprise some people in 2021-22. “I will say this: We have gotten a lot better in a short amount of time, and I can’t wait to see where this team goes,” Smith said at media day. The feeling here is that UNLV grad transfer David Jenkins Jr. will give the Utes a nice scoring lift, and Utah State transfers Marco Anthony and Rollie Worster will add some defensive toughness that was lacking last year. “There is a lot of depth in our backcourt,” Smith said. “The words that describe our backcourt are selfless and skilled. They can shoot it, they can pass it, they can dribble it, and for the most part we are pretty tough defensively with a good feel for the game.” 11. Washington Ted S. Warren, Associated Press California guard Jarred Hyder (3) is defended by Washington forward Nate Roberts (1) as guards Jamal Bey (5) and Marcus Tsohonis (0) watch during game Saturday, Feb. 20, 2021, in Seattle. The Huskies went 15-3 in Pac-12 play in 2018-19, but have been a disaster since then, going 9-29 in league play since. The aforementioned Hopkins seemingly needs a big turnaround to keep his job. Starters Jamal Bey and Nate Roberts return, but most of the other expected contributors are transfers — guys such as Terrell Brown Jr. (Arizona), Daejon Davis (Stanford) and Emmitt Mathews Jr. (West Virginia). “We took advantage of the transfer portal,” Hopkins said. 12. California Jeff Chiu, Associated Press California forward Andre Kelly shoots against Oregon during game in Berkeley, Calif., Saturday, Feb. 27, 2021. Kelly is the Bears’ leading returning scorer. Coach Mark Fox’s best player last year, former Wasatch Academy star Matt Bradley, has transferred to San Diego State. He will be missed. Andre Kelly (10.3 ppg.) and Grant Anticevich (8.9 ppg.) are back, and are joined by Charlotte transfer Jordan Shepherd. The Bears will play at UNLV on Nov. 13 in what should be a barometer game; they will also play Florida in the Rocket Mortgage Fort Myers Tip-Off and either Ohio State or Seton Hall in the second round. “We have a nonconference schedule that is going to help us play in the best conference in America,” Fox said.",2021-10-25 16:15:22,"SAN FRANCISCO — A razor-close overtime loss to undefeated Gonzaga in a Final Four game. Three teams in the Elite Eight. Four teams in the Sweet 16. Five teams in the Round of 32. A conference-record 13 total wins in the 2021 NCAA Tournament. Add it all up, and it begs the question: What will Pac-12 men’s basketball teams do for an encore in the 2022 Big Dance after the most successful overall showing in conference history last March? “We have great reasons for optimism in the Pac-12,” deputy commissioner and chief operating officer Jamie Zaninovich said at the league’s men’s basketball media day last week at conference headquarters in San Francisco. “The collective commitment to basketball throughout the conference is very important. Our shared objective is to optimize tournament bids and ultimately cut down the nets as national champions.” — Pac-12 commissioner George Kliavkoff The good news for the league is that many of the top players who helped turn the conference’s unexpected success into the story of March Madness last spring are back for more this year. Although only two Pac-12 teams made The Associated Press Top 25 preseason poll released Monday — UCLA is at No. 2 and Oregon is at No. 13 — the league is seemingly gaining more respect with each passing year. Arizona, USC and Colorado received votes , along with BYU, which will play two Pac-12 teams this year — Utah and Oregon. “We are excited about the momentum we have from last season, and confident in the talented student-athletes and great leadership from our coaches,” said new Pac-12 commissioner George Kliavkoff last week. “The collective commitment to basketball throughout the conference is very important. Our shared objective is to optimize tournament bids and ultimately cut down the nets as national champions.” That hasn’t been done since Lute Olson’s Arizona Wildcats won it all in 1997. Into that momentum, and improvement after some lackluster Big Dance showings from 2017-2019, steps new University of Utah coach Craig Smith . The only other new coach is Arizona’s Tommy Lloyd, the former top assistant under Mark Few at Gonzaga. “Certainly, being a part of this amazing conference — the Pac-12, the Conference of Champions, is what they say. Or at least somebody does. To be a part of that is awesome. It is something you want to be a part of, right?,” Smith said, flanked by returnees Branden Carlson and Riley Battin , when it was Utah’s turn to address the media on Oct. 13. “Bring on the competition.” Actually, the league has been trending up since 2020, when up to six teams were expected to get NCAA Tournament bids before the Big Dance was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Related How will new Runnin’ Utes coach Craig Smith fare in the Pac-12? Some experts weigh in But few saw the 2021 success coming. In retrospect, every team was probably under-seeded, from Final Four participant UCLA — which upset BYU in a first-round game — to surprise conference tournament champion Oregon State to USC, Colorado and Oregon (which was eliminated by another Pac-12 school, USC). “To finally see the Pac-12 in men’s basketball capture the attention of the basketball world, in March Madness, is truly remarkable and again, a testament to our student-athletes, coaches, administrators, everybody,” Zaninovich said. Some of the league’s NCAA Tournament failures in past years, or unimpressive showings in nonconference games, have been explained away by league officials as the conference having too many one-and-done players leaving early for the NBA. That didn’t happen this offseason, as preseason all-conference selections Johnny Juzang of UCLA, Warith Alatishe of Oregon State, Marcus Bagley of Arizona State and Isaiah Mobley of USC opted to return, “when they had pro opportunities in front of them, but chose to come back to school and invest in their collegiate experience,” Zaninovich said. As it were, the league produced three NBA lottery picks in 2021 — more than any other conference. Four all-freshman team players returned, and will be joined by 10 all-conference transfers, including MAC Player of the Year Marreon Jackson, the former Toledo star who is moving on to Arizona State. Zaninovich said four McDonald’s All-Americans will join the Pac-12 this year, and 12 players from ESPN’s Top 100 recruits list. Smith and Lloyd join a group of coaches who have more than 3,000 wins and 148 years of coaching experience. Related Runnin’ Utes unfazed by being picked so low in suddenly deep Pac-12 “The coaching in this league is obviously remarkable,” Zaninovich said. What else does the 2021-22 season hold for the Pac-12? Officials announced that the Pac-12 championship game at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas will tip off in prime time on the East Coast and will be televised by Fox. Also, the Pac-12 will host an NCAA Regional at the Chase Center in San Francisco — the first time in 80 years that San Francisco will host an NCAA Tournament game, the last one having been played at nearby Treasure Island. This will be the second season in which Pac-12 schools will play 20 conference games each. Before that, there will be some huge opportunities for Pac-12 teams to get big national wins. Stanford, Oregon and Arizona State will all get a shot at defending national champion Baylor; Washington and UCLA will play preseason AP No. 1 Gonzaga. Also, Oregon will play in the Maui Invitational and ASU will play in the Battle 4 Atlantis with opportunities to run across top-ranked teams in later rounds. Pac-12 teams will meet power-conference teams at least 20 times, including Utah’s Nov. 20 game against the ACC’s Boston College at the Sunshine Slam in Daytona Beach, Florida. The Runnin’ Utes will also face the SEC’s Missouri on Dec. 18 in Columbia, Missouri, the Big 12’s TCU on Dec. 8 in Fort Worth, Texas, and will host Big 12-bound BYU on Nov. 27 at the Huntsman Center in games that will either add to, or detract from, the league’s improved reputation as a national player. Zaninovich said the league has worked hard to help schools with their nonconference scheduling to figure out what makes the most sense for them. The goal is to have Pac-12 teams win at least 75% of their nonconference games. “We looked at tons of data of the NCAA Tournament, historically, and in most every case, if a conference wins 75% of its nonconference games, at least 50% of their teams advance to the NCAA Tournament,” Zaninovich said. Here’s a closer look at each team’s prospects in 2021-22, in order of how they were selected to finish in the preseason media poll: 1. UCLA UCLA guard Tyger Campbell, right, celebrates with teammate guard Jaime Jaquez Jr. (4) after an Elite 8 game against Michigan in the NCAA men’s college basketball tournament at Lucas Oil Stadium, in Indianapolis on Wednesday, March 31, 2021. UCLA won 51-49. UCLA is an overwhelming favorite to win the Pac-12 after reaching the Final Four last season. Darron Cummings, Associated Press All five starters and every other contributor to the Bruins’ Final Four run returned for coach Mick Cronin, making UCLA an easy pick to win the league. Starters such as Juzang, Tyger Campbell, Jules Bernard, Cody Riley and Jaime Jaquez Jr. will be joined by key newcomers Peyton Watson, Will McClendon and Rutgers transfer Myles Johnson to give the Bruins arguably the best team in the country. “Conference success in our sport is important because of NCAA Tournament bids,” Cronin said at media day. “We are all playing to go to the NCAA Tournament, and getting quality seeds. So conference power, success, all of it, is huge. … I think we proved last year that Pac-12 basketball is powerful.” Juzang and Jaquez said there’s a heightened sense of excitement in Westwood these days, thanks to that tournament run. “We are just as excited as them,” Juzang said. Cronin said the Bruins have “the greatest tradition” in the history of college basketball and feel more pressure to live up to that standard than to repeat last year’s run. 2. Oregon Oregon guard Will Richardson drives to the basket ahead of Southern California guard Drew Peterson during Sweet 16 game in the NCAA men’s college basketball tournament at Bankers Life Fieldhouse, Sunday, March 28, 2021, in Indianapolis.

Moderna says study data supports use of a half-dose of the vaccine in children 6 to 11. Moderna says a study in kids 6 to 11 found two doses of the company's COVID-19 vaccine given 28 days apart produced a strong antibody response. The study, conducted in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health, used shots containing a 50 microgram dose of the vaccine, half the dose of the Moderna shots authorized for adults. More than 4,700 children ages 5 to 11 took part in the study. The most common side effects were fatigue, headache, fever and pain at the site of injection. The company says the analysis showed a ""favorable safety profile."" The summary of the study results was made available in a press release . The information hasn't been peer reviewed or published, but Moderna said it plans to submit them to a scientific journal for publication. The company also said it plans to submit the data to regulators, a move that would support the authorization of the vaccine for kids 6 to 11. The release of the data comes a day before a panel of advisers to the Food and Drug Administration will review use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in children 5 to 11 years of age. In June, Moderna submitted study results involving nearly 2,500 adolescents ages 12 to 15 to the FDA. The agency hasn't yet issued a decision on whether to expand use of the Moderna vaccine to that age group. In May, the FDA expanded authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to include adolescents 12 to 15 years of age.",,npr,"[('Moderna', 'INSURANCE COMPANY NAME')]"
"Jeff Probst Doesn’t Cut His Hair Through ‘Survivor’ Season 41 or 42, Talks ‘Impressive Mullet’",https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/jeff-probst-doesnt-cut-hair-survivor-season-41-42-talks-impressive-mullet.html/,"['Reality TV', 'Survivor']",['Lauren Weiler'],,"'Survivor' Season 41 has intense coronavirus protocol, and host Jeff Probst noted he didn't cut his hair because of quarantine. Additionally, he noted he doesn't cut his 'impressive mullet' until after 'Survivor' Season 42.","Fans following Survivor Season 41 can’t help but notice more than a few changes. In addition to the many new twists and turns added into the game, Survivor host Jeff Probst is also sporting a new look. He spoke in an interview regarding the longer hairstyle he’s sporting in the new season — and he noted it doesn’t change until the end of Survivor Season 42. Here’s what Probst had to say. ‘Survivor’ Season 41 follows intense coronavirus protocol Jeff Probst on ‘Survivor’ Season 41 | Robert Voets/CBS via Getty Images Host Jeff Probst promised Survivor Season 41 would be unlike any other season the show’s had so far. While past seasons had contestants playing the game for 39 days, the new coronavirus (COVID-19) protocol had season 41 contestants playing for only 26 days. Because of the shorter gameplay, Probst promised more twists, more turns, and tougher gameplay than ever before. “Survivor 41 will birth a new era of Survivor with a faster, more dangerous, and much more intense game,” Probst said, according to Parade. “We really leaned into having fun with this season and the best kind of Survivor fun is the dangerous kind.” The show followed additional coronavirus protocol as well to ensure the safety of the contestants and the production team. “We worked with the Fiji government to create what was essentially a large bubble that consisted of several islands — including tribe camps, challenge locations, Tribal Council, and base camp,” Probst explained to Entertainment Weekly. “This extended bubble would be our home for the next many months. Once every crew member and player had quarantined for 14 days and received a negative test, we were able to move freely between those islands, with no risk, because it was only our crew and we were all safe.” Jeff Probst said he doesn’t cut his hair until the end of ‘Survivor’ Season 42 I am thrilled to tell you all that @survivorcbs is going back into production and I will see you on the island for #Survivor 41! @CBS pic.twitter.com/RtQGVFoDDL— Jeff Probst (@JeffProbst) March 22, 2021 Viewers watching Survivor Season 41 noticed Jeff Probst’s long hair. And he’s well-aware of his new style as well. “[My] hair is longer because like so many of us, I didn’t get it cut during COVID,” Probst told Entertainment Weekly. “And as it grew, I was reminded how grateful I am to still have hair, so why not grow it! And then I decided to keep it.” Fans should get used to his long hair, too. Probst told Entertainment Weekly he wasn’t able to chop his hair until the end of Survivor Season 42. “On location, there was no way to cut it anyway, so by the end of Survivor 42, I have a pretty damn impressive mullet!” he added. Probst’s long hair goes along with his “Survivor Guy” persona, too. Probst noted he gets into this persona prior to daily challenges. “Weirdly, he looked a lot like me, only significantly cooler,” Probst explained to Entertainment Weekly regarding “Survivor Guy.” “He wore animal skins, had much longer hair, a lot of odd tattoos and a feather necklace. I’ll never forget his first words to me: “Jeff, I am Survivor Guy … I am your alter ego, and if you embrace what I have to offer I can make your life on Survivor better than ever.” When is ‘Survivor’ Season 42? Jeff Probst | Robert Voets/CBS via Getty Images While Survivor Season 41 feels as if it’s just begun, when is Survivor Season 42? According to Premiere Date, fans can expect season 42 to premiere on CBS in Spring 2022. Initial reports regarding the 42nd season noted production experienced delays. In April 2021, Fiji reportedly suspended international passenger flights. This allegedly affected the filming for season 42. It seems production was able to make up for any delays, though — and that could be, in part, due to the new 26-day gameplay. According to Jeff Probst, the show will continue with its new format changes for the foreseeable future. Hopefully, fans can continue to embrace the change. Check out Showbiz Cheat Sheet on Facebook!

Credit: WMOBy Claudia Sadoff and Joachim von BraunWASHINGTON DC, Oct 25 2021 (IPS) The global food system is facing more demands from society than ever before in modern times – and rightly so. From responding to the climate crisis to dealing with rising malnutrition and ensuring the sustainable use of natural resources and protection of biodiversity, the responsibility of our food systems is no longer just to “feed the world.” The recent action agenda released by the UN Secretary General at the Food Systems Summit not only highlighted this urgency but reminded us that our food systems are also one of our greatest hopes for making progress on these fronts. While the US$10 billion pledged by the United States to end hunger and malnutrition is a welcome start, our food systems have been forced to cope with an increasingly complex, interconnected set of challenges for too long – often without a corresponding shift in focus from governments and other key players. The changes required also need sufficient funding for food systems transformation, estimated to be in the range of $400 billion per year. This goal is within reach and is roughly comparable to three times New York City’s annual budget or less than 0.5 percent of world GDP in 2020. Food systems transformation also requires impactful innovations, so particular importance in this funding should therefore be placed on investment in research and innovation. Increased and sustained funding for research and innovation is crucial, as the world requires technological, policy and institutional innovation to address the increasingly complex set of challenges that are facing, and threatening, food, land and water systems in a climate crisis. Investments in agricultural research and innovation generate significant returns. Benefit-cost ratios of CGIAR research, for example, have shown consistent returns on investments to the order of 10:1. Despite this, international agricultural research remains underfunded, threatening food, economic, and environmental security around the world, whilst hunger and poverty continue to rise. In addition to securing funding for research and innovation, research itself must evolve to address the growing challenges around the world. In particular, research efforts should favour more circular business models that are driven by value, rather than volume, and those that promote resilience to shocks and balance with nature over more environmentally damaging models. We must also ensure that more research translates into concrete innovations that truly advance food systems transformation. While we desperately need technological innovations to increase productivity, reduce poverty, hunger and malnutrition, as well as climate proofing our food systems and making them more equitable, such innovations can only be taken forward if they are bundled with appropriate national policies, institutional changes and global actions, and strategies to deal with shocks and conflict. Sometimes the implementation of innovations inevitably involves trade-offs, not only synergies. Research and innovation efforts will be crucial to understanding and managing such trade-offs, as well as to help ensure that interconnected challenges are tackled in the most efficient and holistic way. To both achieve and maximize the potential of research and innovation, governments of the world should consider allocating just one per cent of the portion of their national GDP that relates to food systems, towards research and innovation. At present, many countries, including many of the world’s richest, only spend half of this. For the least developed countries, aid will be needed to reach such a level, potentially through a special trust fund backed by the International Monetary Fund’s Special Drawing Rights (SDRs). Such a fund, when properly backed by developed countries, would help to support greater scientific capacity on the ground in low- and middle-income countries, which will be needed if we are to address the challenges facing the whole world, not just the developed world. Today’s agri-food systems no longer simply feed people. They must also provide nutrition, promote livelihoods, protect the environment, and tackle climate change – often all at once. Financing and unlocking innovations are needed to address these challenges together. If our food, land and water systems are ever able to achieve society’s mounting demands, we must ensure our priorities are in order and begin to properly finance them. Ultimately, all of the ambition generated around the UN Food Systems Summit will fall short if we fail to finance the new research and innovation we know we need.

‘Curb Your Enthusiasm’: Larry David’s Biggest Annoyance in Premiere Was This Aspect of COVID-19,https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/curb-your-enthusiasm-larry-davids-biggest-annoyance-in-premiere-was-this-aspect-of-covid-19.html/,"['comedy', 'HBO', 'HBO Max']",['Whitney Danhauer'],,'Curb Your Enthusiasm' Season 11 shows us all that even though Larry David may have reveled in a pandemic lockdown there was something else that he found much more offensive.,"Curb Your Enthusiasm premiered on HBO Sunday, Oct. 24, and fans of the show were ready. We haven’t seen our favorite characters in the world of Larry David, who plays himself, since March of 2020. Honestly, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic seems like something Larry has a lot of opinions about. Surprisingly, the show didn’t go the route most people were expecting. [SPOILER ALERT: This article contains spoilers about the premiere episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm Season 11.] Larry David | Photograph by John P. Johnson/ HBO Larry David mainly was annoyed with the ‘COVID hoarders’ in the ‘Curb Your Enthusiasm’ premiere The premiere episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm Season 11 opens up with Larry finding a dead body floating in his pool. After conversing with the police, it turns out that Larry’s fence isn’t up to code. He could actually be liable for the death of the person robbing his house. However, while fans may have thought this would be the show’s focus, the episode managed to intertwine several plots into the premiere. At a meeting, Larry offers a colleague some Purell. He quickly makes it clear that he’s not one of those “COVID hoarders.” He’s talking about the people who bought large amounts of hand sanitizer and toilet paper at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic and caused a shortage in several areas.  Later in the episode, Larry discovers one of his good friends, Albert Brooks, is a “COVID hoarder.” He announces it to the huge crowd of people gathered at Albert’s house. Like a mob with pitchforks, the group turned on him. The rest of the scene plays out as Larry smugly shrugs from the bottom of the stairs, and Albert screams out, “Come back! I have flu shots!” No one saunters back into our lives quite like Lawrence Gene David. pic.twitter.com/NndmQho00n— HBO (@HBO) October 24, 2021 RELATED: ‘Curb Your Enthusiasm’: Is Leon Larry David’s Imaginary Friend? J.B. Smoove Weighs In On Their Relationship ‘Curb Your Enthusiasm’ cashes in on the tiniest nuances that irritate most people If finding awkward situations as humorous isn’t your thing, there’s a good chance you aren’t a fan of Larry David and Curb Your Enthusiasm. However, it’s the reality of his irritation that draws most people in. Whether we want to admit it or not, we all get annoyed by situations similar to the ones Larry experiences in the series. From someone holding up a line at the local ice cream parlor by trying too many samples to becoming annoyed with a friend for holding a “live funeral” so he can hear all the good things people would say about him before he dies – these are all moments, many of us would inwardly groan at. The difference between Larry and most of us is that Larry has no issues pointing these out. Sure, he can come across as a jerk. However, most of the time, there’s a little tapping in the back of your brain that makes you realize, “Well, yeah, he kind of has a point…” RELATED: ‘Curb Your Enthusiasm’: How Bob Einstein’s Marty Funkhouser Stayed a Part of the Show in Season 10 Larry David’s disdain for people plays out in the most delightful way One would think that Larry would revel in a pandemic lockdown with his hatred of people and all, but the premiere episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm Season 11 doesn’t mention it. To be fair, in the trailer for this season, we hear him tell someone, “I hate people individually, but I love mankind.” He may be a little cranky, he may be narcissistic, but he’s definitely the funniest person on TV right now.

SYDNEY, Oct 25 — Australian officials plan to roll out Covid-19 booster shots soon to prevent a resurgence of cases, as residents in the two largest cities of Sydney and Melbourne begin to enjoy more freedoms after months-long curbs.Australia has ditched its Covid-zero strategy in favour of suppressing the coronavirus, after largely stamping out infections for most of this year, and is now aiming to live with the virus through higher vaccinations.Officials are gradually shifting their focus to booster shots as double-dose vaccinations levels in Australia’s adult population nears 75 per cent. Almost 87 per cent of people above 16 have received their first dose since the national rollout began in February.“We think what is going to happen is that a booster shot will be made available from six months from your second dose,” Lieutenant General John Frewen, head of the vaccination taskforce, told the Australian Broadcasting Corp on Monday.Advice from the country’s immunisation advisory group on booster shots “is imminent”, he said, adding health workers, and staff and residents in aged care and disability centres would be offered the doses in the initial phase.Amid a surge in vaccinations, Victoria on Monday logged its lowest rise in daily infections in nearly three weeks at 1,461, while cases dipped for the fourth straight day in neighbouring New South Wales (NSW) to 294.Officials in Victoria are looking to ease more restrictions on gatherings and movement on Friday, just a week after Melbourne, the state capital, exited its sixth lockdown during the pandemic. Sydney lifted its lockdown two weeks ago.Double-dose vaccination rates in Victoria’s adult population will top 80 per cent by then — a level where masks will not be mandatory outdoors and people free to travel throughout the state.That rate neared 85 per cent in NSW, home to Sydney, with the state tipped to hit 90 per cent next week. The next set of restrictions will be eased on Dec. 1, when the lockdown rules will lift for the unvaccinated, according to the state’s reopening plan. — Reuters",2021-10-25 00:56:41,,,malaymail,[]

Labour have joined health groups this morning in calling for measures like compulsory mask-wearing in public, vaccine passports and working from home to be brought in. Cases are rising sharply and topped 50,000 a day for the first time in three months this week, with the health secretary warning that rate could yet double. After a week of similar comments from other ministers, chancellor Rishi Sunak reiterated Plan B won’t be introduced yet without ruling it out entirely. He told the BBC: ‘At the moment the data does not suggest we should immediately be moving to Plan B.’ Mr Sunak added: ‘Well the prime minister actually just said that we’re looking at the data all the time, as you would expect us too.  ‘We’re monitoring everything, but at the moment the data does not suggest that we should be immediately moving to Plan B, but of course we will keep an eye on that and the plans are ready.’ But behind the scenes, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is making preparations to enact the measures, according to The Guardian. Rishi Sunak is the latest high profile minister to rule out an immediate move to Plan B measures (Picture: PA) A leaked memo obtained by the paper reveals the public health body has been approaching local authorities to canvas opinion on the ‘immediate rollout of the winter plan’. Council bosses were asked to respond within hours and were told ‘this is a tight turnaround’, suggesting health officials feel it may not be long until the cabinet moves. A UKHSA spokesperson declined to comment on the leak but a government spokesperson told The Guardian ‘we are monitoring all the data closely’. Senior Labour figures have avoided taking a concrete position on the introduction of Plan B this week but shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves confirmed the party is in favour of more restrictions. Asked directly whether Plan B should be introduced now by Andrew Marr, she said: ‘Yes, but let’s not let the government off the hook with Plan A either.’ Professor Adam Finn, who is on the Joint Committee of Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), said Covid-19 hospital admissions and deaths are rising, and warned against complacency in what he said is a ‘worsening’ situation. Vaccine passports for nightclubs could be among the measures introduced this winter if cases continue to increase (Picture: pictureexclusive.com) He told Sky the ‘wrong message’ is being sent out to the public and called for ‘some iind of Plan B’. ‘The scientist added: ‘And I worry in fact that the vaccine programme itself is suffering as a consequence of this suggestion that somehow the problem’s gone and we can all go back to normal again, because that will increasingly make people jump to the conclusion that if they’ve not been vaccinated there’s no real need to do it. ‘So I do think we need to see a very different kind of message coming from the Government now that there is a serious problem, and we all need to continue to contribute to reducing transmission, so that we can get through the winter and the NHS can stay afloat and absolutely we can avoid lockdowns, and the disasters that those bring. ‘We all want to avoid that, but we can’t avoid it if we all just go back to normal now.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.

Cases are rising sharply and topped 50,000 a day for the first time in three months this week , with the health secretary warning that rate could yet double. After a week of similar comments from other ministers, chancellor Rishi Sunak reiterated Plan B won’t be introduced yet without ruling it out entirely. He told the BBC: ‘At the moment the data does not suggest we should immediately be moving to Plan B.’ Mr Sunak added: ‘Well the prime minister actually just said that we’re looking at the data all the time, as you would expect us too. ‘We’re monitoring everything, but at the moment the data does not suggest that we should be immediately moving to Plan B, but of course we will keep an eye on that and the plans are ready.’ But behind the scenes, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is making preparations to enact the measures, according to The Guardian . A leaked memo obtained by the paper reveals the public health body has been approaching local authorities to canvas opinion on the ‘immediate rollout of the winter plan’. Council bosses were asked to respond within hours and were told ‘this is a tight turnaround’, suggesting health officials feel it may not be long until the cabinet moves. A UKHSA spokesperson declined to comment on the leak but a government spokesperson told The Guardian ‘we are monitoring all the data closely’. Senior Labour figures have avoided taking a concrete position on the introduction of Plan B this week but shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves confirmed the party is in favour of more restrictions. Asked directly whether Plan B should be introduced now by Andrew Marr, she said: ‘Yes, but let’s not let the government off the hook with Plan A either.’ Professor Adam Finn, who is on the Joint Committee of Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), said Covid-19 hospital admissions and deaths are rising, and warned against complacency in what he said is a ‘worsening’ situation. He told Sky the ‘wrong message’ is being sent out to the public and called for ‘some iind of Plan B’. ‘The scientist added: ‘And I worry in fact that the vaccine programme itself is suffering as a consequence of this suggestion that somehow the problem’s gone and we can all go back to normal again, because that will increasingly make people jump to the conclusion that if they’ve not been vaccinated there’s no real need to do it. ‘So I do think we need to see a very different kind of message coming from the Government now that there is a serious problem, and we all need to continue to contribute to reducing transmission, so that we can get through the winter and the NHS can stay afloat and absolutely we can avoid lockdowns, and the disasters that those bring. ‘We all want to avoid that, but we can’t avoid it if we all just go back to normal now.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk .

She recognizes the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, but said she also understands her son is at a much lower risk for serious illness than older adults. “To me it’s not a clear benefit,” she said. Read more: ‘No middle ground’: How children’s COVID-19 vaccination is polarizing parents While many parents were overjoyed at the news that Health Canada is considering approval of the first COVID-19 vaccine for kids age five to 11 in Canada, parents like Hubert are feeling more trepidatious, and public health officials said they are going to have a much more nuanced conversation with parents about vaccination than they did with adults. Story continues below advertisement While 82 per cent of eligible Canadians aged 12 and up are already fully vaccinated, a recent survey by Angus Reid shows only 51 per cent of parents plan to immediately vaccinate their kids when a pediatric dose becomes available. Of parents with children in the five to 11 year age range, 23 per cent said they would never give their kids a COVID-19 vaccine, 18 per cent said they would wait, and nine per cent said they weren’t sure, according to the survey of 5,011 Canadians between Sept. 29 and Oct. 3, which cannot be assigned a margin of error because online surveys are not considered random samples. “Most of the research that I’ve seen sort of indicates that parents are more hesitant to vaccinate their kids against COVID than themselves,” said Kate Allen, a post-doctoral fellow at the Center for Vaccine Preventable Diseases of the University of Toronto. 2:18 Pfizer asks Health Canada to approve vaccine for kids aged 5 to 11 Pfizer asks Health Canada to approve vaccine for kids aged 5 to 11 There are several reasons parents might pause, she said. Story continues below advertisement It’s true that children are at a much lower risk of serious outcomes associated with COVID-19, and there have been very rare incidents of mRNA vaccines like Pfizer or Moderna linked to cases of myocarditis, a swelling of the heart muscle. As of Oct. 1, Health Canada has documented 859 cases associated with the vaccines, which mainly seem to affect people under 40 years old, and people who’ve developed the complication have typically been fine. “I know it’s rare, I know it’s not deadly, but I also see the risk of severe symptoms from COVID as being rare and not deadly for Jackson,” Hubert said when asked about weighing up the risks and benefits of the vaccine.

They say parents should consider the less tangible benefits of vaccination as well. “It’s less of a conversation about a direct benefit to them, and more of a community benefit,” Allen said. The pandemic has taken a heavy toll on children, depriving them of school, time with their peers, extracurriculars _ and their mental health has suffered as a result, said Dr. Vinita Dubey, associate medical officer of health with Toronto Public Health. Story continues below advertisement “Not one child has been spared from this pandemic. I mean every single child has had to bear a sacrifice because of the pandemic in one way or the other,” Dubey said. 2:04 Half of Canadian parents with children aged 5-11 want them to be fully vaccinated Half of Canadian parents with children aged 5-11 want them to be fully vaccinated So far Pfizer-BioNtech is the only manufacturer to request approval for its pediatric COVID-19 vaccine and Health Canada is still reviewing the data. The regulator has promised the review will be thorough, and the vaccine will only be approved for children if the benefits outweigh the potential risks. Policy-makers know they’re going to have to take parents’ concerns seriously as well. On a recent tour of the Childrens’ Hospital of Eastern Ontario in Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with Dr. Anne Pham-Huy, a pediatric infectious diseases physician. Story continues below advertisement “Vaccine confidence is going to be the most important part of it this time around,” Pham-Huy said, to which Trudeau agreed.

Her research focused on the role of family doctors, but she said during the pandemic anyone can be that trusted sounding board. “It could be a faith leader, it could be an important family member or friend, someone who you trust, to help guide you to the right sources to make that decision,” she said.

The public health experts agree, the debate around vaccines has become polarized and open conversations will be the key to addressing parents’ concerns. “I think one thing to say to parents is you don’t have to make your decision right away,” Dubey said. “I mean for those who are ready to make their decision, but it’s fine but if you have questions, seek the answers.” Her only advice is to get those answers from a trusted source, and not social media.

AUSTIN, Oct 25 — Lewis Hamilton had to settle for second but Formula One’s most successful driver said yesterday’s US Grand Prix in Austin still felt like a breakthrough for his sport.The race day crowd of 140,000 at the Circuit of the Americas surpassed the 135,000 who attended the Indianapolis 500 in May, then the largest sporting event in America since the start of the pandemic.The three-day crowd figure for the race in Texas was given as 400,000.“It feels like this is our acceptance into the US,” Hamilton, a five-times winner in Austin, said as he surveyed the scenes after the race.“I hope we get more races out here and I hope that the sport continues to grow because you can tell just how great the fans are out here.”There was no race in Austin last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic but Formula One will have two US rounds next year, with Miami making its debut.There has also been talk of further expansion, with Las Vegas seen as the most likely candidate.While there are no US drivers, the sport has been owned since 2017 by US-based Liberty Media who have targeted America as a key growth area.The sport struggled to make inroads in the past, particularly after an infamous six car race at Indianapolis in 2005 left huge reputational damage.The Texas weekend offered plenty of evidence of Formula One’s growing popularity, with many crediting the Netflix Drive to Survive documentary series, now filming season four.“I think Netflix has been outstanding for Formula One. It’s driven a younger fan base, it’s driven a much larger fan base. It’s really had an impact in America,” said McLaren’s American boss Zak Brown.“I think it’s doing what we as a sport would like it to do, which is turn on a bunch of new fans. I think it’s been hugely successful.”Hamilton’s Mercedes boss Toto Wolff agreed.“We were not keen at the beginning of Netflix because we wanted to concentrate on on-track performance and I was wrong. It’s clearly a big success,” he said.“Everywhere in the world it was the number one documentary on Netflix for quite a while and it’s become part of Formula One and you can clearly see it’s beneficial... the feedback that we get from fans is tremendous, especially here in the US”The attendance may also have been boosted by the lack of a race last year and the pandemic effect, with bottled-up demand for mass gatherings.The tense and thrilling battle between seven-times world champion Hamilton and Red Bull’s Sunday race winner and overall leader Max Verstappen has drawn new fans as well.Mexican Sergio Perez’s move to Red Bull this season as a race winner in a competitive car was another significant factor for fans from the region. — Reuters",2021-10-25 14:38:40,,,malaymail,"[('Sergio Perez’s', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY')]"

What does Hough have up his sleeve that sparked such interest from Dancing with the Stars viewers? Derek Hough on the set of “Dancing with the Stars” season 30. | ABC/Christopher Willard Derek Hough sits on the ‘DWTS’ judging panel After years of being judged by Carrie Ann Inaba, Len Goodman, and Bruno Tonioli, Hough can now call them his contemporaries. In 2020 he returned to the show after an absence of four years. Hough announced in 2016 that he would leave the Dancing with the Stars ballroom floor behind. However, he did not leave the world of television behind, appearing as a judge on NBC’s World of Dance.  With great surprise and delight, Hough returned to the series that made him a household name to fill in for head judge Len Goodman. The 2020 season of DWTS filmed under tight coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions. Therefore, Goodman was unable to travel from his London home to the show’s LA location.

One of these admirers was fellow judge Inaba who wrote, “It’s about time. I love when you dance, Derek! We all do! I can’t wait to see what magic you are bringing on Monday. And this suit! So good.” Hough’s fans echoed her sentiments. “Derek brightens my Mondays when he dances! I do miss him and his partners competing every week.

More posts by this contributor From startups to Starbucks: The embedded API opportunity How retailers can survive the Amazon era The quest to provide more affordable and accessible healthcare, magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic, has spurred an explosion of innovation, which in turn has attracted massive amounts of capital. To put this into perspective, consider this: In 2019, digital health saw $7.7 billion in VC investment, and that number rose to $14.6 billion in 2020. However, the first half of 2021 alone saw $14.7 billion in VC investment. Its marriage with fintech is the catalyst for the transformation of the healthcare industry. Similar to the unbundling of financial services and how fintech is scaling vertical SaaS, the pandemic-fueled disaggregation of healthcare has created new players that are taking a page out of the fintech revolution book — all starting with payments. A growing number of startups are now leveraging the fintech playbook to solve a key part of the healthcare problem — the shifting dynamics between patients, payers and providers, and how payments and related electronic health records (EHRs) flow between them. Not only is the onus of payments and data flow moving from payers to patients, but providers are now facing a monumental shift to new billing and engagement models, requiring new technologies and platforms to help with the change. Through the lens of fintech, here are three key areas to watch in healthcare. Gamifying consumer wellness to stave off chronic illnesses One of the largest trends impacting the population today is the steady rise of chronic illnesses. It is estimated that nearly half the U.S. population will have a chronic illness by 2025. People are getting sicker for longer periods of time, which leads to a constant spending streak. Patients not adhering to medical guidance is a major factor and is responsible for $100 billion of healthcare spending and over 100,000 deaths annually. With around a fifth of patients never filling their prescriptions, it has become a priority to educate and incentivize patients to complete care and avoid readmissions or ER visits. The convergence of health and fintech will be an important catalyst to address some of the most pressing issues facing healthcare today. To curb the rise of chronic illnesses and the associated recurring costs, many startups are using behavioral economics and gamification to incentivize patients and build healthy habits. For example, companies like Paceline in the U.S., Sweatcoin in Europe and Betterfly in Latin America gamify wellness by combining fitness and financial rewards. On the other hand, startups like Sempre Health and Wellth are tackling medical non-adherence with behavioral economics. For example, Wellth financially rewards actions like on-time prescription intake or regular A1c tests for diabetic patients. Fintech for affordability and reducing friction Looking at payers, there’s a major shift stemming from the rise of high-deductible healthcare plans (HDHP) — enrollment has risen 43% in the last five years — emphasizing an increase in premiums and patient financial responsibility.

Though the actors have played a couple all throughout season two, the new filming experience provided a host of challenges, with its sex scenes becoming a problem in particular. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, Victoria revealed that filming intimate scenes with each other was difficult initially in terms of their safety. “This is not a show where you can be like, ‘nobody’s going to kiss, it’ll be fine’, so it took months to figure out how to do it safely,” she told Entertainment Weekly.  “I felt very lucky that they start off their relationship at odds with each other, navigating the awkwardness of being new parents, because it felt strange to be physically intimate very early on – even though we’re supposed to be a married couple.” Fortunately, Victoria said she and Penn began to feel more comfortable as time went on.  Most read in Showbiz 'eyes opened' Strictly's Giovanni Pernice breaks silence on Maura Higgins split 'SHOCK & HEARTACHE' Alec Baldwin's wife breaks silence days after accidental shooting horror assault Damien Dempsey reveals he feared he'd die after Dublin chip shop attack HAPPY FAMILY Hazel O'Sullivan praises footie partner Andros Townsend for being hands-on-dad INSTA VS REALITY Stacey Solomon reveals secret drama behind picture-perfect Halloween snap GIO ON DATE APP Strictly's Giovanni was secretly on dating app behind Maura Higgins' back “It’s weird.

(AP Photo/Anupam Nath) | ASSOCIATED PRESS The mortality caused by a deadly pathogen is partly a reflection of the social and political order it attacks Never in our lifetimes, it seems, has there been greater uncertainty about the future — and greater ignorance of the past. At the beginning of 2020, very few people grasped the significance of the news coming out of Wuhan about a new coronavirus. When I first spoke and wrote publicly about the rising probability of a global pandemic, in the week ending Jan. 26, 2020, I was regarded as eccentric (certainly by the majority of the delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos, who seemed oblivious to the danger). The conventional wisdom at that time, from Fox News to The Washington Post, was that the coronavirus posed a lesser threat to Americans than the usual winter wave of influenza. On Feb. 2, I wrote, “We are now dealing with an epidemic in the world’s most populous country, which has a significant chance of becoming a global pandemic. ... The challenge is ... to resist that strange fatalism that leads most of us not to cancel our travel plans and not to wear uncomfortable masks, even when a dangerous virus is spreading exponentially.” Looking back, I read those sentences as a veiled confession. I was traveling manically in January and February, as I had done for most of the previous 20 years. In January, I flew from London to Dallas, from Dallas to San Francisco, and from there to Hong Kong (Jan. 8), Taipei (Jan. 10), Singapore (Jan. 13), Zurich (Jan. 19), back to San Francisco (Jan. 24), and then to Fort Lauderdale (Jan. 27). I wore a mask once or twice but found it intolerable after an hour and took it off. In the course of February, I flew almost as frequently, though not so far: to New York, Sun Valley, Bozeman, Washington and Lyford Cay in the Bahamas. You may wonder what kind of life that was. I used to joke that the lecture circuit had turned me into an “international man of history.” I realized only later that I might have been one of the “superspreaders” whose hyperactive travel schedules were spreading the virus from Asia to the rest of the world. My weekly newspaper column in the first half of 2020 became a kind of plague diary, though I never mentioned the fact that I was ill for most of February, with a painful cough I could not shake off. (To get through lectures, I relied heavily on the alternative medicine that some call Scotch.) “Worry about grandparents,” I wrote on Feb. 29; “the mortality rate for people in their eighties is above 14%, whereas it’s close to zero for those under 40.” I omitted the less comforting data on asthmatic men in their mid-50s. I also left out the fact that I went to see a doctor twice only to be told that — as more or less everywhere in the United States at that time — there were no tests available for COVID-19. All I knew was that it was serious, and not only for me and my family. As I wrote on March 1: “Those who blithely say, ‘This is no worse than the flu’ ... are missing the point. ... Uncertainty surrounds it because it is so difficult to detect in its early stages, when many carriers are both infectious and asymptomatic. We don’t know for sure how many people have it, so we don’t exactly know its reproduction number and its mortality rate. There’s no vaccine and there’s no cure.” In another article, published in The Wall Street Journal on March 8, I wrote, “If the U.S. turns out to have proportionately as many cases as South Korea, it will soon have some 46,000 cases and more than 300 deaths — or 1,200 deaths if the U.S. mortality rate is as high as Italy’s.” At that point, total confirmed cases in the U.S. stood at just 541; deaths at 22. We passed 46,000 cases on March 24 and 1,200 deaths on March 25, just over two weeks later. On March 15, I noted, “John F. Kennedy airport was thronged yesterday with people doing what, since time immemorial, they have done in times of plague: fleeing the big city (and spreading the virus). ... We are entering the panic phase of the pandemic.” That was the same day I myself flew, with my wife and my two youngest children, from California to Montana. We stayed there for a year. I wrote and thought about little else in the first half of 2020. Why this intense preoccupation? The answer is that, although my core competency is financial history, I have been keenly interested in the role of disease in history ever since studying the Hamburg cholera epidemic of 1892 as a graduate student more than 30 years ago. Richard Evans’ meticulously detailed study of that episode introduced me to the idea that the mortality caused by a deadly pathogen is partly a reflection of the social and political order it attacks. It was the class structure as much as the bacterium Vibrio cholerae that killed people in Hamburg, Germany, Evans argued, because the entrenched power of the city’s property owners had been an insuperable obstacle to improving the city’s antiquated water and sewage systems. The mortality rate for the poor was 13 times higher than for the rich. Researching “The Pity of War” a few years later, I was struck by statistics that suggested the German army had collapsed in 1918 partly because of a surge of illness, possibly resulting from the Spanish influenza pandemic. “The War of the World” (Penguin, 2006) delved more deeply into the history of the 1918-19 pandemic, showing how the First World War ended with twin pandemics — not only influenza but also the ideological contagion of Bolshevism. The work I did on empires in the 2000s also involved excursions into the history of contagious disease. No account of European settlement in the New World could have omitted the role that disease played in “thinning the Indians, to make room for the English,” as John Archdale, the governor of Carolina in the 1690s, callously remarked. (The title of the second chapter of my book “Empire” was “White Plague.”) I was also very struck by the terrible toll of tropical disease on British soldiers stationed far from home: A man’s chances of surviving a tour of duty in Sierra Leone were pitifully low — 1 in 2. “The Great Degeneration” (Penguin, 2014) explicitly warned of our growing vulnerability to “the ... random mutation of viruses like influenza,” while “The Square and the Tower” (Penguin, 2017) was essentially a history of the world based on the insight that “network structures are as important as viruses in determining the speed and extent of a contagion.” The COVID-19 pandemic is far from over. The death toll worldwide approaches five million, which is certainly an underestimate, as the statistics from a number of large countries (notably Iran and Russia) cannot be trusted. And the cumulative body count continues to rise globally — to say nothing of the number of people whose health has been permanently damaged, which no one has yet estimated. It seems increasingly likely that Lord Martin Rees, Britain’s astronomer royal, has won his bet with the Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker that “bioterror or bioerror will lead to one million casualties in a single event within a six month period starting no later than Dec 31 2020.” Some epidemiologists have argued that, without drastic social distancing and economic lockdowns, the ultimate death toll could have been between 30 million and 40 million. Because of government restrictions and changes in public behavior, it will surely not be as high. ASSOCIATED PRESS Cemetery workers lower the coffin of a COVID-19 victim into his grave at the Vila Formosa cemetery in Sao Paulo, Brazil, late Wednesday, March 31, 2021. Because of the increased number of deaths in the city, the burial service in some public cemeteries has been extended to the hours of the night. (AP Photo/Nelson Antoine) Yet precisely these “nonpharmaceutical interventions” have inflicted a shock on the world economy far greater than that caused by the 2008-09 financial crisis — potentially as great as the shock of the Great Depression, but compressed into months, not years. Governments had to take drastic fiscal measures to stave off a collapse of the markets. You see, disasters and their impact are rarely entirely exogenous events, with the exception of a massive meteor strike, which hasn’t happened in 66 million years, or an alien invasion, which hasn’t happened at all. Even a catastrophic earthquake is only as catastrophic as the extent of urbanization along the fault line — or the shoreline, if it triggers a tsunami. A pandemic is made up of a new pathogen and the social networks that it attacks. We cannot understand the scale of the contagion by studying only the virus itself, because the virus will infect only as many people as social networks allow it to. At the same time, a catastrophe lays bare the societies and states that it strikes. It is a moment of truth, of revelation, exposing some as fragile, others as resilient, and others as “antifragile” — able not just to withstand disaster but to be strengthened by it. We still find ourselves in the middle of this pandemic, about which it’s hard to gain the perspective that hindsight affords. But looking at past pandemics and disasters not only helps provide perspective on the current one, but also allow us to understand and prepare for the inevitability of the next one. So cometh now My Lady Influenza, like a star Inebriously wan, and in her train Fever, the haggard soul’s white nenuphur, And lily-fingered Death, and grisly Pain And Constipation who makes all things vain, Pneumonyer, Cancer, and Nasal Catarrh. Rupert Brooke’s “To My Lady Influenza” (1906) was a facetious undergraduate work. Yet “Lady Influenza” was never to be trifled with. The first well-described influenza outbreaks were in 16th-century Europe, but the earliest was probably in 1173. There had been significant influenza pandemics in the 18th and 19th centuries, but the 20th century was to be hit much harder. A more populous world was also a more urban world and a more mobile world — a world in which low air quality in industrial towns may have made people more susceptible to respiratory illnesses. A year after Brooke wrote “To My Lady Influenza,” his eldest brother, Dick, died of pneumonia at the age of 26. Brooke himself would live only a year longer, dying of an infected mosquito bite that led to sepsis, off the Greek island of Skyros. A predictable “gray rhino,” in the sense that danger of a general European war was well known, but also a surprising “black swan,” in the sense that contemporaries seemed bewildered by its outbreak, the First World War was a true dragon-king event in terms of its vast historical consequences. As disastrous as the war was, its proximate impact in terms of lives lost was exceeded by that of the influenza pandemic that broke out in its final year. Where exactly the new strain of H1N1 first appeared is uncertain, but it is usually said to have been Fort Riley, Kansas, the site of Camp Funston, one of the network of Army camps where hundreds of thousands of young American men were being trained to fight in Europe as the American Expeditionary Forces. There is, however, evidence that the pandemic originated in the British Army in 1917, though the condition was initially identified as “purulent bronchitis with bronchopneumonia.” Here was the key to influenza’s 20th-century success. Never had armies been mobilized on such a scale before — more than 70 million men in uniform. Never had so many young men been taken from their homes and workplaces, crowded into primitive accommodations, and sent over long distances in ships and trains. The idea that the virus originated in pigs has been refuted (an avian origin seems more likely); if anything, the direction of infection was from men to pigs. The first American cases were recorded at Camp Funston on March 4. A week later, a member of Fort Riley’s catering staff entered the infirmary, followed in the coming days by a stream of infected soldiers. By the end of the month, more than a thousand cases had been recorded and 48 men had died of influenza. As if to mock the efforts of men to kill one another, the virus spread rapidly across the United States and then crossed to Europe on the jam-packed American troopships. It is possible that the pandemic explains the near doubling of the proportion of German soldiers reporting sick in the summer of 1918, which was a crucial factor in the imperial army’s subsequent collapse. Certainly, we have reports of German prisoners of war with the flu from July. By that time it had reached India, Australia and New Zealand. A few months later, a second and deadlier wave struck all but simultaneously in Brest, France; Freetown, Sierra Leone; and Boston. The virus made a new landfall in the United States at Boston’s Commonwealth Pier on Aug. 27, 1918, when three cases of influenza appeared on the sick list. Eight cases emerged the next day, and 58 the next, 15 of whom were so ill they were transferred to the U.S. Naval Hospital in Chelsea. On Sept. 8, influenza arrived at the Army’s Camp Devens. Within 10 days, thousands of feverish patients overwhelmed the camp’s hospitals; within weeks, the morgue was full of blue-tinged, asphyxiated corpses. Combatant countries sought to suppress the news of the pandemic as potentially harmful to wartime morale; this hardly helped to keep the public informed. The disease came to be known as the Spanish flu because only the largely uncensored press of neutral Spain reported on it with any accuracy. Between 40 million and 50 million people died as a result of the pandemic, the majority of them suffocated by a lethal accumulation of blood and other fluid in the lungs. The absolute numbers were highest in India (18.5 million deaths) and China (between 4 million and 9.5 million), but death rates varied widely from place to place. Close to half (44.5%) of the population of Cameroon was wiped out; in Western Samoa, nearly a quarter (23.6%). The worst mortality rates in Europe were in Hungary and Spain (each around 1.2%), with Italy not far behind. By contrast, North America got off lightly: between 0.53% and 0.65% for the United States, 0.61% for Canada. As these figures imply, the Spanish flu was indifferent as to a country’s combatant status. While its initial spread may have been related to wartime accommodation and transportation, that soon ceased to be true. In the United States, the deaths of as many as 675,000 people were attributed to the Spanish flu, of which 550,000 were excess deaths (above what would have been expected in that period under normal circumstances). Equivalent mortality in 2020 would have been between 1.8 million and 2.2 million Americans. The Spanish flu killed an order of magnitude more Americans than died in combat in the war (53,402). Ironically, unlike most flu epidemics, but like the war that preceded and spread it, the influenza of 1918 disproportionately killed young adults. Out of 272,500 male influenza deaths in the United States, nearly 49% were aged 20 to 39, whereas only 18% were under five and 13% were over 50. The very young and very old were also (as usual) vulnerable, so that all countries for which age-specific death rates are available recorded a roughly W-shaped age distribution of mortality. Death was not caused by the influenza virus itself so much as by the body’s immunological reaction to the virus. Perversely, this meant that individuals with the strongest immune systems were more likely to die than those with weaker immune systems. A good illustration of the impact of the pandemic on young adults, as well as a vivid description of the hallucinogenic miseries of the illness itself, can be found in Katherine Anne Porter’s short story “Pale Horse, Pale Rider” (1937), about a wartime romance cut cruelly short by the virus. In Sept. 2021, COVID-19’s American death toll overtook that of the 1918 flu. And yet, in Aug. 2020, it appeared that, with a regime of mass testing, contact tracing, social distancing and targeted quarantining, a country could contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2, as the virus relied heavily on superspreaders for its transmission and disproportionately sickened or killed people past retirement age. Only in the spring of 2021 did it join the elite of pandemics — the 20 or so in recorded history that killed upward of 0.05% of humanity. Only a handful of those nations that fought World War II have lost more people per day to COVID-19 than they have lost to the Axis powers. The United States is one of those countries. This illustrates something profound — that all disasters are at some level man-made political disasters, even if they originate with new pathogens. Politics explained why World War II killed 25 times as many Germans as Americans. Politics also helps to explain why COVID-19 has thus far killed more than eight times as many Americans as Germans.

Coronavirus cases in India are surging faster than anywhere else in the world. (AP Photo/Anupam Nath) This plague began as a gray rhino, predicted by many. It struck as a black swan, somehow completely unforeseen. Could it become a world-changing “dragon king”? As we have seen, disasters of any kind become truly epoch-making events only if their economic, social and political ramifications amount to more than the excess mortality they cause. Could this medium-size disaster nevertheless alter our lives permanently and profoundly? Let me now hazard three guesses. First, COVID-19 will be to social life what AIDS was to sexual life: It will change our behavior, though by no means enough to avert a significant number of premature deaths. I myself welcome a new age of social distancing, but then I am a natural misanthrope who hates crowds and will not greatly miss hugs and handshakes. Most people, however, will be unable to resist the temptations of post-lockdown gregariousness. There will be unsafe socializing just as there still is unsafe sex, even after more than three decades and 30 million deaths from HIV. Second, and for that reason, most big cities are not “over.” Do we all now head from Gotham or the Great Wen to the villages, there to cultivate our vegetable gardens in splendid, rustic isolation? Do nearly half of us continue to work from home, as we did during the pandemic — more than three times more than before? Probably not. It takes a lot to kill a city. True, just over a century after Thomas Mann wrote “Death in Venice” (1912), Venice is pretty much dead. But it was not cholera that killed it — it was the shifting pattern of international trade. Likewise, COVID-19 will not kill London or New York; it will just make them cheaper, grungier and younger. Some billionaires will not return. Some firms and many families will move to the suburbs or even farther afield. Tax revenues will drop. Crime rates will jump. As Gerald Ford supposedly did in 1975, when the city asked for a federal bailout, another president may tell New York to “drop dead.” San Francisco will lose talent to Austin. But inertia is a powerful thing. Americans these days relocate less than they used to. Only a third of jobs can really be done at home; everyone else will still need to work in offices, shops and factories. Workplaces will just be different — more spacious and campus-like, as they already are in Silicon Valley. Commuting will no longer involve being packed like sardines on a subway. No more unwelcome intimacies on elevators. Masks over most faces. No more tut-tutting at the hijab and the niqab. Perforce, we are all modest now. What of the pandemic’s impact on the generational imbalances that had grown so intolerable in many societies by 2020? Was COVID-19 sent by Freya, the goddess of youth, to emancipate millennials and Generation Z from bearing the fiscal burden of an excessive number of elderly people? It is tempting to marvel at this ageist virus. No previous pandemic was so discriminating against the elderly and in favor of the young. But in truth, the impact of COVID-19 in terms of excess mortality will probably not be great enough to balance the intergenerational accounts. In the short run, the majority of old people will remain retired; relatively few will die prematurely — hardly any in the most elderly of countries, Japan. The young, meanwhile, will be the ones struggling to find jobs (other than with Amazon) and struggling almost as much to have fun. An economy without crowds is not a “new normal.” It may be more like the new anomie, to borrow Émile Durkheim’s term for the sense of disconnectedness he associated with modernity. For most young people, the word “fun” is almost synonymous with “crowd.” The era of distancing will be a time of depression in the psychological as well as the economic sense. The gloom has been especially deep for Generation Z, whose university social lives — half the point of college, if not more — were wrecked. They spent yet more time on electronic devices — perhaps an hour a day more than before the pandemic. It did not make them happier. History tells us to expect the great punctuation marks of disaster in no predictable order. The four horsemen of the Book of Revelation — Conquest, War, Famine and the pale rider Death — gallop out at seemingly random intervals to remind us that no amount of technological innovation can make mankind invulnerable. Indeed, some innovations — like those fleets of jet airplanes that transported so many infected people from Wuhan to the rest of the world in Jan. 2020 — give the horsemen the opportunity to ride in their slipstream. Yet somehow the riders’ arrival always takes us by surprise. For a moment, we contemplate the scenario of total extinction. We shelter in place, watching “Contagion” or reading Atwood. Perhaps the black swan becomes a dragon king and turns life upside down. But very rarely. Mostly, for the lucky many, life after the disaster goes on, changed in a few ways but on the whole remarkably, reassuringly, boringly the same. With astonishing speed, we put our brush with mortality behind us and blithely carry on, forgetful of those who were not so lucky, regardless of the next disaster that lies in wait. Think, if you doubt the truth of this, of Daniel Defoe’s concluding doggerel from his “Journal of the Plague Year”: A dreadful Plague in London was, In the Year Sixty Five, Which swept an Hundred Thousand Souls Away; yet I alive!

At the beginning of 2020, very few people grasped the significance of the news coming out of Wuhan about a new coronavirus. When I first spoke and wrote publicly about the rising probability of a global pandemic, in the week ending Jan. 26, 2020, I was regarded as eccentric (certainly by the majority of the delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos, who seemed oblivious to the danger). The conventional wisdom at that time, from Fox News to The Washington Post, was that the coronavirus posed a lesser threat to Americans than the usual winter wave of influenza. On Feb. 2, I wrote, “We are now dealing with an epidemic in the world’s most populous country, which has a significant chance of becoming a global pandemic. ... The challenge is ... to resist that strange fatalism that leads most of us not to cancel our travel plans and not to wear uncomfortable masks, even when a dangerous virus is spreading exponentially.” Looking back, I read those sentences as a veiled confession. Related Is there hope for the family after the pandemic? Or will the battle of the sexes rage on? The river is round I was traveling manically in January and February, as I had done for most of the previous 20 years. In January, I flew from London to Dallas, from Dallas to San Francisco, and from there to Hong Kong (Jan. 8), Taipei (Jan. 10), Singapore (Jan. 13), Zurich (Jan. 19), back to San Francisco (Jan. 24), and then to Fort Lauderdale (Jan. 27). I wore a mask once or twice but found it intolerable after an hour and took it off. In the course of February, I flew almost as frequently, though not so far: to New York, Sun Valley, Bozeman, Washington and Lyford Cay in the Bahamas. You may wonder what kind of life that was. I used to joke that the lecture circuit had turned me into an “international man of history.” I realized only later that I might have been one of the “superspreaders” whose hyperactive travel schedules were spreading the virus from Asia to the rest of the world. My weekly newspaper column in the first half of 2020 became a kind of plague diary, though I never mentioned the fact that I was ill for most of February, with a painful cough I could not shake off. (To get through lectures, I relied heavily on the alternative medicine that some call Scotch.) “Worry about grandparents,” I wrote on Feb. 29; “the mortality rate for people in their eighties is above 14%, whereas it’s close to zero for those under 40.” I omitted the less comforting data on asthmatic men in their mid-50s. I also left out the fact that I went to see a doctor twice only to be told that — as more or less everywhere in the United States at that time — there were no tests available for COVID-19. All I knew was that it was serious, and not only for me and my family. As I wrote on March 1: “Those who blithely say, ‘This is no worse than the flu’ ... are missing the point. ... Uncertainty surrounds it because it is so difficult to detect in its early stages, when many carriers are both infectious and asymptomatic. We don’t know for sure how many people have it, so we don’t exactly know its reproduction number and its mortality rate. There’s no vaccine and there’s no cure.” In another article, published in The Wall Street Journal on March 8, I wrote, “If the U.S. turns out to have proportionately as many cases as South Korea, it will soon have some 46,000 cases and more than 300 deaths — or 1,200 deaths if the U.S. mortality rate is as high as Italy’s.” At that point, total confirmed cases in the U.S. stood at just 541; deaths at 22. We passed 46,000 cases on March 24 and 1,200 deaths on March 25, just over two weeks later. On March 15, I noted, “John F. Kennedy airport was thronged yesterday with people doing what, since time immemorial, they have done in times of plague: fleeing the big city (and spreading the virus). ... We are entering the panic phase of the pandemic.” That was the same day I myself flew, with my wife and my two youngest children, from California to Montana. We stayed there for a year. I wrote and thought about little else in the first half of 2020. Why this intense preoccupation? The answer is that, although my core competency is financial history, I have been keenly interested in the role of disease in history ever since studying the Hamburg cholera epidemic of 1892 as a graduate student more than 30 years ago. Richard Evans’ meticulously detailed study of that episode introduced me to the idea that the mortality caused by a deadly pathogen is partly a reflection of the social and political order it attacks. It was the class structure as much as the bacterium Vibrio cholerae that killed people in Hamburg, Germany, Evans argued, because the entrenched power of the city’s property owners had been an insuperable obstacle to improving the city’s antiquated water and sewage systems. The mortality rate for the poor was 13 times higher than for the rich. Researching “The Pity of War” a few years later, I was struck by statistics that suggested the German army had collapsed in 1918 partly because of a surge of illness, possibly resulting from the Spanish influenza pandemic. “The War of the World” (Penguin, 2006) delved more deeply into the history of the 1918-19 pandemic, showing how the First World War ended with twin pandemics — not only influenza but also the ideological contagion of Bolshevism. The work I did on empires in the 2000s also involved excursions into the history of contagious disease. No account of European settlement in the New World could have omitted the role that disease played in “thinning the Indians , to make room for the English , ” as John Archdale, the governor of Carolina in the 1690s, callously remarked. (The title of the second chapter of my book “Empire” was “White Plague.”) I was also very struck by the terrible toll of tropical disease on British soldiers stationed far from home: A man’s chances of surviving a tour of duty in Sierra Leone were pitifully low — 1 in 2. “ The Great Degeneration” (Penguin, 2014) explicitly warned of our growing vulnerability to “the ... random mutation of viruses like influenza,” while “The Square and the Tower” (Penguin, 2017) was essentially a history of the world based on the insight that “network structures are as important as viruses in determining the speed and extent of a contagion.” The COVID-19 pandemic is far from over. The death toll worldwide approaches five million, which is certainly an underestimate, as the statistics from a number of large countries (notably Iran and Russia) cannot be trusted. And the cumulative body count continues to rise globally — to say nothing of the number of people whose health has been permanently damaged, which no one has yet estimated. It seems increasingly likely that Lord Martin Rees, Britain’s astronomer royal, has won his bet with the Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker that “bioterror or bioerror will lead to one million casualties in a single event within a six month period starting no later than Dec 31 2020.” Some epidemiologists have argued that, without drastic social distancing and economic lockdowns, the ultimate death toll could have been between 30 million and 40 million. Because of government restrictions and changes in public behavior, it will surely not be as high. Cemetery workers lower the coffin of a COVID-19 victim into his grave at the Vila Formosa cemetery in Sao Paulo, Brazil, late Wednesday, March 31, 2021. Because of the increased number of deaths in the city, the burial service in some public cemeteries has been extended to the hours of the night. (AP Photo/Nelson Antoine) ASSOCIATED PRESS Yet precisely these “nonpharmaceutical interventions” have inflicted a shock on the world economy far greater than that caused by the 2008-09 financial crisis — potentially as great as the shock of the Great Depression, but compressed into months, not years. Governments had to take drastic fiscal measures to stave off a collapse of the markets. You see, disasters and their impact are rarely entirely exogenous events, with the exception of a massive meteor strike, which hasn’t happened in 66 million years, or an alien invasion, which hasn’t happened at all. Even a catastrophic earthquake is only as catastrophic as the extent of urbanization along the fault line — or the shoreline, if it triggers a tsunami. A pandemic is made up of a new pathogen and the social networks that it attacks. We cannot understand the scale of the contagion by studying only the virus itself, because the virus will infect only as many people as social networks allow it to. At the same time, a catastrophe lays bare the societies and states that it strikes. It is a moment of truth, of revelation, exposing some as fragile, others as resilient, and others as “antifragile” — able not just to withstand disaster but to be strengthened by it. We still find ourselves in the middle of this pandemic, about which it’s hard to gain the perspective that hindsight affords. But looking at past pandemics and disasters not only helps provide perspective on the current one, but also allow us to understand and prepare for the inevitability of the next one. So cometh now My Lady Influenza, like a star Inebriously wan, and in her train Fever, the haggard soul’s white nenuphur, And lily-fingered Death, and grisly Pain And Constipation who makes all things vain, Pneumonyer, Cancer, and Nasal Catarrh. Rupert Brooke’s “To My Lady Influenza” (1906) was a facetious undergraduate work. Yet “Lady Influenza” was never to be trifled with. The first well-described influenza outbreaks were in 16th-century Europe, but the earliest was probably in 1173. There had been significant influenza pandemics in the 18th and 19th centuries, but the 20th century was to be hit much harder. A more populous world was also a more urban world and a more mobile world — a world in which low air quality in industrial towns may have made people more susceptible to respiratory illnesses. A year after Brooke wrote “To My Lady Influenza,” his eldest brother, Dick, died of pneumonia at the age of 26. Brooke himself would live only a year longer, dying of an infected mosquito bite that led to sepsis, off the Greek island of Skyros. A predictable “gray rhino,” in the sense that danger of a general European war was well known, but also a surprising “black swan,” in the sense that contemporaries seemed bewildered by its outbreak, the First World War was a true dragon-king event in terms of its vast historical consequences. As disastrous as the war was, its proximate impact in terms of lives lost was exceeded by that of the influenza pandemic that broke out in its final year. Where exactly the new strain of H1N1 first appeared is uncertain, but it is usually said to have been Fort Riley, Kansas, the site of Camp Funston, one of the network of Army camps where hundreds of thousands of young American men were being trained to fight in Europe as the American Expeditionary Forces. There is, however, evidence that the pandemic originated in the British Army in 1917, though the condition was initially identified as “purulent bronchitis with bronchopneumonia.” Here was the key to influenza’s 20th-century success. Never had armies been mobilized on such a scale before — more than 70 million men in uniform. Never had so many young men been taken from their homes and workplaces, crowded into primitive accommodations, and sent over long distances in ships and trains. The idea that the virus originated in pigs has been refuted (an avian origin seems more likely); if anything, the direction of infection was from men to pigs. The first American cases were recorded at Camp Funston on March 4. A week later, a member of Fort Riley’s catering staff entered the infirmary, followed in the coming days by a stream of infected soldiers. By the end of the month, more than a thousand cases had been recorded and 48 men had died of influenza. As if to mock the efforts of men to kill one another, the virus spread rapidly across the United States and then crossed to Europe on the jam-packed American troopships. It is possible that the pandemic explains the near doubling of the proportion of German soldiers reporting sick in the summer of 1918, which was a crucial factor in the imperial army’s subsequent collapse. Certainly, we have reports of German prisoners of war with the flu from July. By that time it had reached India, Australia and New Zealand. A few months later, a second and deadlier wave struck all but simultaneously in Brest, France; Freetown, Sierra Leone; and Boston. The virus made a new landfall in the United States at Boston’s Commonwealth Pier on Aug. 27, 1918, when three cases of influenza appeared on the sick list. Eight cases emerged the next day, and 58 the next, 15 of whom were so ill they were transferred to the U.S. Naval Hospital in Chelsea. On Sept. 8, influenza arrived at the Army’s Camp Devens. Within 10 days, thousands of feverish patients overwhelmed the camp’s hospitals; within weeks, the morgue was full of blue-tinged, asphyxiated corpses. Combatant countries sought to suppress the news of the pandemic as potentially harmful to wartime morale; this hardly helped to keep the public informed. The disease came to be known as the Spanish flu because only the largely uncensored press of neutral Spain reported on it with any accuracy. Between 40 million and 50 million people died as a result of the pandemic, the majority of them suffocated by a lethal accumulation of blood and other fluid in the lungs. The absolute numbers were highest in India (18.5 million deaths) and China (between 4 million and 9.5 million), but death rates varied widely from place to place. Close to half (44.5%) of the population of Cameroon was wiped out; in Western Samoa, nearly a quarter (23.6%). The worst mortality rates in Europe were in Hungary and Spain (each around 1.2%), with Italy not far behind. By contrast, North America got off lightly: between 0.53% and 0.65% for the United States, 0.61% for Canada.

Read Full Article at RT.com","The UK’s health secretary, Sajid Javid, has said the government is considering placing exclusion zones around schools to stop protests by anti-vax “idiots,” amid concerns about the growing scale of the problem. Speaking to Britain’s Sky News on Monday, Javid joined the chorus of politicians supporting restrictions around schools to prevent anti-vaxxers from targeting children with misinformation about Covid jabs. “You’ve got, frankly, these idiots outside their school spreading vicious lies,” Javid said, adding that the government believes “It is becoming a growing problem as time goes by.” Among the options the health secretary said were under consideration are exclusion zones around schools to halt these protests. However, Javid said it should be up to local officials to decide what restrictions to impose, rather than the national government. The senior Tory’s backing of exclusion zones came after Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called on councils to use exclusion zones to prevent “sickening” anti-vaxxers from pushing “dangerous misinformation” to school-aged children. Also on rt.com Now scientists have confirmed that natural immunity is more effective than vaxxed immunity, why can’t I have my freedoms back?

However, Javid said it should be up to local officials to decide what restrictions to impose, rather than the national government. The senior Tory’s backing of exclusion zones came after Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called on councils to use exclusion zones to prevent “sickening” anti-vaxxers from pushing “dangerous misinformation” to school-aged children.

It is the second COVID-19 booster vaccine to be approved in the EU. “This follows data showing that a third dose of Spikevax given 6 to 8 months after the second dose led to a rise in antibody levels in adults whose antibody levels were waning,” the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said. Earlier this month, the EMA approved Pfizer-BioNTech’s booster and recommended a third dose of a shot from either Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna for people with weakened immune systems. It left EU member states to decide if the wider population should receive a booster. EMA on Monday said that the implementation of vaccination campaigns remains the prerogative of the advisory groups guiding the vaccination campaigns in each EU Member State. Under pressure to revive their economies, fight the more infectious Delta variant of the coronavirus and avoid further lockdowns in the winter, several EU member states launched their own booster campaigns before EMA guidelines. The different states have taken widely varying views on who is eligible. The EMA said the risk of inflammatory heart conditions or other very rare side effects after a booster is being monitored.

KUCHING, Oct 26 ― Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture Datuk Seri Abdul Karim Rahman Hamzah calls for no open campaign and no open rally to facilitate the next Sarawak election.“No open campaigning or no open rally does not mean that democracy is curtailed,” the Parti Pesaka Bumiputera Bersatu (PBB) vice president said.Abdul Karim pointed out that there are other ways and means candidates in election can promote themselves, especially in this digital era.“We have seen what had happened in Sabah after they held their snap state election (in September 2020),” said the Asajaya assemblyman.“In view of Sarawak having to undergo a state election soon, it is advisable for the Election Commission (or SPR) to find ways to make sure that the ‘mistakes’ made during last Sabah state election are not repeated,” he added.Abdul Karim was reacting to the latest comment by Minister of Health Khairy Jamaluddin that no election-related social gatherings or activities are allowed to facilitate the coming Melaka snap state election in order to reduce Covid-19 infection among people there.Khairy said the order is to take effect yesterday (October 25) until November 27, 2021.When contacted yesterday, Parti Rakyat Sarawak (PRS) secretary-general Dato Janang Bungsu said he agreed with Khairy.“Agree that it should be within the stipulated standard operating procedures (SOPs). After all, we are yet to come out from Covid-19 problem. Stringent SOPs must be observed to minimise physical contact,” added Janang.Progressive Democratic Party (PDP) vice president Datu Dr Penguang Manggil however said it would still be premature now to talk about SOPs for Sarawak election which is being stalled as the state is under the Emergency Order (EO) until its expiry on February 1, 2022.“The SOPs mentioned therein are for Melaka, during this given time and circumstances. It may be relevant to be imposed in Melaka but may or may not be necessary for Sarawak,” said the Assistant Minister of Housing and Local Government.“It is also too premature to talk about the SOPs as we have to know when the Emergency is to be lifted and the State Legislative Assembly (DUN) is to be dissolved.“I am pretty confident that the Ministry of Health (MoH), State Health Department, the SPR and the Sarawak Disaster Management Committee will be duly consulted and SOP formulated, taking all factors and any emerging issues before the decision to call for the PRN12 (12th Sarawak election) is made,” said Penguang, who is also Marudi assemblyman.Khairy had said in a media statement on October 24: “Based on the monitoring by the Ministry of Health, among the contributors to the increase in cases and Covid-19 clusters in the country were related to the activities of gatherings or social gatherings that did not comply with the standard operating procedures (SOPs).”The MoH expected that similar activities will take place leading up to the Melaka state election on November 20, he said.“As the risk of Covid-19 infection is still high, especially with the spread of the Delta variant in the community, and the increasing number of new Covid-19 cases which have been reported, such activities will further increase the risk of Covid-19 infection within the community,” he said.Last Monday, the SPR set November 8 as the nomination date for the Melaka state election while the voting date is November 20.Khairy explained that this ban is in line with the list of unauthorised activities (negative list) in the latest SOPs for states under Phase 4 of the National Recovery Plan (PPN).Talks are rife in Sarawak that nomination day and polling day for the state election are slated for Nov 13 and Nov 27 respectively if the Yang di-Pertuan Agong wishes to repeal the EO earlier than its expiry date. ― Borneo Post",2021-10-25 23:28:05,,,malaymail,"[('Abdul Karim', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY'), ('Karim Rahman Hamzah calls', 'PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY'), ('Health Khairy', 'ORGANIZATION'), ('Rakyat Sarawak', 'ORGANIZATION')]"

American defenseman Megan Keller committed an undisciplined roughing penalty that led to the decisive goal. Keller cross-checked a Canadian player near the benches. Brianne Jenner set up the goal by driving into the right circle and feeding a wide-open Fillier, who swept in the puck at the left post.

Marie-Philip Poulin set up the opening goal 36 seconds in by beating Kelly Pannek off the puck at the right boards. U.S. defenders then backed up, allowing Bach to drive into the slot and lift a shot over Hensley’s glove. A defensive breakdown led to Fillier’s first goal. Canada’s Melodie Daoust outworked Natalie Buchbinder for the puck behind the net and was falling backward while getting a pass off to the left circle, where Natalie Spooner immediately fed a wide-open Fillier, who snapped it into the open right side. The Americans responded with Barnes’ power-play goal with 7:28 left in the first period. Barnes banked in a rising shot from the right point off the far post, with Desbiens screened by Lacey Eden.

Canada’s Ann-Renee Desbiens stopped 18 shots while USA’s Nicole Hensley stopped 17. The series resumes at Kingston, Ontario, on Nov. 21. American defenseman Megan Keller committed an undisciplined roughing penalty that led to the decisive goal. Keller cross-checked a Canadian player near the benches. Brianne Jenner set up the goal by driving into the right circle and feeding a wide-open Fillier, who swept in the puck at the left post. Though the Americans rebounded from an early 2-0 deficit to tie the game at 2 on Kessel’s goal 5:34 into the second period, they have yet to enjoy a lead over the past two games. The world’s top women’s hockey powers are preparing for the Beijing Winter Games in February, with the Americans attempting to defend their 2018 gold medal. Five of their past eight meetings have been decided by one goal. The Americans vowed to learn from their lapses on Friday, and yet quickly fell into a 2-0 hole 5:03 in, with defensive breakdowns allowing Canada to score on its first two shots on net. Marie-Philip Poulin set up the opening goal 36 seconds in by beating Kelly Pannek off the puck at the right boards. U.S. defenders then backed up, allowing Bach to drive into the slot and lift a shot over Hensley’s glove. A defensive breakdown led to Fillier’s first goal. Canada’s Melodie Daoust outworked Natalie Buchbinder for the puck behind the net and was falling backward while getting a pass off to the left circle, where Natalie Spooner immediately fed a wide-open Fillier, who snapped it into the open right side. The Americans responded with Barnes’ power-play goal with 7:28 left in the first period. Barnes banked in a rising shot from the right point off the far post, with Desbiens screened by Lacey Eden. NOTES: Three-time U.S. Olympian Kacey Bellamy was honored during a pregame ceremony in which USA Hockey officials presented her a No. 22 jersey. Bellamy retired in May 2020. … The U.S. has a hole in its schedule after a COVID-19 lockdown forced Russia to pull out of a three-game series in Belfast, Northern Ireland, starting on Nov. 9. “It’s the world we’re living in today. We just need to learn to adapt and adjust,” said Katie Million, USA Hockey’s director of women’s national team programs. Million is attempting to schedule another opponent, though the games aren’t likely to be played in Belfast. … USA F Abby Roque did not play and was spotted walking on crutches on Sunday. She fell awkwardly on her right ankle during the third period on Friday.","

Negros Oriental appeals Alert Level 4 status,https://www.rappler.com/nation/negros-oriental-appeals-alert-level-4-status,,['Robbin M. Dagle'],,The provincial COVID-19 isolation hospital capacity is at a critical 92% but Governor Roel Degamo says their hospitals also accommodate patients from Siquijor and southern Cebu,"Fearing more economic setbacks, the provincial government of Negros Oriental has appealed the national coronavirus task force’s decision to place the province under Alert Level 4. While the province has one of the the highest COVID-19 case rates in Central Visayas and its hospital utilization rate is in the red zone, Governor Roel Degamo announced on Monday, October 25, that he was deferring the implementation of an executive order that adopts the Alert Level 4 guidelines of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF). The province’s official page shows a 92% isolation bed capacity. In the capital Dumaguete City, all hospitals are now at critical to beyond full capacity: the government-run Negros Oriental Provincial Hospital (NOPH) at 113%, Silliman University Medical Center at 90%, Holy Child Hospital at 95%, and ACE Dumaguete Doctors at 113%. Other areas in the Visayas like Bacolod City, Iloilo province, Iloilo City, and Negros Occidental were previously placed under the Department of Health’s Alert Level 4 when their hospital capacity rates hit at least 80%. Degamo, however, said one factor for the province’s full hospitals is that they accommodate patients from neighboring provinces such as Siquijor and southern Cebu. High case rates The governor said in a Facebook video that one of the reasons for the appeal is the “decline” of cases in the province. While the number of daily new cases have slightly decreased in recent days, Negros Oriental’s number of active cases is still the highest compared to neighboring provinces in Central Visayas. The provincial health office recorded a total of 2,530 active cases as of October 25. During the provincial IATF meeting on October 20, local officials expressed concern that the “unexpected declaration” would “adversely affect local businesses and jobs,” according to a report of state-run Philippine News Agency. Negros Oriental is among the 14 pilot provinces placed under the new “alert level” system from October 20 to 31. Under the new scheme, limitations are set for high-risk establishments and activities, while the fully-vaccinated enjoy certain perks depending on the alert level.  For the national government, the new scheme is supposed to be more relaxed than the old community quarantine system, as it allows full operation of less risky establishments and “non-essential” activities even underAlert Level 4. But recently, governors have also asked the national IATF for more time to study the new guidelines. Vaccination rates in Negros Oriental may also complicate the implementation of the alert level system, which has specific conditions that require full inoculation of employees in certain establishments such as restaurants, barbershops, salons, and spas. As of October 25, 163,264 residents in Negros Oriental have been fully vaccinated. This is only 17% of the 908,939 total target population of people 18 and above, and 11.3% of the province’s total population of 1.43 million. Staffing problems Degamo also appealed to the Department of Health to help the province augment hospitals’ manpower. He said that hospitals have already limited their COVID-19 beds due to the lack of healthcare workers. Dr. Liland Estacion, incident commander of the provincial IATF, said in a virtual press briefing that there were 20 vacancies for nurses in the government-run NOPH, but nobody wants to apply. “How can we accommodate people, how can we serve people nga kulang man kaayo? And then, that’s the reason why magka-COVID na kay sobra sobra na kaayo ang ratio of one nurse to a patient,” Estacion said on October 25. (How can we accommodate people, how can we serve people if we lack people? The reason why our healthcare workers get COVID is that the ratio of one nurse to a patient is too high.) “I’m now calling the deans of the school of nursing, naa’y daghang nipasar (many have passed the board exam), where are they now?

Eight things we learned from the Facebook Papers,https://www.theverge.com/22740969/facebook-files-papers-frances-haugen-whistleblower-civic-integrity,,['Russell Brandom'],,,"A massive new document release shows chaos and confusion inside the world’s most powerful social network For months, Facebook has been shaken by a steady leak of documents from whistleblower Frances Haugen, beginning in The Wall Street Journal but spreading to government officials and nearly any outlet with an interest in the company. Now, those documents are going much more public, giving us the most sweeping look at the operations of Facebook anyone not directly involved with the company has ever had. The documents stem from disclosures made to the SEC and provided to Congress by Haugen in redacted form. The Verge and a consortium of other news organizations have obtained redacted versions of the documents, which we’re calling The Facebook Papers. In order to receive the documents, we agreed to begin publishing our reporting on them this week, but we are not beholden to report on them in a certain way or coordinate what we cover with other outlets. We’ve already done some reporting on the files, and we’ll keep reporting on them over the coming weeks. (There are a lot of pages.) This isn’t a comprehensive list of everything in the documents, and you should fully expect more to come out. Instead, think of it as a summary of the files that, so far, have stood out to us the most. Hopefully, it will help you make sense of the sheer volume of Facebook news coming out this morning. Facebook was caught off guard by vaccine misinformation in comments Facebook has taken a lot of criticism for its handling of COVID misinformation — including from President Biden, who accused the platform of “killing people” by letting anti-vaxx sentiment run amok — but the leaks show just how chaotic the effort was inside the company. One document dated March 2021 shows an employee raising the alarm about how unprepared the platform was. “Vaccine hesitancy in comments is rampant,” the memo reads. “Our ability to detect vaccine-hesitant comments is bad in English, and basically non-existent elsewhere. We need Policy guidelines specifically aimed at vaccine hesitancy in comments.” (Editor’s note: We are not publishing the document itself since it contains the full name of a Facebook employee.) “Comments are a significant portion of misinfo on FB,” says another employee in an internal comment, “and are almost a complete blind spot for us in terms of enforcement and transparency right now.” “For English posts on Vaccines, vaccine hesitancy prevalence among comments is 50 percent.” The document makes clear that Facebook already had a “COVID-19 lockdown defense” project dedicated to the platform dynamics created by the pandemic, including a workstream dedicated entirely to vaccine hesitancy. That team had also created significant automated flagging systems for misinformation — but according to the files, those simply weren’t being used to downrank anti-vaccine comments. As of the March memo, there were no plans to develop moderation infrastructure like labeling, guidelines, and classifier systems to identify anti-vaccine statements in comments. The failure to meaningfully moderate comments was noticed outside the company. A First Draft News study in May looked at the comments for a handful of major news outlets with more than a million followers and found one in five comments on vaccine-related stories contained some kind of anti-vaccine misinformation. The documents show Facebook was aware of the problem, and First Draft may have even underestimated the issue. One comment on the post reads, “for English posts on Vaccines, vaccine hesitancy prevalence among comments is 50 percent.” Other aspects of the issue remained completely unstudied since the company had yet to dig in on the comment problem. “We currently don’t understand whether Group comments are a serious problem,” the post argues. “It’s clear to us that the ‘good post, bad comment’ problem is a big deal, but it’s not necessarily as clear that [vaccine hesitant] comments on [vaccine hesitant] posts are additive to the harm.” Another document published shortly after April 2021 shows the company still coming to terms with vaccine misinformation. The good news was that there was no evidence of a foreign influence campaign driving anti-vaxx sentiment, as had stung the company in 2016. But the vast majority of content was being sent by a relatively small portion of accounts, suggesting that Facebook had not yet taken the easiest measures to address the issue. Facebook has taken some steps recently to address misinformation in comments — including new downranking rules from just last week. But these documents show those changes came more than six months after the alarm had been raised internally and after Facebook had publicly expressed anxiety about the impending leak. Given the huge surge of COVID deaths among vaccine-skeptical populations over the past three months, it’s easy to see the recent changes as too little, too late. Apple threatened to ban Facebook over online “slave markets” Facebook scrambled to address human trafficking content after Apple threatened to kick its apps off the iOS App Store, a leaked SEV (or Site Event) report shows. The report, referenced briefly by The Wall Street Journal’s Facebook Files reporting, indicates that Apple threatened to pull Facebook and Instagram from iOS on October 23rd of 2019. Apple had been tipped off by a BBC News Arabic report that found domestic workers being sold via Instagram and other apps, where sellers encouraged buyers to mistreat the workers by doing things such as confiscating their passports. the policy was “highly likely leading to exploitation of domestic servants” Facebook had been aware of the problem but hadn’t understood the scope of it, apparently because very little content (less than 2 percent of the material it found) had been reported by users. “Removing our applications from Apple platforms would have had potentially severe consequences to the business,” the Facebook report notes. After Apple escalated the issue, Facebook moderators swept the platforms for keywords and hashtags mentioned in the BBC reporting, ultimately disabling 1,021 accounts and removing 129,121 pieces of content. Facebook also removed a policy exception letting established brick and mortar businesses like recruitment agencies post ads about domestic workers. Facebook determined that even if the businesses were legal, the policy was “highly likely leading to exploitation of domestic servants.” Apple was apparently satisfied with the mitigation measures, and the incident was closed within a week. The Civic Integrity team was often directly blocked by Zuckerberg One of the most alarming incidents uncovered by the papers was that Mark Zuckerberg personally intervened to ensure Facebook would comply with a repressive law instituted in Vietnam, agreeing to moderate more aggressively against “anti-state” content on the platform. The anecdote leads The Washington Post’s report on the papers and plays into a much more troubling dynamic described by Haugen before Congress. Facebook’s Integrity team had lots of ideas for how to make Facebook less harmful, but they were usually overruled, sometimes by Zuckerberg himself. Bloomberg News explores the issue in more detail, showing how the company often found its own efforts to downrank harmful content overwhelmed by the content’s inherent virality. As one employee put it, “I worry that Feed is becoming an arms race.” Politico highlights another employee quote showing just how demoralized the team had become. “If we really want to change the state of our information ecosystem, we need a revolution, not an evolution of our systems,” an employee wrote in October 2019. “If you don’t have enough good content to boost, it doesn’t matter how much you downrank the bad.” Facebook used a German anti-vaccine movement as a test case for more aggressive moderation Another document details Facebook’s so-called “Querdenken experiment,” in which the company’s moderators tested out a more aggressive moderation approach on a German conspiracy movement. Facebook’s Dangerous Content team was already developing a new classification — a “harmful topic community” — and the growing Querdenken was chosen as an experiment on how the classification would work in practice. As a Facebook employee writes in the document, “this could be a good case study to inform how we tackle these problems in the future” “this could be a good case study to inform how we tackle these problems in the future” Querdenken has become one of the leading anti-lockdown and anti-vaccination groups in Germany, with similarities to more extreme groups like QAnon. As the Facebook proposal framed it, the Querdenken movement had potential for violence but wasn’t yet linked to extreme enough activity that would justify banning followers from the platform entirely. The documents give few details about how the experiment proceeded, although clearly, some version of the Querdenken plan was implemented. (A later report says “results from some initial samples look promising.”) And judging by the company’s public statements, it did result in a meaningful change to moderation policy: in September, Facebook announced a new policy on “coordinated social harm,” specifically citing Querdenken as an example of the new approach in action. Unlike many of the other documents, the Querdenken experiment shows Facebook’s moderation system as relatively effective. The company identified the group before it caused significant harm, took action with an eye towards long-term consequences and was transparent about the policy shift after it took place. But the incident shows how complex the interplay of policy and enforcement can be, with broader policies often rewritten with an eye towards specific groups. And for supporters of Querdenken, it may be alarming to learn that the rules of the world’s largest social platform were rewritten specifically to keep their movement from gaining public support. Facebook’s January 6th response was shaped by glitches and delays Facebook discussed developing extreme “break-glass measures” to limit misinformation, calls to violence, and other material that could disrupt the 2020 presidential election. But when former President Donald Trump and his supporters tried to stop successor Joe Biden from being declared president on January 6th, 2021, Facebook employees complained these measures were implemented too late or stymied by technical and bureaucratic hangups. Reports at Politico and The New York Times outline Facebook’s struggle to handle users delegitimizing the elections. Internally, critics said Facebook didn’t have a sufficient game plan for “harmful non-violating narratives” that toed the line between misinformation and content Facebook wants to preserve as free speech. And some plans, like a change that would have prevented Groups from changing their names to terms like “Stop the Steal,” apparently got held up by technical problems. Facebook was trying to rebalance its News Feed for “civic health” The Wall Street Journal first revealed that news outlets and political parties had complained about users favoring negative and hyperbolic content. Facebook was considering ways to fix the problem, and one method involved re-weighting the News Feed to optimize for “civic health” instead of primarily focusing on meaningful social interactions or session time. In a product briefing called “Ranking For Civic Health,” Facebook acknowledged that “people think that political content on Facebook is low quality, untrustworthy, and divisive,” and the current ranking system was “not creating a wholly valuable civic experience for users.” (Based on document comment dates, the document was produced around January and February of 2020.) “people think that political content on Facebook is low quality, untrustworthy, and divisive” The document says Facebook’s ranking algorithm recommended civic content that users themselves didn’t report finding valuable — something earlier leaks have indicated was a problem with meaningful social interactions (MSI) and other engagement-based metrics. “Our current ranking objectives do not optimize for integrity outcomes, which can have dangerous consequences,” it says — for instance, MSI optimization was “contributing hugely to Civic misinfo,” and Facebook estimated that removing it from Civic posts would decrease it by 30 to 50 percent. Facebook tried to improve civic health by asking users explicitly what they thought constituted good civic content. This sometimes revealed even bigger problems — since Facebook apparently found that 20 to 30 percent of respondents “may say that known Civic hate is ‘good for the community’” in surveys. Facebook settled on a strategy to “prioritize the reduction of policy-violating content — such as Civic Hate or Civic Misinfo — even if the individual user finds it valuable” and aimed to reduce the prevalence of civic hate speech, misinformation, and inflammatory content by at least 10 percent. The company ran rebalancing experiments in February 2020 by slightly increasing the amount of “civic” News Feed content that a random set of users saw, then optimizing that content through different metrics (including MSI and whether people thought content was “worth your time”). It also ran a survey to collect how users felt about civic News Feed content. The company aimed to have a new optimization system chosen by March of 2020 — although it’s not clear how the coronavirus pandemic may have changed those plans. Why likes were never hidden on Facebook and Instagram A highly publicized plan from early last year to hide like counts on Instagram never happened because testing the change hurt ad revenue and led to people using the app less. A quiet test of the experience on the Facebook app was also killed after leadership told Zuckerberg that it wasn’t a “top barrier to sharing nor a top concern for people.” A lengthy internal presentation to Zuckerberg about the plan, dubbed Project Daisy, shows that there were concerns among leadership about how the Facebook app would have been perceived if Instagram hid like counts and Facebook did not, which is something employees who were involved in the project have told The Verge. Employees working on Instagram wanted to bill it as a way to depressurize the app for young people, but the team working on the Facebook app wasn’t into the idea. If Instagram went through with hiding likes, the presentation details how leadership at Facebook wanted to “minimize blowback to the Facebook app” for not hiding them and still “ensure credit ladders up to the Facebook company.” Instead of hiding likes for all users by default as was originally planned, Instagram earlier adopted a half measure by letting people opt into hiding their likes. Facebook’s “civic groups” policy stumbled over a simple design flaw In October 2020, Facebook announced that it would stop recommending civic and political groups to users in the US as part of a broader effort to avoid the mistakes of the 2016 election. (The policy was made permanent shortly after the January 6th riot.) But actually keeping those groups out of Facebook recommendation feeds has been a huge challenge for the company — and an internal document gives us new insight into why. The document shows Facebook employees grappling with a public article, flagged by the PR team, which found 30 separate groups still appearing in recommendation feeds in apparent violation of the policy. Escalated on January 19th, the document says many of the groups named in the report had been labeled as civic groups at one point — but were somehow still being recommended as part of facebook’s Groups You Should Join feature. Reducing churn could have solved almost all of the problems “Leakage has been there since Nov 2020 at the least,” the Facebook document reads. It’s not clear which article the document is referring to, but there were a number of reports spotting enforcement failures at the time. The Markup found a bunch of groups slipping through that January and again in June. Even now, it’s not clear the civic groups policy is being enforced as intended. At the time, most observers focused on the conceptual difficulty: it’s a hard philosophical problem to draw a clear line between which groups count as “civic” and even harder to scale it across a platform of Facebook’s size. But the internal report shows the real problem was much simpler. Facebook’s monitoring system (referred to in the report as “Laser”) had been trained to only look at the past seven days of content when determining whether a page fell into the “civic groups” category, which meant pages were constantly filtering in and out as the period viewed by the algorithm changed. In practice, that meant a pro-Trump or pro-Biden group could easily dodge the label by posting a few days worth of less obviously political content. The report estimates that a full 12 percent of labeled groups would churn out of the category from day to day. According to the report, 90 percent of the groups highlighted by the article had been caught by Facebook’s existing “civic groups” classifier — but they’d filtered out as part of the churn. So reducing churn alone could have solved almost all of the problems spotted by the report. There have been lots of stories like this over the past five years: Facebook sets a policy that seems measured and responsible, but a cursory test (usually from a journalist) shows banned content is still easily slipping through. From the outside, it’s often unclear how much of the problem is incompetence at Facebook and how much is just the inherent difficulty of managing a platform of that size. But in this case, the documents put the blame squarely on Facebook as a company. This was a high-profile policy with huge stakes for the country at large, with obvious delicacy in how it was implemented. A churn rate that high made it inevitable that targeted groups would slip through the cracks, and the company simply didn’t notice until reporters called them out.",2021-10-25 15:40:19,,,theverge,[]
