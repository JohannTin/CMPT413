"Right food can help beat depression, say nutritionists",https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/health/right-food-can-help-beat-depression-say-nutritionists-329914,,,,"Hyderabad, October 26 Eating the right food can help beat depression effectively during difficult times, say nutritionists. Troubles linked to personal health, family situation, financial condition, and any other issue which might trigger despair during Covid-19 pandemic is likely to result in causing mental depression among those facing these situations. The common belief is that people when depressed tend to consume food in excess. However, nutritionists say eating the right food will also help people overcome depression. A Lancet report recently indicated that more and more people are suffering from depression related problems due to the after-effects of Covid-19 pandemic. Commenting on linkage between food and depression, Dr N. Malleshwari, Chief Dietician amp; Nutritionist, Gleneagles Global Hospital said: ""Poor food choices and selection of foods might contribute to deficiency of the nutrients which actually can result in depression. Some amino acids like tryptophan, tyrosine, methionine, and phenylalanine are often helpful in treating many mild disorders including depression."" Mental depression is a serious problem that affects people around the world, and in many, this could be a life changing occurrence. ""While those who accept they are depressed, seek medical attention or counselling to overcome the condition, the best means to beat depression is to bring about lifestyle changes and start consuming a healthy diet. While medicines or counselling provide temporary relief, eating right food and bringing in positive lifestyle changes will help conquer the problem forever. Omega 3 fatty acids (EPA amp; DHA) elicit anti-depressant effects among humans and are very important to be included in diet,"" said Malleshwari. ""Human bodies normally produce molecules which are called free radicals which could lead to cell damage resulting in quick ageing and cause other problems. Consuming antioxidants-rich foods and vitamins-rich fruits and vegetables will have a positive impact on the brain and certainly lessen the destructive effects of free radicals. Foods like carrots, pumpkin, spinach, oranges, tomato, nuts and seeds, will be of great help,"" said Dr Arun Kumar, Chief Dietitian, SLG Hospitals. Swetha, HoD - Nutrition, Aware Gleneagles Global Hospital believes that eating small portions of proteins several times in a day will help boost energy in the human body and will clear the mind. ""Protein-rich tuna fish, turkey, chicken have amino acids which help the human body stay alert. Beans, peas, milk, soya, yogurt too are a good source of healthy proteins. People who are suffering from depression must ensure they do not consume alcohol, or smoke, and even cut down on caffeine intake to overcome the problem."" Overweight or obese people are more likely to suffer from depression because excess body weight will impact immune system and bring hormonal changes among both men and women. Obese individuals must immediately work on cutting down weight if they intend to overcome depression, and healthy food habits are a first step in that direction. Many people who are depressed also have problems with alcohol or drugs; and these not only can interfere with mood, sleep, and motivation, they can also reduce the effectiveness of depression medications.

The post These Scalp Massagers Claim to Promote Hair Growth, so Sign Me and My Tresses up appeared first on Lifehacker Australia.","In the last year alone, you’ve probably noticed the haircare industry bringing out more treatments targeting your scalp health — exfoliating scalp scrubs, micellar shampoos, detox sprays, and now, scalp massager brushes. Scalp massagers do exactly what it sounds like — they’re a handheld, brush-like device that you can use to stimulate and exfoliate the scalp. You’ve probably noticed them starting to pop up online, which of course has piqued your interest and you’ve ended up here. But is using one actually better for your scalp health than a massage with your fingers? Short answer: yep, it can be! Healthy hair starts with your scalp, so if your scalp is littered with dead skin cells and product buildup, it makes it much harder for your hair to grow properly. Regularly using a scalp brush when you shampoo your hair helps to remove all the dead skin cells and product that’s accumulated between washes. The massaging motion alone is also said to help stimulate growth, as it promotes blood circulation in the hair follicle and can help to deliver more nutrients. So you really don’t have anything to lose by incorporating one into your routine. Plus, they feel so damn good! That said, if you’re someone who suffers from scalp irritation, dandruff or psoriasis, you might want to skip the scalp massage. Rubbing or scrubbing the scalp when it’s in that condition can further cause irritation, inflammation and swelling. Scalp brushes act more as a preventative in this instance than a treatment. Ahead, we’ve rounded up a range of affordable scalp massagers you can buy online and have delivered to your door. READ MORE What Are Scalp Scrubs and How Do You Use Them?

Kennedy, Jr., Chairman of Children’s Health Defense (CHD), and Meryl Nass, MD have sent a letter to each member of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) highlighting the latest peer reviewed research that shows children have virtually zero risk of hospitalization and death from the COVID-19 virus. “Conversely, according to Pfizer’s own study trial data , the chance of death in children from the Pfizer vaccine is 107 times higher than death due to COVID,” said Dr. Brian Hooker, CHD Chief Science Officer. VRBPAC meets tomorrow, October 26, to decide whether or not to approve Pfizer’s experimental COVID vaccine for children ages five to eleven. Here are the VRBPAC committee members: Hana El Sahly, MD ; Paula Annunziato, MD ; Archana Chatterjee, MD; CAPT Amanda Cohn, MD ; Hayley Gans, MD ; Holly Janes, PhD ; Michael Kurilla, MD ; Myron Levine, MD ; H. Cody Meissner, MD ; Paul Offit; Steven Pergam, M D; Andrea Shane, MD ; Paul Spearman, MD ; Geeta K. Swamy, MD ; Gregg Sylvester, MD ; A. Oveta Fuller, PhD ; James Hildreth, Sr., Ph., MD ; Jeannette Lee, PhD ; Ofer Levy, MD ; Patrick Moore, MD ; Michael Nelson, M.D ; Stanley Perlman, MD ; Jay Portnoy, MD ; and Eric Rubin, MD . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is scheduled to meet November 2 and 3 to consider and vote upon the same experimental vaccine. If both committees approve the vaccine for this age group, the decision is then reviewed by CDC Director Rochelle Walensky to formalize the recommendation. “Parents should be aware that if these committees give Big Pharma an early holiday present, the vaccines will still only have emergency use authorization (EUA),” said CHD president and general counsel Mary Holland. “This means the shots are experimental and legally cannot be mandated under U.S. law. Parents can say no.” School administrators can also decline to incorporate any requirements regarding COVID vaccine status for attending school. “These administrators should not be in the uncomfortable position of being the vaccine police for the pharmaceutical industry,” commented Holland. “The choice for parents and school officials is simple. They should never allow the government to force a medical procedure on children especially when they have a minuscule risk of hospitalization and death from COVID.” Children have very low transmission rates of the virus as well. Additionally, the vaccine’s experimental mRNA technology has no long-term safety studies upon which parents can make informed decisions after weighing risks and benefits. And, if adult vaccines are any indication, the vaccine will start to wane in children in two to three months according to two recent studies . From mid-December, 2020 through October 15, 2021, the U.S. government’s database, the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) received 818,044 reports of injury following COVID vaccination including 17,128 deaths . ""These numbers are astounding,” said CHD Executive Director Laura Bono. “Half of all reports and two thirds of all deaths reported to the VAERS system in the U.S. since the tracking system was developed in 1990 relate to the COVID 19 vaccines. No physician with an ounce of integrity could possibly vote to approve such a risky vaccine to people of any age, let alone healthy five-year-olds who are at virtually zero risk for complications from COVID."" On October 20, well in advance of the FDA and CDC meetings, the Biden administration said it had procured enough vaccine to vaccinate all 28 million 5- to 11-year-olds in the U.S. To CHD’s knowledge, the Biden Administration has not released the dollar amount of taxpayer funds that was transferred to Pfizer for children’s shots but, even at the highly unlikely low cost of $1 a dose, it translates into $65 million dollars handed to Big Pharma before the vaccine was even FDA authorized and CDC recommended. “It’s no surprise that the federal government and Pharma already know how these votes will go,” said Holland. “These meetings are nothing more than empty rituals in support of lining Pharma’s pockets. Parents need to know that the fix is in and an approval from either of these committees means nothing in terms of the safety of the vaccines Pharma wants injected into their children.” The letter from Kennedy and CHD said that committee members “should not participate in an exercise disguising a foregone conclusion” and that “should you grant EUA status to this pediatric EUA vaccine, CHD is poised to take legal action against you and other VRBPAC voting members as well as the FDA. CHD will seek to hold you accountable for recklessly endangering this population with a product that has little efficacy but which may put them, without warning, at risk of many adverse health consequences...” According to recent data from Indiana University’s Observatory on Social Media, CHD’s website is shared on Twitter more often than those of the World Health Organization and CDC combined. This indicates that a growing number of Americans and citizens of the world are saying no to their government imposing health mandates, recommendations and other personal choices on them and their children that is clearly in violation of their individual rights. The same data also showed that CHD’s content, which recently reached nearly 10 million page views per month, is more widely shared than that from Reuters , The Daily Mail , The Washington Post , Newsweek and CNN. Dr. Meryl Nass will be conducting a live blog during the proceedings of both the VRBAC and ACIP meetings to interpret and comment on the presentations and votes from CHD-TV . Viewers can also submit questions to Dr. Nass in real time. To watch and participate in Dr. Nass’s live blog of both committee meetings, visit CHD.T V. Concerned members of the public can add a comment to the FDA VRBPAC Committee by Monday at midnight. ### Children's Health Defense is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. Its mission is to end childhood health epidemics by working aggressively to eliminate harmful exposures, hold those responsible accountable, and establish safeguards to prevent future harm.

He was 59. Tyler's manager said he died peacefully at home in Los Angeles Sunday morning. ""If you met him once you made a friend for life,"" his manager said. He is survived by his wife Jennifer Carno, whom he married in 2017. Tyler was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer in September 2018, he revealed this summer. He said doctors discovered it during a routine physical when he was 56. Tyler was best known for the role of Gunther, the Central Perk barista who had an unrequited crush on Jennifer Aniston's Rachel Greene. Warner Bros.

""Sabrina, the Teenage Witch,"" and ""Scrubs,"" and he even played himself once on ""Episodes"" with Matt LeBlanc. Most recently, he released a spoken-word performance of the poem ""If You Knew,"" which was adapted into a short video to raise awareness for the Prostate Cancer Foundation. Donations to the Prostate Cancer Foundation in Tyler's name may be made here. Last month, Tyler made an appearance via Zoom on the ""Friends: The Reunion"" special. The special, which aired on HBO Max, saw the main cast -- Courteney Cox, David Schwimmer, Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, and Matthew Perry -- revisit some of the biggest on-screen moments and discuss their memories of the show. Asked whether the ""Friends"" cast already knew about his illness, Tyler said the show's producers had been aware ""for a long time"" and that Schwimmer had corresponded with him on Instagram. According to the Mayo Clinic, prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer and the second-biggest cause of cancer death for men in the United States. While some types of prostate cancer grow slowly and may need minimal or even no treatment, others are aggressive and can spread quickly.

BREASTFEEDING AND CORONAVIRUS: MOTHERS WITH COVID-19 UNLIKELY TO PASS VIRUS IF THEY USE PROPER HYGIENE ""While many studies have found that breastfeeding improves a child’s long-term health and well-being, our study is one of very few that has looked at the long-term health effects for women who had breastfed their babies,"" Molly Fox, the study’s author, said in a news release . ""Our findings, which show superior cognitive performance among women over 50 who had breastfed, suggest that breastfeeding may be ‘neuroprotective’ later in life,"" she added. The study , titled, ""Women who breastfeed exhibit cognitive benefits after age 50,"" asserts that breastfeeding’s biological effects and psychosocial effects, such as improved stress regulation, could exert long-term benefits for the mother’s brain. ""Because breastfeeding has also been found to help regulate stress, promote infant bonding and lower the risk of post-partum depression, which suggest acute neurocognitive benefits for the mother, we suspected that it could also be associated with long-term superior cognitive performance for the mother as well,"" Fox said. Participants in the study, all women over 50 years old, completed a comprehensive battery of psychological tests measuring learning, delayed recall, executive functioning and processing speed. Results revealed that those who had breastfed at one point in their lives performed better in all four categories compared to women who had not.

4 Ways to Trim Your Nose Hairs Safely at Home,https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2021/10/best-nose-hair-removal-products/,"['Health', 'Life', 'affiliate', 'amazon-partnership', 'nose hair', 'nose hair removal']",['Lifehacker Staff '],,"Nose hair is one of those pesky things we all have, but some have a lot more than others. If... The post 4 Ways to Trim Your Nose Hairs Safely at Home appeared first on Lifehacker Australia.","Nose hair is one of those pesky things we all have, but some have a lot more than others. If you’ve ever had a good look up there in the bathroom mirror, you might be shocked at the amount of hair you have. Before you start hacking at it though, it’s important to know how to remove it safely. We’re here to share the four best nose hair removal methods you can do at home. READ MORE How to Clean Your Ears Safely at Home Without Cotton Tips Why do we have nose hair? Before you start the removal process, it’s important to know that your nose hair (while pesky) actually serves an important purpose for your health. It’s actually the first line of defence against bacteria and germs in the nasal cavity, so you don’t want to get rid of it all. More than that, it’s also part of the system that protects your lungs from dirt and debris that gets into the airways. If you didn’t have nose hair you’d be entirely vulnerable to all these things which opens you up to infections. So, if you do choose to manage the amount of nose hair for aesthetic purposes, it needs to be done properly and hygienically. How to get rid of nose hair at home Now that we’ve established the importance of nose hairs, we can chat about the safest methods of managing it at home. These are trimming, waxing, plucking and cutting (with specialised scissors). Manically pulling out the hair with tweezers is highly discouraged for a bunch of different reasons. First of all, it’s painful as hell but it’s also one of the less hygienic methods of removing hair. So put down the tweezers and try one of these four methods first. Best nose hair removal tools Now that we’ve told you explicitly what not to do, it’s time to focus on the tools that are actually safe to use at home. The good news is, you don’t have to be a professional and they’re really simple to operate and clean. Trimmers Philips Multigroom Series 7000 12-in-1, $109 This device is a best-seller for a reason – its versatility and affordability. Coming with 12 different heads, not only can you trim your nose hairs, but you can also shave your face, eyebrows, ears and anything else that needs some tidying up. Buy the Philips Multigroom Series 7000 12-in-1 ($109) from Amazon here. Panasonic ER430K Ear & Nose Trimmer, $35.08 The dual-edge blades on this trimmer make it easy to trim nose, ear and facial hair with precision. It’s fu waterproof so you can use it in the shower if you wish, and it has an advanced micro vacuum system to suck up trimmed hair particles into a chamber. Buy the Panasonic ER430K Ear & Nose Trimmer ($35.08) from Amazon here. Philips Series 3000 Ear, Eyebrow & Nose Trimmer, on sale for $24.95 (usually $29.95) The shape of this trimmer is specifically made to reach into your nose and earholes, making it a super easy trimmer option. It also has safeguards so you won’t hurt yourself if you make contact. Buy the Philips Series 3000 Ear, Eyebrow & Nose Trimmer ($24.95) from Amazon here. Plucking THE PLUCK Nose Hair Remover, $37.66 This looks like a torture device but it’s actually designed to be relatively pain-free. The beauty of this device is that it removes your nose hair at the root which diminishes its ability to grow back over time – so less plucking for you in the long run. Just pop the tip of the device into your nostril and pull down on the blue toggle to jerk the hairs out, then go forth and enjoy your hair-free nose. Buy THE PLUCK Nose Hair Remover ($37.66) from Amazon here. Scissors Nose Hair Trimming Scissors, $37.87 It might sound borderline insane to trim your nose hairs with scissors but it can actually be done (with the right tool). These scissors are a popular nose hair removal method as it’s not painful at all but still gives a very precise trim. Buy the Nose Hair Trimming Scissors ($37.87) from Amazon here. Waxing Nose Wax Kit, $19.99 This product isn’t for the faint-hearted, so if you’re looking for something relatively painless you might want to pass on this one. Essentially, you heat up the wax in the microwave before dipping the sticks in and inserting them into your nostrils. Give it around 90 seconds and then pull down as quickly as possible to rip the hairs right out. You’ll get the satisfaction of seeing all the hair once it’s removed but you may not be able to see it through the tears in your eyes. Buy the Nose Wax Kit ($19.99) from Amazon here. Nad’s Nose Wax Kit, $8.75 Same same, but a little cheaper and it’s formulated with chamomile and aloe extract to help your sensitive nose area as much as possible, considering you’re tipping all the hair out.

That site, EnableAir.com, appears to be connected to another B.C. doctor.",,2021-10-25 12:00:00,"A B.C. physician accused of spreading misinformation about COVID-19 is now under investigation for allegedly writing phoney mask and vaccine exemptions offered through a Kelowna-based website. CBC News has obtained a four-page ""declaration certificate of medical exemption including psychosocial conditions"" that was purportedly signed by Dr. Stephen Malthouse and produced through a service called EnableAir.com. That website appears to be connected to another B.C. doctor, Dr. Gwyllyn Goddard, whose medical licence is temporarily inactive. A copy of the same certificate has been sent to the College of Physicians and Surgeons of B.C. and they are investigating, CBC has confirmed. A spokesperson for B.C.'s Health Ministry did not answer direct questions about EnableAir.com, but confirmed there is no such thing as an exemption certificate for either masks or vaccines. EnableAir.com promises ""authentic medical exemptions,"" including QR codes, for people who are ""concerned with totalitarian mainstream narratives,"" and advertises the services of five unnamed Canadian physicians. It's not clear how much the service costs, but the website warns prospective customers to "" mentally prepare for the invoice ."" Audio Divorced Sask. parents fight in court over COVID-19 vaccination for teen daughter The certificate allegedly signed by Malthouse includes a two-page preamble invoking the Canadian Human Rights Act, the Constitution, the UN's Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights and the Nuremberg Code. It doesn't offer any specifics about why the bearer should be exempted from mask and vaccine mandates, but offers a long list of possible reasons, including vaccine allergies but also HIV, autism, ""impaired social development,"" asthma, eczema, migraines and ""personal belief."" Doctor already faces discipline related to COVID-19 The contact information displayed on the certificate obtained by CBC matches publicly listed contact information for Goddard. The Kelowna post office box is connected to his cannabis consulting firm , CanaBC Services Ltd., and the fax number is listed on his personal website . Goddard did not respond to emailed questions or text messages, and hung up on a reporter when contacted by phone. The full contents of EnableAir.com were taken offline within hours of that phone call. B.C. doctor disciplined for 'harmful' COVID-19 misinformation claims free speech violations Neither Malthouse nor his lawyer, Rocco Galati of Toronto, responded to questions about the certificate. EnableAir.com advertises that 50 per cent of ""post-administrative fees"" will be donated to Galati and the Constitutional Rights Centre, an organization he founded. However, Galati told CBC he has no connection to the website. Dr. Stephen Malthouse appeared at a rally against COVID-19 restrictions in Duncan, B.C., last November, referring to the disease as a 'so-called pandemic.' (YouTube) Malthouse, a family doctor on Denman Island, is already the subject of disciplinary proceedings at the college as well as complaints from at least 10 other physicians. Over the last year, he's appeared at several rallies against pandemic-related measures, falsely claiming that COVID-19 is no more deadly than the flu and that vaccines are more dangerous. His musings have gone viral online. According to a petition Malthouse filed in B.C. Supreme Court in June, he faces a reprimand from the college, which wants to bar him from speaking on issues related to COVID-19. Malthouse has asked the court to block those measures, arguing they're an infringement on his right to free speech. Doctors 'need to provide objective medical evidence' College registrar Dr. Heidi Oetter said she couldn't comment on any investigations into Malthouse or EnableAir.com, but the college has a standard for what's expected of any doctor writing exemptions. ""It's very clear about the need to provide objective medical evidence. You can't simply restate something just because the patient wants you to do that,"" she said. ""If somebody is signing a letter that is inconsistent with those expectations, they may face an investigation by the college and, if warranted, regulatory action."" The college posted a notice last week in response to reports of fraudulent exemption letters circulating in the province. It includes guidance for businesses or employers about how to identify a valid exemption. In B.C., proof of vaccination is required to access many non-essential services, and there are very few valid exemptions. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press) There's a very short list of acceptable reasons for an exemption or deferral from a COVID-19 vaccine, including a history of anaphylactic reactions to both mRNA vaccines like Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, and adenovirus vector vaccines like AstraZeneca. Ontario's College of Physicians and Surgeons has barred three doctors from issuing mask and vaccine exemptions in recent weeks. A spokesperson for that college said he couldn't comment on any possible connection to EnableAir.com. B.C. doctors urge action on colleague spreading COVID-19 misinformation Ontario doctor accused of spreading COVID-19 misinformation barred from providing vaccine, mask exemptions But one of those physicians, Dr. Patrick Phillips , has promoted EnableAir.com on social media . Another has a B.C. connection — Dr. Rochagne Kilian previously worked in Williams Lake, and held a medical licence in this province from 2009 to 2014. Oetter said while the rules are slightly different in B.C., similar restrictions could be placed on doctors here if evidence suggested they were providing fraudulent exemptions.

""Health systems and health care professionals have demonstrated a remarkable ability to rapidly adapt or modify care practices to deliver optimal cancer care, while minimizing risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and optimizing health system resources,"" said Professor Dorothy Keefe, CEO of Cancer Australia. ""A range of strategies has been identified to enhance and embed these high value changes in cancer care during the pandemic and in a post-pandemic environment."" ""These strategies allow flexibility for jurisdictions, organizations and individuals to address these priorities in ways that suit their local context and workforce capacity."" ""Regular and ongoing review of health care practices, underpinned by clear documentation of changes in practice and learnings, will be critical to maintaining optimal and sustainable value-based cancer care into the future.""

How did California go from COVID-19 epicenter to lowest statewide transmission rate?,https://6abc.com/california-covid-19-infection-rate-vaccination-requirements-vaccine-mandates/11165638/,,['ABCNews'],https://vcl.abcotv.net/video/wpvi/102521-wpvi-covid-vaccine-GMA-vid.mp4,"""We can't know for sure which factors are responsible,"" an epidemiologist said, ""but we know that the combination of interventions and policies can play a really strong role in driving transmission.""",,2021-10-25 12:21:01,"LOS ANGELES -- With the lowest COVID-19 infection rate among all states as of Friday, California, which has some of the strictest mask and vaccination mandates in the country, has managed to flip the script as the former U.S. epicenter of the pandemic. ""They've been very much forward-thinking in terms of policies around vaccination requirements and mandates,"" said epidemiologist Dr. John Brownstein, chief innovation officer at Boston Children's Hospital and an ABC News contributor. As of Friday evening, California had an infection rate of 61.1 cases per 100,000 over the past week, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The state was briefly the only to be classified with a ""moderate"" rate of transmission -- 10 to 49.99 cases per 100,000 over seven days -- before it went back up to ""substantial,"" meaning 50 to 99.99 cases per 100,000 over seven days. Over the previous week, Hawaii, Florida, Louisiana, Connecticut, New Jersey, Mississippi, Maryland, Georgia and Washington, D.C., each also reported ""substantial"" rates. A rate of at least 100 cases per 100,000 is labeled as ""high."" Montana, Wyoming, Idaho and Alaska, as of Friday, had the highest rates over the previous seven days, with each above 450 cases per 100,000 people. The U.S. average over that span was 150.9. Experts said California's journey from worst to first is likely due to a combination of things. ""We can't know for sure which factors are responsible,"" Brownstein added, ""but we know that the combination of interventions and policies can play a really strong role in driving transmission."" 'Ending this pandemic' More than 70% of California's population has received at least one dose of vaccine, according to the CDC , and the state also leads in total vaccinations administered, roughly 53 million doses. As of Friday, the national average rate was 66.2%. Being the first state to announce a COVID-19 vaccine requirement for schools, California has some of the strictest mandates in the U.S. The state has mandated vaccines for state employees, health care workers, teachers and at large indoor gatherings. ""The more aggressive the vaccination campaign, the better,"" Dr. Todd Ellerin, director of infectious diseases at South Shore Health, told ABC News. Given that vaccines are the most powerful tool we have in curbing the spread of COVID-19, experts said they believe California's emphasis on immunizations has provided big dividends. ""These results show quite clearly that vaccines offer protection for individuals who lack immunity, with important implications for finally ending this pandemic,"" Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, wrote in a blog post Tuesday. Idaho and Wyoming have some of the lowest vaccination rates and the highest transmission rates. All three COVID-19 vaccines available in the U.S. have since shown high effectiveness in preventing death due to COVID-19, and as of Friday, California boasted the lowest death rate in the country, with 0.3 per 100,000 over the previous week. The U.S. average over that span was 2.7 per 100,000. Additionally, experts told ABC News, having endured the harshest waves of infections last winter and the delta surge in July, formerly infected Californians may have acquired antibodies and more of a natural immunity to COVID-19 -- both factors that, in concert with vaccines, could be driving down case numbers. 'More work to do' In addition to strict vaccine mandates, California has been unwavering on face-coverings, testing and social distancing policies. ""While California has administered more vaccines than any other state, we have more work to do,"" the California Department of Public Health said in a statement to ABC News. Everyone, regardless of vaccination status, is required to wear a mask on public transit, in health care settings and at educational and correctional facilities. Masks are required for all unvaccinated people and recommended for vaccinated people in settings such as theaters, retail stores, restaurants and bars. Despite having a higher vaccination rate than California, states like Vermont are still falling behind on transmission rate rankings, which experts said points to the importance of distancing and masking. Breakthrough cases seen in Vermont can be further explained by its higher proportion of residents 65 and older. Mobility Research shows mobility, or movement in populations, can be a predictor of disease spread, especially via air travel or mass transit. This became evident through the surge of COVID-19 cases the U.S. saw during holiday season. Gov. Gavin Newsom pleaded with California residents on Christmas Eve to avoid holiday gatherings at a time when hospitals in the state were under ""unprecedented pressure."" Californian cities experienced a huge surge of cases and hospitalizations following the holidays, although rates have since declined. No stranger to stay-at-home orders, the California government imposed several lockdowns and restrictions to curb the spread of the virus. It celebrated its most recent reopening in mid-June, which replaced 15-month-long public health restrictions with conditions more akin to ""business as usual."" ""In the height of the pandemic, people were locked down, they weren't moving at all, they were staying at home,"" Brownstein told ABC News. ""The more people move around, that's usually an indicator for increased transmission."" The great outdoors The virus has been shown to spread more indoors and with people in close proximity to one another. California's sunny climate means more people spend more time outside. ""When we spend most of our time indoors, that's when transmission is greatest,"" Ellerin said. Added Brownstein: ""More close contacts with people outside your household indoors is what creates additional risk."" This effect is also compounded by the rise in the virus' effective reproductive number during the winter season with research suggesting that a drop in temperature encourages virus growth. Compared to many other states, especially as winter draws nearer, California is in ""quite a good spot,"" Brownstein said. ""In all likelihood, the trends that we're seeing are realistic and very much driven by compliance with masking and other interventions, plus the well-covered vaccination strategy in the state.""

Dorset Council reveals £37.5m plan for children with additional needs,https://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/news/19671722.dorset-council-reveals-37-5m-plan-children-additional-needs/?ref=rss,,,,DORSET Council has revealed how it is spending £37.5m of funding earmarked to improve the lives of children with additional needs - including the creation of new schools.,,2021-10-26 04:00:00,"READ MORE: Dorset Council's new £37.5m plan for children with additional needs The council developed the plans in response to the growing need for more special educational provision - with young people with Education, Health and Care Plans in Dorset nearly doubling between 2015 and 2020. Currently some children and young people with SEND must travel a great distance for educational provision, sometimes outside of the county, because there's not enough specialist provision available in Dorset. The council's roadmap to deliver the programme includes a scheme to open the Dorset Centre of Excellence – a new school in Shaftesbury based on the former St Mary's site to open with an initial 60 additional places in the 2021/22 academic year, with further phasing as it seeks to achieve 280 places in total over the subsequent years. The council is also working towards opening an additional site for Wimborne's Beaucroft Special School – which will bring approximately 75 additional places in 2022/23. The investment is also set to go towards the expansion of Inclusion Hubs across Dorset which will provide provision attached to mainstream schools. It is hoped that Inclusion Hubs will support children with SEND so that they can access the mainstream classroom, but also allow space to support children when they need more specialist support. The move expects to achieve an expansion of over 100 places over the next 5 years. Independent provision costs around £60,000 a year per child, whereas high quality provision at one of Dorset's own special schools costs around £22,000 a year per child. The SEND Capital Strategy aims to increase local provision and reduce some of these costs in the longer term. Cllr Andrew Parry, Dorset Council Portfolio Holder for Children, Education and Early Help, said; “Dorset Council is making a big investment in education and support for children with SEND and it’s of huge importance to us. We've developed these ambitious plans because the need for more SEND provision is growing fast and we want all our children and young people to have the best possible outcomes – to thrive. “This bold and ambitious strategy will focus on achieving the best education for all Dorset’s children and young people with SEND, while avoiding the need for a child to travel away from their family and friend networks to receive their education or support.” CONTACT ME: t: 01305 830999 e: marie-claire.alfonso @newsquest.co.uk twitter: @MCAlfonsoJourno",https://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/resources/images/13137168/,dorsetecho

Centers for Disease Control Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky remains coy on whether the Biden administration would support COVID-19 vaccine mandates for essential workers or students . President Biden signed an executive order on Sept. 9 that required federal employees to receive a vaccine. Some cities have enacted similar policies despite immense resistance from the very workers the policies intended to protect. VACCINE MANDATES CREATE CONFLICT WITH DEFIANT WORKERS Walensky refused to be drawn on direct comments regarding support for further vaccine mandates - particularly, one for essential workers. Instead, she focused on the need for vaccines and the ways in which the administration would encourage workers to get the vaccine. ""The most disruptive thing you can do to a workforce is to have a Covid outbreak in that workforce,"" Walensky told "" Fox News Sunday "" host Chris Wallace. ""That will most definitely not only send people home but it will send people to the hospital and some may pass."" Walensky said that the administration has ""a plan"" to encourage vaccinations and would point the more hesitant essential workers towards ""education and counseling to get people the information they need."" She cited numbers that showed that more police officers over the past year have died from COVID-19 than from all other causes of death combined. OBAMA: ‘I UNDERSTAND’ WHY AMERICANS WANT TO KNOW WHEN COVID-19 MANDATES WILL END' Police have remained a particularly resistant group. Major cities including Chicago and Los Angeles have enacted mandates for the police force, with New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio weighing his own possible mandate. A New York City police union has threatened legal action over a possible mandate, even though 70% of officers have already been vaccinated. Walensky also avoided a question on whether the administration would support a vaccine mandate for school-aged children. She discussed the need to get authorization and approval before discussing any mandates. NSBA's ‘DOMESTIC TERRORISM’ APOLOGY FALLS FLAT: ‘THESE ARE PARENTS, NOT TERRORISTS,’ DR. SAPHIER SAYS ""Right now we are at authorization, we're having discussions about authorization, so I think we need to get children vaccinated through this authorization and get to approval before we can make a judgment there,"" Walensky said. California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Oct. 1 signed a vaccine requirement for eligible school children to attend in-person lessons. The mandate, which does provide medical and personal belief exemptions, has prompted protests from some parents who suggest pulling their children out of school.

(Nasdaq: ERAS), a clinical-stage precision oncology company singularly focused on discovering, developing, and commercializing therapies for patients with RAS/MAPK pathway-driven cancers, today announced the presentation of preclinical data for ERAS-801, a small molecule epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor specifically designed to have high central nervous system (CNS) penetration for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Special Virtual Conference on Brain Cancer. “While mutations in EGFR are common oncogenic drivers in glioblastoma, approved EGFR inhibitors lack both sufficient CNS penetration for primary brain tumors and clinical activity against oncogenic EGFR alterations that are prevalent in GBM,” said Jonathan E. Lim, M.D., Erasca’s chairman, CEO, and co-founder. “ERAS-801 is an EGFR inhibitor with four times the CNS penetrance of approved EGFR inhibitors, resulting in robust CNS enrichment while limiting systemic exposure. In more than 30 GBM patient-derived preclinical models, ERAS-801 demonstrated potent activity across mutant and wildtype oncogenic EGFR alterations, and we are highly encouraged by the extensive therapeutic potential of ERAS-801 for patients with this aggressive malignancy.” David A. Nathanson, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), added, “About 60% of glioblastomas are driven by oncogenic alterations in EGFR that include amplifications and mutations such as the highly prevalent vIII deletion. Wildtype EGFR has a pathogenic role in glioblastoma and can drive disease following amplification or through heterodimerization with mutant EGFR. Effective disease control of glioblastoma ultimately requires comprehensive inhibition of both mutated and wildtype forms of EGFR, which approved EGFR inhibitors do not currently achieve. Our work demonstrates that ERAS-801 can improve outcomes in over 90% of diverse EGFR-driven patient-derived tumor models, highlighting a comprehensive inhibitory profile that has robust potential to effectively treat patients with CNS cancers with poor prognosis.” About ERAS-801 ERAS-801 is a highly potent, selective, and reversible small molecule EGFR inhibitor with significantly enhanced CNS penetration. ERAS-801 has a 3.7:1 brain-to-plasma ratio and a K p,uu (partition coefficient that measures unbound drug concentration) that is up to four times higher than approved EGFR inhibitors, indicating a higher concentration of unbound drug in the brain compared to the blood. Utilizing fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), a pharmacodynamic marker of metabolically active tumors, the Nathanson lab evaluated inhibition of tumor metabolism in over 30 patient-derived preclinical glioblastoma models following treatment with different FDA-approved EGFR inhibitors. At clinically relevant exposures, ERAS-801 demonstrated a survival benefit in over 90% of EGFR mutant and/or amplified glioblastoma patient-derived models tested to date and had statistically significantly higher brain penetrance and prolonged survival compared to approved EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. ERAS-801 was designed and developed by a renowned team of UCLA cancer researchers—David Nathanson, Ph.D., Michael Jung, Ph.D., and Timothy Cloughesy, M.D. Erasca plans to submit an IND filing for development in refractory GBM in the first quarter of 2022.

"Amid 'great resignation,' group calls for more fertility benefits coverage",https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/amid-great-resignation-group-calls-for-more-fertility-benefits-coverage-1.5637635,,['Marlene Leung'],,"As Canadian firms struggle to fill job vacancies, one advocacy group is calling on companies to increase their benefits coverage to include fertility treatments.",,2021-10-25 20:22:00,"TORONTO -- As Canadian firms struggle to fill job vacancies, one advocacy group is calling on companies to increase their benefits coverage to include fertility treatments. A recent survey from the Business Development Bank of Canada found that 55 per cent of Canadian small and medium-sized employers are struggling to hire the workers they need. The survey also found that more than 26 per cent are having a hard time retaining their staff. According to the survey, which also polled employees, a desire for higher wages was the primary reason workers planned to change jobs in the next year, followed by increased benefits. Tara Wood, board president of the advocacy group Conceivable Dreams, says now, amid the “great resignation,” is the “perfect time” for society to be having discussions on what kinds of fertility benefits employers can offer their workers. “COVID has shown us that there’s a different way to live,” she told CTVNews.ca in a phone interview. “People are looking for their employers to step up.” FERTILITY BENEFITS IN CANADA Fertility benefits can cover a wide range of treatments, including procedures, such as intrauterine insemination (IUI), in vitro fertilization (IVF), testing and egg freezing, as well as the cost of fertility drugs. The cost of treatments can range from an average $400 per year for egg, sperm or embryo storage to up to $20,000 per cycle of IVF. Infertility affects one in six Canadian couples, a number that has doubled since the 1980s, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada . While there has been an increase in the number of American companies offering fertility coverage in their health-care plans, Canadian companies have been slower to adapt, says Wood. “I started meeting with employers last year,” Wood said. “There’s certainly appetite (for providing fertility benefits), but there’s a big difference between saying these policies make sense and actually doing it. Talking about doing it and actually doing it are two different things, and very few are doing it in Canada right now.” Earlier this year, Conceivable Dreams released the findings of a study that reviewed employer benefit plans in Canada. The review included a sample of small to large employers, across all provinces and in all industries. The study found that the majority of Canadian employers do not offer any fertility benefits. Of those companies that did offer fertility benefits, the average lifetime coverage was $3,250. As well, only five per cent provided coverage for both fertility drugs and the costs of fertility procedures, the study found. COMPANIES ‘WALKING THE TALK’ Aside from helping out employees with the financial cost of infertility, providing fertility benefits shows employees that companies are “walking the talk” when it comes to creating inclusive policies, says Woods. Fertility for most women starts to decline in their 30s, which often forces women to make a choice mid-career between starting a family or continuing on their career path. “If an employer is truly dedicated to gender equity within their organizations, these types of benefits, are really important, because it allows people to choose when they want to have a family,” Wood said. “When we have options like egg freezing (coverage), which allows that couple to have that child five, six years down the road, that’s a huge benefit.” Fertility benefits that cover a range of treatments would also help LGBTQ2S+ couples who are looking to have a child, as well as lower-income families or single people who may not have the financial means to pursue fertility treatments, she added. “We all need to play a role in making fertility more accessible.” NEW ‘MINIMUM STANDARDS’ While employers may have concerns about increasing the price of their benefit plans, adding fertility coverage doesn’t have to substantially add to your bottom line, says Yafa Sakkejha, CEO of Beneplan. Beneplan, which is an intermediary between employers and insurance companies, recently introduced a new series of “minimum health standards” to all their benefit plans, including coverage of $2,500 per lifetime for fertility drugs. Sakkejha said her underwriters found that offering $2,500 in fertility coverage, resulted in an increase in the health premium by less than one per cent. She said since making the addition to the plans, over 90 per cent of her clients are choosing to renew it, with both management and HR departments getting on board. “This is win-win-win,” Sakkejha told CTVNews.ca, noting that it a step in the right direction. “We’re starting to inch towards better coverage.” Related Stories Party leaders pledge to support workers with more benefits Pregnancy, birth and fertility care need to be more gender inclusive, advocates say These Canadian industries are currently facing the biggest labour shortages Ontario fertility clinics left in limbo after directive to cease non-emergency procedures Share: Reddit Share Report an error Editorial standards and policies Why you can trust CTV News More Health Stories Amid 'great resignation,' group calls for more fertility benefits coverage Cannabis vaping doubled among teens in Canada, U.S. since 2013: study Rise in teen girls with 'tic-like' behaviours could be linked to TikTok, doctors say Quebec study shows childhood TB vaccine may not offer long-term protection against COVID-19 China to start vaccinating children as young as 3 against COVID-19 Parents more hesitant to vaccinate kids than themselves, researcher says Canadian entrepreneur gifts $5 million to help create psychedelic research centre for mental health Aromatherapy spray recalled in U.S. linked to deaths in four states First of its kind website aims to provide resources about palliative care for kids Top Videos false Woman throws hot coffee at employee in possible hate crime false Police in Kingston, Ont. crackdown on huge student parties false What is a 'bomb cyclone'?

Wild lettuce is just one such plant that has been used this way, usually for pain relief and to aid sleep. Wild lettuce ( lactuca virosa ) has recently shown promise in research as both a nootropic (a substance that can help improve cognitive function) and painkiller. The powerful plant is a part of the Asteraceae plant family which has 23,600 species around the globe (making it a member of one the largest plant families worldwide), and is usually found in various areas of the world including Iran, Austria, France, Germany, and Scotland. Because of its psychoactive properties, wild lettuce is sometimes used recreationally by people looking for a natural buzz. What are the benefits of wild lettuce? Wild lettuce contains two beneficial compounds (lactucin and lactucopicrin) that act on the central nervous system as a painkiller and sedative. Wild lettuce has the highest concentration of lactucopicrin of all plants, and is also meant to have potent antimicrobial properties. Certain types of sesquiterpene lactones found in wild lettuce can even help to reduce inflammation, potentially alleviating pain from specific ailments like arthritis. A study in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology in 2018 found that lactucopicrin actually increased neuritogenesis in brain cells extracted from lab rats, which is promising in terms of helping fight Alzheimer’s disease. Neuritogenesis is a phenomenon in which nerve cells sprout neurites (projections), that connect one nerve cell to another, strengthening the transmission of nerve signals. Based on these properties, it is thought that wild lettuce may be able to help prevent or alleviate certain conditions including: Alzheimer’s disease Arthritis Asthma Atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) Coughs Hyperactivity Insomnia Joint pain Malaria Menstrual pain To find out more about the potential benefits and side effects of wild lettuce pain killer , head over to the Fresh Bros website or get in touch with a team member today!

New advice issued by Dorset's public health chief amid rising covid cases,https://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/news/19671074.new-advice-issued-dorsets-public-health-chief-amid-rising-covid-cases/?ref=rss,,,,THE DIRECTOR of Public Health Dorset has issued new advice following a 'rapid' rise in covid cases.,,2021-10-25 13:59:15,"""In other parts of the South West we're seeing councils with cases reaching seven and eight hundred cases per hundred thousand, so we need to do something differently and we need to understand that the situation is changing."" Mr Crowe said local hospital admissions have started to climb despite 'holding fairly steady in the last week.' He added: ""Not all of these infections are linked with schools, although we have high infection rates in school-aged children. They're now starting to affect older age groups so we're seeing infections in parents and we're also seeing this spread into older age groups and that's the concern."" ""In our local system which is already really stressed, we don't have much room for manoeuvre. Any additional admissions due to covid just put more pressure on the hospital system, which is really trying hard to catch up with all of those people who have had delays to their urgent treatment during the pandemic."" Mr Crowe has asked the public to do three things to prevent cases from rising further: ""Know your risk and understand that this is changing quite quickly with rising cases so think about those additional measures you can take to protect yourself and others. ""I'm asking you to act: airborne transmission is really crucial that's how the virus spreads, so think about those measures that can prevent that happening. If you're meeting indoors remember to keep doors and windows open, ventilation is really crucial. Wear a mask if you're mixing with other people you wouldn't normally mix with in enclosed indoor areas and remember the importance of distance as well. ""Finally protect, so remember lateral flow testing is really important for spotting early cases and asymptomatic cases of covid. Also, if you haven't had your vaccination or you're not up to date with your second jab, please do look out for those opportunities to get fully vaccinated."" Mr Crowe also addressed the roll out of the booster vaccination programme in Dorset asking those who have been contacted, to ""please take up that opportunity."" In a final statement the Public Health Dorset Director said: ""Over the next few weeks, I'm just asking you to do all you can to try to help us keep a lid on our cases. ""None of us want to go back to that situation where we saw restrictions being brought in, we've got a small window now where if we act together, hopefully we can stave off the need to bring in more serious measures further down the line. So, let's keep going thank you.""",https://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/resources/images/13135837/,dorsetecho

Musician Arturo Fermill, also known as D.J. Buddha Sax, says the demand of his services has only declined since the province’s announcement that capacity limits would be lifted. “I would usually have, in normal times, twenty to thirty gigs booked for Christmas parties, corporate events, even winter weddings right up until Christmas Eve but I currently have one that’s a ‘maybe,’ which will be eventually be cancelled due to the fact that their employees aren’t able to dance on the dance floor.” Story continues below advertisement Fermill believes the province underestimated how much revenue would be lost by B.C. small businesses when they chose to leave ‘indoor event dancing’ off the list of activities that were now allowed. “We now need the government to not have this oversight, because it really is an oversight.” Read more: B.C. lifting COVID-19 capacity limits on gatherings for much of province Micheal Ghirra, who is the owner of Riverside Banquet Halls, said the no-dancing rules and mask mandate have continued to dry up his business as well. “The announcement was great that we are at 100 per cent capacity at our banquet halls, but nothing has really changed with our businesses and our clients — they’re still not booking,” said Ghirra. “With Christmas parties, we typically do about 30 to 35 corporate events a year, but this year we’re down to, like, six — and out of those six, we just got a call last week that, because of the no-dancing and indoor-masking rules, that they’re just going to postpone until next year.” Meanwhile, Connolly is asking the province to make a decision this week on whether dancing will be allowed and the indoor-mask mandate lifted for indoor events so event organizers and staff can plan accordingly for the holiday season.

Ministry of Health pointed to earlier comments made by Dr. Bonnie Henry last week, highlighting her response to dancing not being allowed at live event venues. “We are watching that carefully and I hope to be able to take off more restrictions as we get through the next few months,” Henry had said at last Tuesday’s press conference. Although Connolly said she would prefer if both the indoor-mask mandate and dancing restrictions were lifted, there is one that would allow her businesses to thrive more. “If I had to pick one or the other, I would definitely say let us dance.” © 2021 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.",https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CP127988159.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=720&h=480&crop=1,globalnews

(Theratechnologies) (TSX: TH) (NASDAQ: THTX), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies, is pleased to announce that it has reached an agreement with the Italian Medicines Agency, AIFA, for the reimbursement of Trogarzo ® for eligible people aged 18 and older living with multi-drug resistant (MDR) HIV-1. “This agreement is an important milestone for Trogarzo ® and for HIV-1 patients in Italy,” said Conor Walshe, General Manager, Europe. “Italy is the first country with a universal healthcare plan that has approved the formal reimbursement of Trogarzo ® for all patients in need. We expect to launch Trogarzo ® in Italy during the current quarter and look forward to its wider commercial availability in Europe over the coming months.” Trogarzo ® was first approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2018 and was the first long-acting agent approved for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in heavily treatment-experienced adults with MDR HIV-1 infection failing their current antiretroviral regimen. Trogarzo ® was approved by the European Medical Agency (EMA) in September 2019 for the treatment of adults infected with MDR HIV-1 for whom it is otherwise not possible to construct a suppressive antiviral regimen and is also commercially available in Germany. A number of patients are also being treated with Trogarzo ® in other European countries through early access programs. Theratechnologies plans to launch Trogarzo ® on a country-by-country basis across Europe as it gains reimbursement in each individual country. In addition, the Company received regulatory approval in Israel for Trogarzo ® and is working to secure pricing and reimbursement. About Trogarzo ® 1 Trogarzo ® a humanized monoclonal antibody of immunoglobulin G type 4 (IgG4), is a CD4 domain 2-directed HIV-1 inhibitor. Trogarzo ® blocks HIV-1 from infecting CD4+ T cells by binding to domain 2 of CD4 and interfering with the post-attachment steps required for the entry of HIV-1 virus particles into host cells and preventing the viral transmission that occurs via cell-cell fusion. Trogarzo ® is administered every 2 weeks via intravenous infusion. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were rash (9.2%), diarrhea (3.9%), dizziness (3.9%), headache (3.9%), nausea (3.9%), fatigue (2.0%) and vomiting (2.0%).

How to support a person with dementia as lockdowns ease,https://theconversation.com/how-to-support-a-person-with-dementia-as-lockdowns-ease-169462,,"['Lee-Fay Low', ' Professor in Ageing and Health', ' University of Sydney']",,,"ShutterstockLockdowns lasting months in some states have seen tight restrictions on visitors to nursing homes. So as lockdowns ease, and if you’re vaccinated, you might be planning a happy reunion with your friend or family. If your loved one has dementia, you might be wondering if their symptoms have worsened in lockdown, or if they remember who you are. Here’s what to look out for on your first visit after lockdowns end, and how to support your loved one after that. Read more: Why people with dementia don't all behave the same Expect some decline Lockdowns can result in decline in people with dementia, particularly those living in nursing homes. Research from lockdowns in 2020 showed people with dementia had more trouble thinking and problem solving. Their behaviour and mood worsened. Some studies showed people were less able to do things around the home or look after themselves. Keeping mentally, physically and socially active helps people with dementia maintain their brain and thinking. But in lockdown, when people with dementia did less, they exercised their brains and bodies less. Read more: How best to celebrate Christmas with a person with dementia Lockdowns not only meant a ban on visitors to nursing homes, but limited stimulation from group activities, such as concerts, visits from schools and bus outings. During lockdowns, nursing home residents (more than half have dementia) also got worse in terms of their thinking and well-being. Residents sometimes didn’t understand why they couldn’t move freely around the nursing home, and why their loved ones had stopped visiting. This led to increases in behaviours, such as agitation. After lockdowns began, there has been an increase in prescriptions of psychotropic medications reported internationally. These medications are used in nursing homes to manage behaviours such as aggression and agitation. The first visit can be difficult Some families might be worried about their first visit in several months to a person living with dementia. They might be concerned their loved one has gotten worse, or scared they won’t recognise them. But it may help to think of visits as providing really important mental stimulation and human connection for your loved one, even though visits might be difficult emotionally for you. Introduce yourself: “Hi Dad, it’s Ali”, if it looks like your loved one can’t quite place who you are or your name. Read their reactions to you. If they need time to warm up to you (which might be disappointing if you are close), chat with someone else who is there. The person might enjoy your company even if they aren’t actively participating in the conversation at first. Prepare an activity to do together, based on their interests. Shutterstock Then invite them to participate in the conversation by asking them their opinion: “How is the dog going?” or “I’m looking forward to going to the hairdresser, how about you?”. Prepare an activity to do together based on their interests. You could walk in the garden, browse a magazine about the royal family, sing along to a favourite album. If it’s a noisy gathering, find a quiet spot for one-on-one conversation, as the person may have trouble focusing when there are several people talking at once. Read more: Five tips on how to talk to kids about dementia Let them know when you’ll be back Because of your long separation, your loved one might be quite emotional or clingy when you are leaving. Let them know when you’ll be coming again. You can write this down in their calendar, or on a card to give them. You can also tell the nursing home staff so they can remind them. You can also leave a visual reminder of your visit. This could be a card or photograph, or some flowers with a note. If possible, get back into a visiting routine. You could leave some flowers and card as a physical reminder of your visit. Shutterstock If you notice a decline Families are more likely to notice small or marked changes in their loved one’s abilities if they have not seen them for several months. That might mean noticing early signs of dementia or worsening symptoms if they’ve already been diagnosed with it. So this can be a delicate conversation to have with your loved one. Many people can be defensive or in denial about changes, put it down to “old age”, and are afraid about having dementia. You might need to have the conversation several times to get them to see the doctor. Call the National Dementia Helpline on 1800 100 500 for advice. Read more: How to check if your mum or dad's nursing home is up to scratch In the longer term, consider rehab Rehabilitation helps people with dementia. So it’s worth looking into what support services your loved one might need. A psychologist can help with strategies to manage memory and thinking; an occupational therapist can help with doing day-to-day things around the house; an exercise physiologist or physiotherapist can help with mobility; and a speech pathologist can help with communication. Family carers can talk to their loved one’s dementia specialist, or ask their GP for a Chronic Disease Management Plan for some subsidised rehabilitation sessions. If you’re not the main carer If you’re not the main family carer, make sure that person has some support. Ask how they are feeling and what support you can offer. Carers have been providing more help during lockdowns to people with dementia living in the community. That’s because there have been fewer services on offer, and as people with dementia needed help to comply with restrictions. Offer to spend some time with the person with dementia so the carer can have a break. Or take the carer out for a meal and some social time now restrictions have eased.

"Walmart recalls room spray for ""rare and dangerous"" bacteria",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/deadly-bacteria-room-spray-walmart-recall/,,,,CDC urges consumers not to even open recalled bottles and use gloves in returning them to the retailer.,,2021-10-25 12:13:20,"Walmart is recalling room spray sold nationwide due to the possible presence of what federal regulators called a ""rare and dangerous"" bacteria that is linked to two deaths, including a child. The retailer sold about 3,900 bottles of Better Homes and Gardens-branded-Essential Oil Infused Aromatherapy Room Spray with Gemstones in six different scents, according to a recall notice posted Friday by the Consumer Protection Safety Commission. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tested a sample of the product this week and found it contained the bacteria Burkholderia pseudomallei, which causes melioidosis, a rare but serious disease with about a dozen cases reportedly annually in the U.S. The recall comes two months after the CDC warned the bacterial disease had caused two deaths and urged doctors to be on the lookout for more cases. Consumers are urged not to use — or even open — the recalled spray. Instead, they are advised to wear gloves and double bag the bottles in zip-top clear resealable bags, which should be placed in a small cardboard box and returned to a Walmart store for a refund. The company is also offering a $20 Walmart gift card for customers who return the product. Any surfaces or fabrics that may have been sprayed with the product would be wiped down or washed. The five-ounce glass bottles of room spray retailed for about $4 each, and were sold in in about 55 stores and online from February through October. One of six scents of aromatherapy room spray recalled by Walmart. U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Walmart has stopped selling the product, which was made in India and sold with a pump spray nozzle in the following scents and product numbers: 84140411420 Better Homes and Gardens (BHG) Gem Room Spray Lavender & Chamomile 84140411421 Better Homes and Gardens (BHG) Gem Room Spray Lemon and Mandarin 84140411422 Better Homes and Gardens (BHG) Gem Room Spray Lavender 84140411423 Better Homes and Gardens (BHG) Gem Room Spray Peppermint 84140411424 Better Homes and Gardens (BHG) Gem Room Spray Lime & Eucalyptus 84140411425 Better Homes and Gardens (BHG) Gem Room Spray Sandalwood and Vanilla Most cases of melioidosis occur in people who live in or have traveled to areas where the bacteria naturally occurs, such as parts of Asia and Australia, as well as occasionally in Brazil, Mexico and Puerto Rico. It causes a wide range of symptoms that can be confused with other common illnesses, like flu or a cold, according to the CDC. The bacteria detected in the bottles is the same type that sickened four people earlier this year, with one of the recalled sprays found October 6 in the home of a Georgia resident stricken with melioidosis in late July, according to the agency. The CDC is conducting tests to determine if the genetic fingerprint of the bacteria in the bottle matches those found in three other patients, the agency said Friday in a statement . ""Our hearts go out to the families that have been impacted by this situation,"" Dr. Inger Damon, director of CDC's division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, which manages melioidosis, said in a statement. ""Our scientists have continued to work tirelessly to try to find the potential source for the melioidosis infections in these patients. We hope this work can help protect other people who may have used this spray."" Walmart issued a separate statement late Friday. ""We are deeply concerned that there may be a connection between this product and this rare bacteria. Our sympathies and concerns are with the four families that have been impacted. We took immediate action after federal agencies alerted us Wednesday of concerns with an aromatherapy room spray manufactured by Flora Classique Inc. and sold under the Better Homes & Gardens brand. We pulled the product from the shelves of about 55 stores where it was part of a pilot program and put a register block in place at our stores and online to prevent any further sales."" The company also reiterated the importance of handling the products safely and returning to Walmart. The U.S. Department of Defense in June awarded a $3 million contract to the University of Hawaii at Manoa's School of Life Sciences to develop a vaccine for melioidosis, which experts say can be a potential bioterrorism threat.

"AY.4.2 up to 15 per cent more transmissible than Delta, may be named ‘Nu’",https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/health/ay-4-2-up-to-15-per-cent-more-transmissible-than-delta-may-be-named-nu-329006,,,,"London, October 24 A sub-variant of the Covid Delta strain—AY.4.2 -- may be up to 15 per cent more transmissible than the original Delta, scientists estimate. AY.4.2 made up almost 10 per cent of all infections in England in the fortnight ending October 9, the Daily Mail reported. Its prevalence in England doubled in a month from being behind four per cent of cases in September to 8.9 per cent in the two weeks to October 9, said scientists at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. AY.4.2, which is one of 45 sub-lineages of Delta and dubbed by many as Delta plus, is likely to be named as Nu, the report said. The strain could be the most infectious subvariant seen since the pandemic began, Professor Francois Balloux, director of the University College London Genetics Institute, was quoted as saying to the Financial Times. The World Health Organisation will likely elevate AY.4.2 to a ""variant under investigation"", which means it would be given a name under its Greek letter naming system, Balloux added. However, he noted that since the UK is the only country where the sub-lineage has ""taken off"", its quick growth could also be a ""chance demographic event"". ""The emergence of yet another more transmissible strain would be suboptimal. Though, this is not a situation comparable to the emergence of Alpha and Delta that were far more transmissible -- 50 per cent or more—than any strain in circulation at the time,"" Balloux said. ""Here we are dealing with a potential small increase in transmissibility that would not have a comparable impact on the pandemic."" The UK has recorded about 50,000 new Covid infections, marking another three-month high. Hospitalisations and deaths are also on the rise. According to the latest weekly report from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA)—which has replaced Public Health England—revealed Covid cases have risen in all age groups, but are now at a record high among school children. AY.4.2 has spread to all but two dozen places in the country. Some experts have said the subvariant may be behind the surge in cases in the UK, which other European countries are not seeing to the same extent. However, there is yet no evidence that AY.4.2 is more deadly than earlier versions of the Delta strain, which was first identified in India last December, the Daily Mail report said. It includes two mutations—called Y145H and A222V—and is being monitored, the UKHSA said. Both of these spike mutations have been found in other virus lineages since the pandemic began—but are not present on any current variant of concern. — IANS",,2021-10-24 11:40:06,,https://englishtribuneimages.blob.core.windows.net/gallary-content/2021/10/2021_10$largeimg_1281351769.jpeg,tribuneindia
Moderna says its low-dose COVID vaccine works for kids 6 to 11,https://abc13.com/moderna-vaccine-for-kids-who-has-near-me-costco-booster-covid/11166164/,"['moderna vaccine for kids', 'who has moderna vaccine near me', 'costco moderna booster', 'moderna covid vaccine', 'moderna expiration date', 'why is moderna booster half dose']",['AP'],,"Moderna said half-dose shots induced strong levels of virus-fighting antibodies in youngsters, with temporary side effects such as fever and fatigue.",,2021-10-25 16:10:58,"Moderna said Monday that a low dose of its COVID-19 vaccine is safe and appears to work in 6- to 11-year-olds, as the manufacturer moves toward expanding shots to children. Competitor Pfizer's kid-sized vaccine doses are closer to widespread use, undergoing evaluation by the Food and Drug Administration for nearly the same age group - starting at age 5. Its vaccine already is authorized for anyone 12 or older. Moderna hasn't yet gotten the nod to offer its vaccine to teens but is studying lower doses in younger children while it waits. Researchers tested two shots for the 6- to 11-year-olds, given a month apart, that each contained half the dose given to adults. Preliminary results showed vaccinated kids developed virus-fighting antibodies similar to levels that young adults produce after full-strength shots, Moderna said in a press release. The study included 4,753 kids ages 6 to 11, who got either the vaccine or dummy shots. Moderna said that like adults, the vaccinated youngsters had temporary side effects including fatigue, headache, fever and injection site pain. The study was too small to spot any extremely rare side effects, such as heart inflammation that sometimes occurs after either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines, mostly among young men. Moderna said it plans to submit its pediatric data to the FDA and global regulators soon. The FDA hasn't yet ruled on the company's application to expand its vaccinations to 12- to 17-year-olds, although some countries have cleared Moderna's shots for adolescents. But the U.S. is expected to begin vaccinating kids under 12 sometime next month, if the FDA clears small doses of the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine for 5- to 11-year-olds. Pfizer reported last week that its kid-sized doses proved nearly 91% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 in the younger age group, even as the extra-contagious delta variant was spreading widely. FDA's advisers will deliberate Pfizer's evidence in a public meeting Tuesday. If the agency authorizes Pfizer's kid shots, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the following week is set to recommend who should receive them.",,abc13

Stockton triathlon joins Newcastle events list for 2022,https://www.newcastleherald.com.au/story/7480600/stockton-triathlon-joins-newcastle-events-list-for-2022/?src=rss,,['Renee Valentine'],,It will be staged next February.,,2021-10-24 22:30:00,"Event-starved Novocastrians may have been celebrating last week with news of a new running race for the community calendar. I use the word race loosely because for many it will merely be a chance to test themselves after months of lockdown and a barren stretch of cancelled event after cancelled event. Signing up for a fitness event is a fantastic way to add some motivation to your training program. It gives you a clear goal and time frame to work with. You can gradually increase your training workload over time to the distance you have entered. For first-timers this may be geared around just completing the course. For the more experienced a personal best time might be the focus. H Events announced last week they would host Recovery Run Newcastle around the harbour foreshore on November 14. Distances on offer are five kilometres and 10km but entrants must be double vaccinated against coronavirus. The course is flat and a good entry point for those who may have taken up running or walking during lockdown life. You could test yourself on the flat then look for a further challenge in the new year with NewRun's Herald Hill2Harbour 10km on April 3 next year. Recovery Run Newcastle is not the only new event to hit the city's shores. H Events will also stage a triathlon, to be supported by City of Newcastle, at Stockton in February next year. The annual Sparke Helmore Newcastle City Tri around the Newcastle harbour foreshore is usually held in February but has been rescheduled until November next year. H Events director Paul Humphreys said the move opened up the opportunity to offer a triathlon in Stockton in February instead. The Stockton event will be held over three days from February 4 to 6, starting with a fun run on the Friday evening, an aquathlon (swim and run) on the Saturday morning and two triathlon events on the Sunday. They will be a sprint distance course of 750-metre swim, 20km bike and 5km run, and an Olympic course with all distances doubled. ""We're making it a three-day festival,"" Mr Humphreys said. ""It's a flat course, so the sprint distance should suit novices, but there is something for all levels."" Flat means fast for the diehards as well as a comfortable introduction to triathlon for beginners. The beauty of triathlon events is that you can do them solo or in a team. My first triathlon was as part of a team with a work colleague. I did the swim and run leg with a welcome rest in between cheering him through the bike leg. It gave me the confidence to go back the following couple of years and try the full event on my own, albeit the shortest course available. It is just over three months away, which provides ample time to train up for the swim, cycle or run, or perhaps all three. Send your health and fitness news to r.valentine@newcastleherald.com.au.

Can I get a booster shot? Latest guidelines for COVID-19 vaccines,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-vaccine-booster-shots-pfizer-moderna-johnson-and-johnson/,,,,"The CDC recently recommended additional doses for millions of Americans, including all adults who were first vaccinated with Johnson & Johnson's shot.",,2021-10-25 18:37:22,"Up to 99 million Americans are now eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine booster shot, after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week signed off on sweeping new booster recommendations for recipients of Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson's vaccines . Those recommendations came after the Food and Drug Administration updated their emergency use authorizations to allow boosters for all three vaccines. The FDA is also allowing eligible Americans to mix-and-match their booster shots, which means you can choose to receive an additional dose from any of the three brands that are available. Here's what we know so far: Johnson & Johnson recipients The CDC now recommends a booster shot for all adults who were vaccinated with Johnson & Johnson's Janssen COVID-19 vaccine at least two months ago. That comes after the FDA concluded that even the highest estimates of the single-shot vaccine's protection were ""consistently less"" than the mRNA-based vaccines from Pfizer or Moderna. Data presented to the FDA's outside vaccine advisers by Johnson & Johnson says vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic COVID-19 climbed to 94% in the U.S. after a booster shot. A group of the CDC's vaccine advisers also concluded that the risks of rare but serious side effects following a second dose of the vaccine were ""unlikely to be greater"" than after the first dose. However, some of the agency's outside vaccine advisers said they would probably counsel their patients at higher risk of a rare blood clotting side effect linked to the Janssen vaccine to opt for a dose of Pfizer or Moderna instead. Out of more than 15 million recipients in the U.S. of Johnson & Johnson's vaccine, the CDC and FDA have confirmed close to 50 reports of the condition known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome. Most were women under 50 years old. ""I was personally not going to recommend a booster dose of the same product of Janssen, so I'm glad that we have included the mix-and-match,"" Dr. Pablo Sanchez, one of the CDC's vaccine advisers, said last week at the committee's meeting to discuss booster shots. Pfizer and Moderna recipients Currently, all seniors 65 and older who received Pfizer or Moderna's COVID-19 vaccines are recommended to get a booster shot at least six months after they were first vaccinated. The CDC also expanded eligibility for adults ages 18 and up who were vaccinated six months ago if they live in ""long-term care settings,"" have ""underlying medical conditions,"" or are working or living in ""high-risk settings"" like prisons, hospitals or homeless shelters. People at higher risk of exposure from their jobs — including teachers and school support staff, grocery clerks, postal workers, factory workers, public transit crews, police and first responders, and others — are also eligible. Like with earlier booster shot recommendations for immunocompromised recipients , most pharmacies and providers are relying only on people's ""self-attestation"" and not requiring proof of eligibility for the additional shots. FDA and CDC officials say they could further expand eligibility for booster shots soon as authorities gather more data on the need and potential risks. ""There is evidence to suggest potentially that lowering the age of those eligible for boosters may make sense in the future. Something we're looking at closely,"" Dr. Peter Marks, the FDA's top vaccines official, told reporters last week. Those risks include myocarditis and pericarditis, rare heart side effects linked to the mRNA-based Pfizer and Moderna vaccines that have occurred mostly in young males. These cases have been mostly mild and typically resolve within a day, according to federal health officials, but often require hospitalization. Data presented to the CDC's outside vaccine advisers last week suggested the risk of myocarditis could be ""slightly increased"" in adults under 30 after Moderna's first two doses compared to Pfizer's. However, some experts hope Moderna's decision to halve the size of its booster dose — 50 micrograms instead of the 100 micrograms of its first two shots — could cut the risk of myocarditis after the booster. Data from Pfizer's booster rollout in Israel, which was presented to the FDA's vaccine advisers earlier this month , also suggests the risk of myocarditis was lower after the third dose while effectively curbing a surge in COVID-19 cases there. ""We may well get there. It's a matter of having the data, and ensuring that when we make that decision, the benefits clearly outweigh the risks throughout the population,"" Marks said. Mix-and-match boosters The FDA's decision to allow for mixing-and-matching booster shots was based in part on early data from trials led by the National Institutes of Health which suggest all combinations of so-called ""heterologous"" boosting are safe and effective at increasing protection. Federal health officials also pointed to situations that made requirements to match booster shot brands tricky, like when people do not remember which shots they were first vaccinated with, had a bad reaction to their initial vaccinations, or do not have access to the same brand at their nearby pharmacies. So far, the FDA's scientists concluded there is not enough data from the NIH's trial to pick a ""preferred strategy"" for boosting. The study's scientists had cautioned that their trial was not designed to ""directly compare"" the immune response triggered by different booster combinations. ""We will not articulate a preference. My understanding is that most people will have done largely well with the initial vaccine that they got and may express a preference, very much, for the original vaccine series they got, having done very well,"" CDC Director Rochelle Walensky told reporters last week . ""There may be some people who might prefer another vaccine over the one that they received, and the current CDC recommendations now make that possible.""

Do you have trouble sleeping?

It began with a workplace visit from a sleep consultant. “I suddenly realised I knew nothing about sleep and decided to start learning,” smiles the Dublin mum-of-one. “I became a bit sleep obsessed.” B ut the reason behind the obsession was personal — Sine couldn’t sleep and soon realised several factors were at play. “It was a combination of recurrent miscarriages and high stress in my job,” explains Sine, who worked in tech at the time. “I wasn’t sleeping and initially I thought, ‘I’ll just have to get on with it’, but when I started learning about how badly lack of sleep could impact my health, I decided I needed to change. I needed to solve this problem.” She now believes she has cracked the issue, with a new product that she hopes can also change other sleep-deprived lives. Sleep is something many of us struggle with. Only 20pc of Irish people believe they’re getting enough sleep and, in a poll of 14 countries, Ireland ranked second only to the UK for reports of bad sleep. Sine then left her job. The move was primarily motivated by a desire to spend more time with her six-year-old daughter, but the mental space freed up by leaving work gave her the opportunity to pursue a new endeavour. She set up Siest Sleep, a sleep solutions business that has created a weighted ‘sleeper’ — a unique pillow, hand-made in Ireland, that aims to help with a host of sleep problems. Weighted blankets have been around for a while but weighted pillows like the Siest sleeper range are something new to the Irish market. “It’s the first weighted pillow so it’s currently going through the patent process at the moment,” reveals Sine. “I find weighted blankets claustrophobic and too hot, and my husband didn’t like them either. I wanted something you could hug and that’s how the weighted sleeper is different.” There’s something very primal about the power of hugging. “When you get a hug from someone you care about, it makes your heartbeat naturally slow down,” explains Sine. “The pillows give that calming feel of someone holding you and comforting you. The concept is that if you feel hugged, it can calm your mind, relax, and that might help you sleep better.” Expand Close The weighted pillow which is part of the Siest sleeper range / Facebook Twitter Email Whatsapp The weighted pillow which is part of the Siest sleeper range Home & Property Get the best home, property and gardening stories straight to your inbox every Saturday. Enter email address This field is required Sign Up We also all know the joy of turning over to the cool side of the pillow, but creating her weighted sleepers using tencel, a cooling, sustainable plant-made fabric that doesn’t get hot and sticky, was something particularly important to Sine. Before getting pregnant with her daughter she suffered a miscarriage and went on to have five other miscarriages in the years after. The experience of loss isn’t something she wants to be defined by, but she does see it as an important driver in founding Siest Sleep. “That was what motivated me,” she explains. “Literally not sleeping as a result of stress and miscarriages. I thought, ‘this can’t be good for me’ and the more I learned about sleep, the more important it became that I found solutions to my sleep.” The hormonal night sweats she experienced relating to miscarriage were a revelation to her. “I know firsthand that when you’re going through something like that, you need something that helps with the sweating,” she says. “Miscarriages can make you have a lot of really hot night sweats — the same with peri-menopause and menopause — and you just feel anxious. “I wanted to make something you could hug and feel emotionally comforted by, something that was super simple because when you’re emotional you don’t have the brain power for anything complicated. You just want something that works quickly to calm you down and also something that would remain cooling and fresh.” She now sleeps nightly with a weighted pillow, as does her daughter. It is, she believes, a ‘universal product’, with customer ages ranging from as young as five, to a growing presence in nursing homes across the country. Parents are buying them for teens battling pandemic-related anxiety while a key demographic is women over 35 who, like Sine, have struggled with stress-related sleeplessness but feel reluctant to go down the route of medication or tech solutions. The Siest Sleep website lists an impressive range of complaints where the pillow can help: easing hip discomfort when used between the knees, helping tummy pains from PMS and combating snoring if placed behind the back. There has also been a wealth of glowing testimonies. “It’s not a medical device and it doesn’t claim to be,” says Sine. But she’s fascinated by health issues such as the link between snoring, sleep apnoea and its under-diagnosis in women. Studies have shown that men are twice as likely to get referred for sleep studies than women, and that sleep apnoea is undiagnosed in more than 90pc of women suffering from it. Read More Snooze reset: How to fall back to sleep after waking in the wee small hours Losing sleep – insomnia epidemic being driven by pandemic Women are more likely to report symptoms of poor sleep relating to sleep apnoea, such as daytime fatigue, headaches and depression, and be treated for those issues rather than what could be at the root of them, with one reason being the social stigma that persists around women snoring. “To me that’s another driving force into why I’m so interested in focusing on women and improving women’s sleep,” says Sine. “I think for women especially, poor sleep is often seen as something you just have to get through and the problems with sleep aren’t always instantly linked to sleep.” When Siest Sleep launched in January this year, the initial €30,000 investment came from personal equity and Kickstarter. Those involved in the Kickstarter fundraiser have also helped to provide product feedback which, alongside Sine’s own experience, her engagement with sleep consultants and information garnered from medical journals, informs the design process. But, with a background in strategy, operations and sales, Sine is keen to put more evidence-based research behind her product. She’s currently working on an innovation study with Trinity College’s Centre for Health Services, looking at weighted products and children with additional sensory need. “I love data so I’m taking feedback I’ve got from customers and putting more rigour behind it,” says Sine. The links between mental health problems and poor sleep are increasingly being investigated, with research now suggesting it might be a case of causation rather than correlation between the two. In 2017, the Get Better Sleep study at the University of Oxford concluded that how well we sleep may play a role in our mental health. According to the lead author, Daniel Freeman, professor of clinical psychology: “If you can sort out your sleep, you also could be taking a significant step forward in tackling a wide range of psychological and emotional problems.” It’s a link that Sine feels passionately about and 10pc of the profits from Siest sales are pledged to mental health charities. She’s aware that some people might baulk at the price of her pillows, €179 for the 1.5kg Lollypop length and €219 for the longer Wishbone shape weighing 2.5kg. “But if you buy two silk pillow cases that’s the same price and what you’re getting with a sleeper is a product that actually helps you sleep,” she explains. It’s also a product handmade in Ireland, predominantly with sustainable products, with free shipping and a 30-day trial. It might look like just a pretty pillow but there’s more to it than that, says Sine. “That’s the exciting thing about innovation,” she says. “It’s usually something that everyone goes, ‘why didn’t that exist before?’ and that’s why it’s proving to be so popular.” For information check out siestsleep.com Read More Expert tips and tricks to get a great night's sleep",https://www.independent.ie/life/health-wellbeing/health-features/ba974/40975996.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/st_Sine%20Dunne%20Beach,independent
How to support a person with dementia as lockdowns ease,https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-10-person-dementia-lockdowns-ease.html,['Health'],,,"Lockdowns lasting months in some states have seen tight restrictions on visitors to nursing homes. So as lockdowns ease, and if you're vaccinated, you might be planning a happy reunion with your friend or family.",,2021-10-25 13:42:05,"Lockdowns lasting months in some states have seen tight restrictions on visitors to nursing homes. So as lockdowns ease, and if you're vaccinated, you might be planning a happy reunion with your friend or family. If your loved one has dementia , you might be wondering if their symptoms have worsened in lockdown , or if they remember who you are. Here's what to look out for on your first visit after lockdowns end, and how to support your loved one after that. Expect some decline Lockdowns can result in decline in people with dementia, particularly those living in nursing homes. Research from lockdowns in 2020 showed people with dementia had more trouble thinking and problem solving. Their behavior and mood worsened. Some studies showed people were less able to do things around the home or look after themselves. Keeping mentally, physically and socially active helps people with dementia maintain their brain and thinking. But in lockdown, when people with dementia did less, they exercised their brains and bodies less. Lockdowns not only meant a ban on visitors to nursing homes, but limited stimulation from group activities, such as concerts, visits from schools and bus outings. During lockdowns, nursing home residents ( more than half have dementia) also got worse in terms of their thinking and well-being . Residents sometimes didn't understand why they couldn't move freely around the nursing home, and why their loved ones had stopped visiting. This led to increases in behaviors, such as agitation. After lockdowns began, there has been an increase in prescriptions of psychotropic medications reported internationally. These medications are used in nursing homes to manage behaviors such as aggression and agitation. The first visit can be difficult Some families might be worried about their first visit in several months to a person living with dementia. They might be concerned their loved one has gotten worse, or scared they won't recognize them. But it may help to think of visits as providing really important mental stimulation and human connection for your loved one, even though visits might be difficult emotionally for you. Introduce yourself: ""Hi Dad, it's Ali,"" if it looks like your loved one can't quite place who you are or your name. Read their reactions to you. If they need time to warm up to you (which might be disappointing if you are close), chat with someone else who is there. The person might enjoy your company even if they aren't actively participating in the conversation at first. Then invite them to participate in the conversation by asking them their opinion: ""How is the dog going?"" or ""I'm looking forward to going to the hairdresser, how about you?"". Prepare an activity to do together based on their interests. You could walk in the garden, browse a magazine about the royal family , sing along to a favorite album. If it's a noisy gathering, find a quiet spot for one-on-one conversation, as the person may have trouble focusing when there are several people talking at once. Let them know when you'll be back Because of your long separation, your loved one might be quite emotional or clingy when you are leaving. Let them know when you'll be coming again. You can write this down in their calendar, or on a card to give them. You can also tell the nursing home staff so they can remind them. You can also leave a visual reminder of your visit. This could be a card or photograph, or some flowers with a note. If possible, get back into a visiting routine. If you notice a decline Families are more likely to notice small or marked changes in their loved one's abilities if they have not seen them for several months. That might mean noticing early signs of dementia or worsening symptoms if they've already been diagnosed with it. So this can be a delicate conversation to have with your loved one. Many people can be defensive or in denial about changes, put it down to ""old age,"" and are afraid about having dementia. You might need to have the conversation several times to get them to see the doctor. Call the National Dementia Helpline on 1800 100 500 for advice. In the longer term, consider rehab Rehabilitation helps people with dementia. So it's worth looking into what support services your loved one might need. A psychologist can help with strategies to manage memory and thinking ; an occupational therapist can help with doing day-to-day things around the house ; an exercise physiologist or physiotherapist can help with mobility; and a speech pathologist can help with communication . Family carers can talk to their loved one's dementia specialist, or ask their GP for a Chronic Disease Management Plan for some subsidized rehabilitation sessions. If you're not the main carer If you're not the main family carer, make sure that person has some support. Ask how they are feeling and what support you can offer. Carers have been providing more help during lockdowns to people with dementia living in the community. That's because there have been fewer services on offer, and as people with dementia needed help to comply with restrictions. Offer to spend some time with the person with dementia so the carer can have a break. Or take the carer out for a meal and some social time now restrictions have eased.

Invested in collaborative study to enable expanded Breast Cancer risk testing for populations of African American descent addressing underlying and underserved need to include diverse population studies within risk testing protocols and applications Published peer-reviewed paper titled “Ability of known colorectal cancer susceptibility SNPs to predict colorectal cancer risk: A cohort study within the UK Biobank” Gafni A, Dite GS, Spaeth Tuff E, Allman R, Hopper JL (2021) on PLoS Strong cash balance of A$15.7 million providing 24 months of runway post the integration and revenue contribution from EasyDNA Net cash used for operations of A$1.9 million, due mainly to the increase in R&D and operating expenses as the Company executes on its commercialisation strategy Genetic Technologies is in a strong position with a portfolio of high-quality products in the market and under development and a substantial international platform for the distribution of the Direct-to-Consumer product base via EasyDNA. Over the quarter, the Company has continued to invest in its product development through the self-funded study in collaboration with the Institute of Public Health in St Louis, and continued progress with the Multi-Test with the post period end completion of the validation pack which has been submitted to NATA for approval. This is one of the final steps prior to commercial release of the test. Commenting on the quarter, CEO Simon Morriss stated: “This past quarter demonstrates the forward trajectory and momentum Genetic Technologies has established. We have built our product roadmap and our deliverables and are now positioned to execute on driving sales and product awareness in the months and years ahead. With the acquisition of EasyDNA we can fast track consumer awareness of our product portfolio with the ability to include consumer-initiated testing products on these platforms, subject to local jurisdictions restrictions and requirements. “We continue to innovate and have engaged with a number of notable institutions over the quarter which will pay rewards in the coming periods as we nurture these initiatives and relationships. Additionally, we are pleased to report the delivery of our preliminary revenue generation from the acquisition of EasyDNA contributing A$850k in customer receipts for the quarter. Alongside the established relationship with IBX we are confident that we are well resourced and appropriately positioned to drive forward with our objectives. We continue to demonstrate our transition from a pure R&D company to execute on commercialisation and deliver revenue growth in the coming periods.” Commercialization and Product Overview The Company’s strategy to commence commercialization and enhance the distribution network is well underway. Key avenues for commercialization of launched products currently include the consumer-initiated testing and online sales and marketing platform (CIT) available in Australia and the US. With the recent inclusion of the EasyDNA business the Company intends to leverage this platform to enhance the visibility and awareness of its existing products. Additionally, GENE are engaging in sales via medical professionals for business-to-business (B2B) purposes and direct-to-consumer (DTC) testing requiring no medical supervision for products under consideration including non-medical based genetic and gut microbiome testing, subject to regulatory approval and target market assessment. GENE now have distribution coverage of the Australian and US geographies and have identified Europe and the UK as the next regions the Company intends to enter. The Company is assessing the European CE certification requirements for its products and will update the market on its progress within these regions as further clarity on timing is obtained. An Asian market entry for relevant products will also be assessed in due course. The core products for release include GENE’s geneType for Breast Cancer, geneType for Colorectal Cancer and the COVID-19 Risk Test. The release of the Company’s Multi-Test to cover both Colorectal Cancer and Breast Cancer in addition to Prostate Cancer, Ovarian Cancer, Coronary Artery Disease and Type 2 Diabetes as part of the first phase is on track for release later this calendar year. The three-year co-exclusive licence agreement between IBX and GENE was announced on March 3, 2021 for the production, distribution, sales and marketing of GENE’s COVID-19 Risk Test in the US continues with further discussions underway. This includes discussions on opportunities to expand the products offered and consideration of further geographical opportunities given IBXs extensive network. Research and Publications The Company is pleased to report a further peer-reviewed research publication entitled “Ability of known colorectal cancer susceptibility SNPs to predict colorectal cancer risk: A cohort study within the UK Biobank” Gafni A, Dite GS, Spaeth Tuff E, Allman R, Hopper JL (2021) was published on PLoS. The study describes how the addition of a polygenic risk score to a family history model improves the stratification and discriminatory performance of 10-year and full lifetime risk using a prospective population-based cohort within the UK Biobank. Current screening guidelines in the UK, USA and Australia focus solely on family history and age for risk prediction, even though the vast majority of the population do not have any family history. The results support the view that a combined polygenic risk score and first-degree family history model could be used to improve risk stratified population screening programs. Additionally, GENE have committed to fund a collaborative study with Professor Graham Colditz, Deputy Director of the Institute for Public Health, Washington University in St. Louis. The purpose of the study is to incorporate further research and data on women of African descent to provide expanded testing capabilities for the geneType for Breast Cancer product. Polygenic risk models are required to be validated for use with multiple ethnicities and therefore GENE will be validating samples which have both genotype information and the relevant clinical information to cover this expanded population. This investment will be self-funded by GENE with costs estimated to be A$110k which will be partially offset by an R&D tax rebate estimated to be 43.5% of the costs associated with the study. The initial sample set will contain ~1,000 samples and it is anticipated to require around nine months of research and processing at GENE’s Melbourne laboratory. Professor Colditz is a world-renowned figure in breast cancer epidemiology and risk modelling, with notable genotype datasets on the African American population held by the Institute for Public Health. Given the multi-ethnic landscape (particularly in the USA) in which risk models may be used in clinical practice, it is important to understand how the risk model performs in these populations. The lifetime probability of developing non-hereditary breast cancer is 11.5% (1 in 9) for the African American population in the USA 1 . The Company remains committed to investing in product development and enhancement through continued research and validation through peer-reviewed publications. GENE continues to advance its strategic objective to provide the most comprehensive preventative risk tests for common complex disease. Outlook Commenting on the outlook, Simon Morriss stated: “In one quarter we have transformed the business and are positioned to drive significant revenue growth in the coming months and years. We are only at the beginning of this journey and have the right team, platform and resources to execute on our growth plans. “The challenging operating environment in Australia is coming to a close and we are grateful to be able to start operating on a more wholistic basis and invest in our marketing and sales initiatives globally. We are well placed to relaunch the geneType branding globally ahead of more normal trading conditions allowing us to accelerate our commercialisation plans.” We expect revenue growth in the December 2021 quarter will continue to show a material uplift with the Company scheduled to commercially release its Multi-Test at the end of the calendar year.

He was 59. Tyler's manager said he died peacefully at home in Los Angeles Sunday morning. ""If you met him once you made a friend for life,"" his manager said. He is survived by his wife Jennifer Carno, whom he married in 2017. Tyler was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer in September 2018, he revealed this summer. He said doctors discovered it during a routine physical when he was 56. Tyler was best known for the role of Gunther, the Central Perk barista who had an unrequited crush on Jennifer Aniston's Rachel Greene. But his career also included appearances on other sitcoms, such as ""Just Shoot Me!"" ""Sabrina, the Teenage Witch,"" and ""Scrubs,"" and he even played himself once on ""Episodes"" with Matt LeBlanc. Most recently, he released a spoken-word performance of the poem which was adapted into a short video to raise awareness for the Prostate Cancer Foundation. Donations to the Prostate Cancer Foundation in Tyler's name Last month, Tyler made an appearance via Zoom on the ""Friends: The Reunion"" special. The special, which aired on HBO Max, saw the main cast -- Courteney Cox, David Schwimmer, Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, and Matthew Perry -- revisit some of the biggest on-screen moments and discuss their memories of the show. Asked whether the ""Friends"" cast already knew about his illness, Tyler said the show's producers had been aware ""for a long time"" and that Schwimmer had corresponded with him on Instagram. According to the Mayo Clinic, prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer and the second-biggest cause of cancer death for men in the United States. While some types of prostate cancer grow slowly and may need minimal or even no treatment, others are aggressive and can spread quickly. During an interview with the ""Today"" show this summer, Tyler fought back tears as he said earlier detection is key and that he regretted not listening to ""my wonderful wife."" Tyler urged viewers to ""ask your doctor for a PSA (prostate-specific antigen) test"" next time they go in for an examination or check-up, adding that ""caught early (it is) 99% treatable.""",,abc30

Win McNamee/Getty Images hide caption A nurse draw a Moderna COVID-19 vaccine dose from a vial at the Cameron Grove Community Center in Bowie, Md., in late March. Moderna says study data supports use of a half-dose of the vaccine in children 6 to 11. Moderna says a study in kids 6 to 11 found two doses of the company's COVID-19 vaccine given 28 days apart produced a strong antibody response. The study, conducted in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health, used shots containing a 50 microgram dose of the vaccine, half the dose of the Moderna shots authorized for adults. More than 4,700 children ages 5 to 11 took part in the study. The most common side effects were fatigue, headache, fever and pain at the site of injection. The company says the analysis showed a ""favorable safety profile."" The summary of the study results was made available in a press release . The information hasn't been peer reviewed or published, but Moderna said it plans to submit them to a scientific journal for publication. The company also said it plans to submit the data to regulators, a move that would support the authorization of the vaccine for kids 6 to 11. The release of the data comes a day before a panel of advisers to the Food and Drug Administration will review use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in children 5 to 11 years of age. In June, Moderna submitted study results involving nearly 2,500 adolescents ages 12 to 15 to the FDA. The agency hasn't yet issued a decision on whether to expand use of the Moderna vaccine to that age group. In May, the FDA expanded authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to include adolescents 12 to 15 years of age.",,npr

How did California go from COVID-19 epicenter to lowest statewide transmission rate?,https://abc13.com/california-covid-19-infection-rate-vaccination-requirements-vaccine-mandates/11165638/,"['california covid-19', 'infection rate', 'vaccination requirements', 'vaccine mandates', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'CDC', 'moderate rate', 'substantial rate', '']",['ABCNews'],https://vcl.abcotv.net/video/wpvi/102521-wpvi-covid-vaccine-GMA-vid.mp4,"""We can't know for sure which factors are responsible,"" an epidemiologist said, ""but we know that the combination of interventions and policies can play a really strong role in driving transmission.""",,2021-10-25 12:21:01,"LOS ANGELES -- With the lowest COVID-19 infection rate among all states as of Friday, California, which has some of the strictest mask and vaccination mandates in the country, has managed to flip the script as the former U.S. epicenter of the pandemic. ""They've been very much forward-thinking in terms of policies around vaccination requirements and mandates,"" said epidemiologist Dr. John Brownstein, chief innovation officer at Boston Children's Hospital and an ABC News contributor. As of Friday evening, California had an infection rate of 61.1 cases per 100,000 over the past week, according to from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The state was briefly the only to be classified with a ""moderate"" rate of transmission -- 10 to 49.99 cases per 100,000 over seven days -- before it went back up to ""substantial,"" meaning 50 to 99.99 cases per 100,000 over seven days. Over the previous week, Hawaii, Florida, Louisiana, Connecticut, New Jersey, Mississippi, Maryland, Georgia and Washington, D.C., each also reported ""substantial"" rates. A rate of at least 100 cases per 100,000 is labeled as ""high."" Montana, Wyoming, Idaho and Alaska, as of Friday, had the highest rates over the previous seven days, with each above 450 cases per 100,000 people. The U.S. over that span was 150.9. Experts said California's journey from worst to is likely due to a combination of things. ""We can't know for sure which factors are responsible,"" Brownstein added, ""but we know that the combination of interventions and policies can play a really strong role in driving transmission."" More than 70% of California's population has received at least one dose of vaccine, , and the state also leads in total vaccinations administered, roughly 53 million doses. As of Friday, the national average rate was 66.2%. Being the first state to announce a COVID-19 vaccine requirement for schools, California has some of the strictest mandates in the U.S. The state has mandated vaccines for state employees, health care workers, teachers and at large indoor gatherings. ""The more aggressive the vaccination campaign, the better,"" Dr. Todd Ellerin, director of infectious diseases at South Shore Health, told ABC News. Given that vaccines are the most powerful tool we have in curbing the spread of COVID-19, experts said they believe California's emphasis on immunizations has provided big dividends. ""These results show quite clearly that vaccines offer protection for individuals who lack immunity, with important implications for finally ending this pandemic,"" Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, wrote in a Tuesday. Idaho and Wyoming have some of the lowest vaccination rates and the highest transmission rates. All three COVID-19 vaccines available in the U.S. have since shown high effectiveness in preventing death due to COVID-19, and as of Friday, California the lowest death rate in the country, with 0.3 per 100,000 over the previous week. The U.S. average over that span was 2.7 per 100,000. Additionally, experts told ABC News, having endured the harshest waves of infections last winter and the delta surge in July, formerly infected Californians may have acquired antibodies and more of a natural immunity to COVID-19 -- both factors that, in concert with vaccines, could be driving down case numbers. In addition to strict vaccine mandates, California has been unwavering on face-coverings, testing and social distancing policies. ""While California has administered more vaccines than any other state, we have more work to do,"" the California Department of Public Health said in a statement to ABC News. Everyone, regardless of vaccination status, is to wear a mask on public transit, in health care settings and at educational and correctional facilities. Masks are required for all unvaccinated people and recommended for vaccinated people in settings such as theaters, retail stores, restaurants and bars. Despite having a higher vaccination rate than California, states like Vermont are still falling behind on transmission rate rankings, which experts said points to the importance of distancing and masking. Breakthrough cases seen in Vermont can be further explained by its higher proportion of residents 65 and older. shows mobility, or movement in populations, can be a predictor of disease spread, especially via air travel or mass transit. This became evident through the surge of COVID-19 cases the U.S. saw during holiday season. Gov. Gavin Newsom with California residents on Christmas Eve to avoid holiday gatherings at a time when hospitals in the state were under ""unprecedented pressure."" Californian cities a huge surge of cases and hospitalizations following the holidays, although rates have since declined. No stranger to stay-at-home orders, the California government imposed several lockdowns and restrictions to curb the spread of the virus. It celebrated its most recent reopening in mid-June, which replaced 15-month-long public health restrictions with conditions more akin to ""business as usual."" ""In the height of the pandemic, people were locked down, they weren't moving at all, they were staying at home,"" Brownstein told ABC News. ""The more people move around, that's usually an indicator for increased transmission."" The virus has been shown to spread more indoors and with people in close proximity to one another. California's sunny climate means more people spend more time outside. ""When we spend most of our time indoors, that's when transmission is greatest,"" Ellerin said. Added Brownstein: ""More close contacts with people outside your household indoors is what creates additional risk."" This effect is also compounded by the rise in the virus' effective reproductive number during the winter season with research that a drop in temperature encourages virus growth. Compared to many other states, especially as winter draws nearer, California is in ""quite a good spot,"" Brownstein said. ""In all likelihood, the trends that we're seeing are realistic and very much driven by compliance with masking and other interventions, plus the well-covered vaccination strategy in the state.""",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/11165668_102521califmasks.jpg,abc13

Drs. Cynthia Hawkins and Roman Melnyk will receive the funds for their ground-breaking attempt to target high-grade gliomas (HGG). HGGs are aggressive and incurable brain cancers, such as glioblastoma, with an almost 100% fatality rate and no effective treatment. The funds were made available thanks to the generous support from sponsors, including Scotia Wealth Management, Yamana Gold, and Hampton Securities. Drs. Hawkins and Melnyk are developing a potential therapeutic approach that targets the RAS pathway. RAS can become dysregulated, causing cell growth and cell survival of HGGs. Their research aims to create a protein chimera called RRSP-DT that can address all the diverse ways RAS becomes dysregulated, bringing it back to a normal state. The therapy, if successful, could benefit patients diagnosed with pediatric or adult HGGs. ""This funding will allow us to follow up on our exciting early studies suggesting the protein chimera developed in Dr. Melnyk’s lab may be a promising new therapeutic approach to treat high grade gliomas,"" said Dr. Hawkins, neuropathologist and Senior Scientist, Cell Biology at The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) in Toronto. High-grade gliomas are a group that includes various brain cancers, which are particularly aggressive. The estimated two-year survival rate is 20%, despite the current standard of care that includes surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. In addition, these diseases deteriorate the quality of life for patients as they progress. However, research into treatments and technologies to combat these types of cancers is tragically underfunded. Less than 3% of all governmental cancer funding is devoted to brain cancer research. ""We remain strongly committed to supporting the fight against high-grade gliomas by funding research, treatment and technology,"" said Brain Cancer Canada chair Angela Scalisi. ""Our volunteer-based organization has already been able to give full funds to two Canadian research projects this year. We are so proud to support these brilliant scientists who endeavour each day to fight what is without a doubt one of the most lethal diseases we face"" . ""We know the best therapy we have to fight HGGs is still ineffective for the far majority of the patient population,"" said Marc Peeters, Director Partnerships and Stakeholders at Brain Cancer Canada. ""This research opens up new avenues to find better therapies, which both child and adult patients need. We are incredibly grateful to our donors, and we urge our governments to join us in funding research that is in an early stage but promising enough to warrant investment. We need to make bigger bets to achieve life-changing results for those patients who need it so much. It has been 15 years since the last therapy breakthrough, and patients cannot afford another decade-and-a-half of waiting"" .

(NASDAQ: AQST), a pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing differentiated products that address patients’ unmet needs and solve therapeutic problems, today announced positive topline data from its first-in-human Phase 1 PK study of AQST-109 sublingual film for the delivery of epinephrine in the emergency treatment of allergic reactions including anaphylaxis. Findings from this study support AQST-109’s potential as the first orally administered epinephrine treatment for anaphylaxis, with safety, tolerability, PK and pharmacodynamics (PD) measures that fall within the target range of standard of care autoinjectors such as epinephrine pens which require patients or caregivers to inject into their thighs during an emergency allergic reaction. “These findings represent a critical step forward in the development of our product candidate AQST-109 as the first oral product aiming to treat anaphylaxis,” said Keith Kendall, Chief Executive Officer of Aquestive. “The optimized PK/PD profile of our epinephrine prodrug demonstrates that our oral alternative to epinephrine injection can, in fact, match the PK parameters of autoinjectors while lowering barriers to use and improving convenience, ultimately resulting in better, often life-saving outcomes for patients. Based on our review of published literature, AQST-109 is the only non-injection form of epinephrine to achieve a median Tmax of 15 minutes or less. We are encouraged by these findings and continue to believe patients will embrace this needle-free, user-friendly alternative.” AQST-109 is a polymer matrix-based film that can be applied sublingually (under the tongue) for the rapid delivery of epinephrine. The product is similar in size to a postage stamp and begins to dissolve on contact. No water or swallowing is required for administration. The packaging for AQST-109 is thinner and smaller than an average credit card, can be carried in a pocket, and is designed to withstand weather excursions such as exposure to rain and/or sunlight. Current stability data is tracking favorably to support a two-year shelf life. The Phase 1 randomized, single-ascending dose (SAD) study was performed with AQST-109 in order to assess safety, tolerability, PK, and PD profiles. The study was conducted in Canada pursuant to a clinical trial application approved by Health Canada. Subjects participating in the trial received, in ascending fashion, sublingually administered doses of AQST-109 across four different formulations. The four formulation compositions were varied to assess critical absorption factors including drug loading and the use of inventive excipients designed to influence absorption, stability, and the conversion of the prodrug. A target formulation (“formulation #2” highlighted below) was designed as the lead candidate for the study. Study Highlights Key clinical measures for comparability to existing autoinjectors (C max , T max , and area under the curve, or AUC) were within expected ranges for formulations 1, 2 (target), and 4 Observed PD values were comparable to existing data for autoinjectors AQST-109 was generally well tolerated with no serious adverse events Study Results AQST-109 (epinephrine prodrug sublingual film) 12 mg Comparable Data from Previous & Published Studies Film Formulation # 1 2 (Target) 3 4 EpiPen® 1 EpiPen® 2 Auvi-Q® 1 Dosings (n) 6 8 6 7 135 10 67 C max (pg/mL) 552 762 164 307 518 341 484 AUC 0-t (hr*pg/mL) 634 603 329 303 560 328 526 Median T max (minutes) 15 15 20 10 10 22 20 T max range (minutes) 15-25 10-35 20-50 5-50 4-60 5-90 5-60 This study indicated that AQST-109 was absorbed and rapidly converted to epinephrine with an observed median T max of 15 minutes and an observed geometric mean C max of 762 pg/mL for the target formulation. The findings for the target formulation are comparable to published study results for both EpiPen and Auvi-Q 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 . In addition, the target formulation had similar median T max values at lower dose strengths (15 minutes and 17.5 minutes for the 6 mg and 9 mg doses, respectively, included in the study). Based on the study results, Aquestive plans on continuing development of the target formulation to take forward into a pivotal PK study. Safety data indicated that AQST-109 was generally well tolerated with no serious adverse events (SAE’s), significant medical events, or treatment-related severe adverse events reported within the trial. All treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) deemed at least possibly related were mild to moderate in nature across cohorts. The PD markers measured changes from baseline in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure. The changes observed suggest a comparable effect for AQST-109 when compared to autoinjectors in healthy volunteers. David Fleischer, MD, Section Head, Pediatric Allergy and Immunology at Children’s Hospital Colorado, Professor of Pediatrics at University of Colorado School of Medicine, commented, ""An epinephrine delivery solution such as AQST-109 for cases of severe life-threatening allergic reactions could address the most important factor contributing to anaphylaxis fatality: the therapeutic time window. The needle-free, pocket-sized, and temperature safe attributes of this first-of-its-kind orally administered prodrug will make it the preferred choice for parents of children facing these risks.” Aquestive has submitted its request for a pre-investigational new drug (IND) meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and anticipates receiving a written response from the FDA before the end of the year. In parallel, Aquestive is on track to conduct a crossover study using an adaptive design for AQST-109 in Canada beginning in the fourth quarter 2021. It is anticipated that this study will establish a final formulation and dose strength for commercial scale-up. The study will include comparisons to 0.3 mg and 0.5 mg epinephrine intramuscular (IM) manual injection and is anticipated to complete in the first half of 2022. A presentation of the results of the Phase 1 PK study of AQST-109 is available on the events and presentation of the investor section of the Company’s website at https://investors.aquestive.com/events-and-presentations# and has been filed with the SEC on Form 8-K. About Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening systemic allergic reaction, with an estimated incidence of 50 to 112 episodes per 100,000 people per year. The frequency of hospital admissions for anaphylaxis has increased 500-700% in the last 10-15 years. The most common causes of reactions that can include anaphylaxis are medications, foods (such as peanuts), and venom from insect stings. Epinephrine injection is the current standard of treatment intended to reverse the potentially severe manifestation of anaphylaxis, which may include red rash, throat swelling, respiratory problems, gastrointestinal distress and loss of consciousness. About AQST-109 Aquestive Therapeutics is developing a sublingual (SL) film containing a prodrug of epinephrine as an alternative dosage form to epinephrine injection (1 mg/mL). The targeted indication for epinephrine prodrug sublingual film is the same as that for epinephrine injection in the emergency treatment of Type 1 allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Aquestive’s SL film contains a prodrug of epinephrine incorporated into a polymer-based film matrix utilizing its innovative PharmFilm® technology. Prodrugs are generally not active moieties and require biotransformation to the parent compound in vivo to allow for therapeutic activity. Treatment with AQST-109 has been generally well-tolerated, with treatment-emergent adverse events observed thus far being mild to moderate in severity. There have been no serious adverse events observed. About Aquestive Therapeutics Aquestive Therapeutics is a pharmaceutical company that applies innovative technology to solve therapeutic problems and improve medicines for patients. The Company has commercialized one internally-developed proprietary product to date, Sympazan® (clobazam) oral film, has a commercial proprietary product pipeline focused on the treatment of diseases of the central nervous system, or CNS, and other unmet needs, and is developing orally administered complex molecules to provide alternatives to invasively administered standard of care therapies.

Guillain-Barré syndrome is a rare, autoimmune disorder in which a person’s own immune system damages the nerves, causing muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis. GBS can cause symptoms that last for a few weeks to several years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most patients with GBS recover fully, but some have permanent nerve damage. Yahoo News reports that the syndrome was added to the list of potential side effects from the AstraZeneca jab by the European Medicines Agency last month, and now the MHRA has also added it to its list after a review of available data. According to the UK government, GBS is a very rare side effect of the COVID-19 vaccine, noting that it may affect up to one in 10,000 people. “According to reports, a government document revealed that up to 13 October, the MHRA had received 432 reports of the syndrome with the AstraZeneca COVID vaccine, 59 following use of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and four reports connected to the Moderna vaccine. “Health officials maintain that vaccinations are the best way to combat COVID-19, with the government urging anyone who hasn’t had a jab to get one,” Yahoo News reports. Recently, the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency said it recorded 191 serious and 6,555 non-serious adverse effects since the commencement of COVID-19 vaccination. The Executive Director of the Agency, Faisal Shuaib said this at a briefing in Abuja.

The experts said it has become necessary to discourage cultures prohibiting the consumption of snails and okro by breastfeeding mothers, stressing that there is no scientific evidence to back the claim that the nutritious foods make babies drool saliva or cause other health issues. According to the experts, the nutritional value and composition of breast milk are regulated by the nutritional status of the mother. One of the experts, and a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Paediatrics, College of Medicine, University of Lagos, Dr. Beatrice Ezenwa, told PUNCH HealthWise in an exclusive interview that breastfeeding mothers need to eat a nutritious and well-balanced diet. Dr. Ezenwa who is also a Consultant Neonatologist/ Paediatrician with the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Idi-Araba said nursing mothers should eat in moderation and avoid what they noticed consistently do not agree with their babies or themselves. The neonatologist said, “In general, a breastfeeding mother can eat any food. No food is off-limit because a woman is breastfeeding. “The key point is to eat a balanced diet and eat in moderation. Having said that, each baby is different and may react differently to certain foods eaten by the mother which comes out in the breast milk in terms of nutrients and flavor. “Some babies can be very fussy and cranky when their mothers eat very spicy foods. Other babies become sleepy or have disorganised sleep patterns when their mothers consume too much of certain other foods such as alcohol and caffeine. “In some cultures in Nigeria, breastfeeding mothers are prohibited from eating certain nutritious foods such as snails, okro, etc because it will make the baby drool saliva. “Meanwhile others encourage the consumption of more harmful ones such as excessive alcohol intake like palm wine in the name of helping the breast milk to flow. These myths are unfounded and the practices are not good, so should be discouraged,” she added. On the myths about certain foods that mothers consume during breastfeeding that make their babies have constipation, the paediatrician said it is not common for exclusively breastfeeding infants to be constipated. Dr. Ezenwa explained, “Breast milk is considered a natural laxative because of the easily digestible nutrients it contains. “There are many other reasons a baby may be gassy that have nothing to do with the foods the mother has eaten. “Some people believe falsely that eating hot and spicy foods or acidic foods such as citrus fruit and tomatoes may cause ‘gassiness’ in babies, but these are not proven. “Unless you can see a direct relationship between specific foods and the same reaction in the baby every time, there is no need to limit your diet.” The child health expert further stated that it is untrue that consuming egusi soup, fruits, and vegetables during breastfeeding makes babies prone to stooling. According to her, this is not proven, saying, “I can safely say, it is not true.” She, however, said, “A breastfed baby may have an allergy or sensitivity reaction after the mother consumes certain foods or drinks (for example cow’s milk allergy, wheat, corn, eggs, nuts, and fish). “This does not mean that every baby whose mother consumed these foods will have diarrhoea. “People react differently to things. If a breastfeeding baby consistently has diarrhea each time a mother consumes a certain food he should be taken to a hospital for proper evaluation.” The neonatologist advised breastfeeding mothers to eat a well-balanced diet. “Eat in moderation and avoid what you notice consistently do not agree with your baby or yourself. “You also need to eat all types of food common in your culture or environment to help your child develop the taste bud for that food. “Some flavors infants are exposed to through breast milk can influence their food preferences as they grow up,” she said. Also speaking with our correspondent, Assistant Chief Dietician, Ajeromi General Hospital, Ajegunle, Lagos, Olusola Malomo, said, “Cultural beliefs and practices can markedly influence a woman’s pregnancy and childbirth experiences, and may shape a woman’s mothering behaviour. “Dietary intake before and during pregnancy and throughout the lactation period is often influenced by cultural beliefs and practices,” Malomo said. Speaking on some foods that are avoided by pregnant women on the ground of cultural beliefs, the dietician said, “In a recent scientific study, approximately 37 per cent of respondents avoided some foods in pregnancy due to food taboos. “Snail and grasscutter meat were the commonly avoided foods in pregnancy, while eggs were commonly withheld from children under two years old. “Some respondents believed that eating snail and grasscutter meat makes a child sluggish and labour difficult respectively; while some say that starting egg early for a child could predispose them to steal later in life.” Charting the way forward, the dietician called for women’s empowerment and education.

Nearly 200,000 new prostate cancer cases are diagnosed each year in the US with over 1 million biopsies being performed. CLS’s goal is to enable high precision, focal laser ablation of prostate cancer tumors to be performed under local anesthetic in an office setting or clinic as well as hospitals. In June 2021, CLS announced that Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg, Medical faculty in Germany will be evaluating the use of TRANBERG Thermal Therapy system with MRI-US, fusion-guided focal laser ablation therapy in early stage prostate cancer in a 10-patient clinical trial. See published clinical studies . “CLS’s TRANBERG Thermal Therapy System has successfully performed MRI-guided, focal laser ablation treatments for hundreds of patients suffering from early stage prostate cancer,” stated Dan Mogren, acting CEO for CLS. “Recent development improvements of MRI-Ultrasound, fusion-guidance systems have enabled both diagnostic biopsy and other ablation procedures, such as cryoablation, to be effectively performed within a doctor’s office setting. We believe our laser ablation system will function very well and produce excellent results as a focal therapy using the same fused image guidance technology.” The safety and diagnostic accuracy of MRI-US, fusion-guided prostate biopsies is well documented with strong global market growth each year. The workflow for focal laser ablation of prostate tumors is very similar to the one used for biopsy and can potentially be performed also as a follow-on outpatient procedure. High precision, image-guided focal laser ablation performed using the TRANBERG Thermal Therapy System is safe and offers a focal therapy option for treatment of prostate tumors while minimizing side effects and maintaining the patient’s quality of life. High Precision Thermal Therapy System The TRANBERG® |Thermal Therapy System has been developed for image-guided, high-precision soft tissue thermal therapy and ablation procedures. For the US market, the system is configured for CT or MRI-US, fusion image-guided procedures, and can be configured for tissue temperature feedback for precise temperature and ablation control. It includes a desk-top mobile laser unit, innovative non-cooled laser applicators, external tissue temperature probe sensors, and procedure specific accessories. Its non-cooled, laser fiber technology optimizes heat distribution, eliminates the need for external cooling, and helps reduce procedure times. About Clinical Laserthermia Systems Clinical Laserthermia Systems AB (publ) develops and sells the TRANBERG® Thermal Therapy System , including sterile disposables, for minimally invasive treatment of cancer tumors and drug-resistant epilepsy, according to regulatory approvals in the EU and the US. The products are marketed for image-guided laser ablation and for treatment with imILT®, the Company's interstitial laser thermotherapy with potential immunostimulatory effects.

(www.i3biomedical.com) achieves the fastest and most efficient “killing speed” of SARS-CoV-2. TrioMed sets the unequalled standard of superiority in Active protection worldwide. The Virucidal technology developed by i3 BioMedical Inc. was confirmed to deactivate more than 99.9% of SARS-CoV-2 – the virus that causes COVID-19 – on the outer surface of the TrioMed Active Medical products (including mask) in 5 minutes after 8 hours of simulated usage, according to independent virology tests conducted at the University of Toronto. Scientists, led by Professor Scott Gray-Owen of the Department of Molecular Genetics at U of T’s Temerty Faculty of Medicine, used the Faculty’s high-tech containment level three (CL3) lab to test the efficacy of the protective layer of TrioMed Active Medical products. “Our tests confirmed that the TrioMed Active technology deactivates more than 99.9% of SARS-CoV-2 at the fastest current testing time point of 5 minutes when applying the virus after 8 hours of mask use,” says Gray-Owen, who has no affiliation with the company or its employees. “The TrioMed Active material was submitted to an exceptionally demanding protocol for a period of 8 hours at our laboratories representing extreme usage condition for facemask, gowns and similar medical products, prior to being sent to the University,” said Mohammed Belhaj, president of Atlas Pharma inc. (Health Canada registration #102041-A) “For over a decade, the TrioMed Technology has provided the highest level of protection against numerous micro-organisms to users worldwide. For medical antimicrobial products, the parameter of 'speed to kill' is critical to provide true protection: 'killing speed' of 30 minutes to hours does not protect sufficiently the wearer, it means that viruses remain infectious for that entire period of time. Only an antimicrobial 'speed to kill' of maximum 5 min provides a REAL & TRUE protection,” said Pierre Jean Messier, Executive Chairman of i3 BioMedical Inc. TrioMed Active products have been systematically in use and tested against numerous pathogenic bacteria and viruses over the course of 10+ years with the consistent results of killing (deactivating) more than 99.9% in 5 min of all the tested microbes.

(NASDAQ: ATRS) (the “Company”), a specialty pharmaceutical company, today announced that an abstract on XYOSTED ® , a subcutaneous testosterone enanthate injection, was accepted as on oral presentation at the 22 nd Annual Fall Scientific Meeting of SMSNA in Scottsdale, AZ on October 21-24, 2021. The abstract entitled “ Subcutaneous Testosterone Enanthate and the Effect of Body Mass Index on Serum Testosterone in Men with Testosterone Deficiency ” was presented by Martin M. Miner, MD, Men’s Health Center, Miriam Hospital, Providence, RI. The post-hoc analysis evaluated the association between body mass index (“BMI”) and serum total testosterone to assess the pharmacokinetics parameters of XYOSTED ® , a weekly subcutaneous testosterone enanthate treatment, in men with testosterone deficiency and varying BMIs. Dr. Miner concluded that patients with higher BMI may require higher testosterone doses to return serum testosterone to physiological levels. Dr. Peter Richardson, EVP, Research and Development and Chief Medical Officer of Antares Pharma, commented, “We appreciated the opportunity to highlight analysis of our clinical trial data on XYOSTED at this year’s congress. We believe the multiple dosage strengths (50 mg, 75 mg, 100mg) of XYOSTED can allow patients to be titrated to their optimal dose. As always, we value our engagement with healthcare providers who are committed to patient care.” About SMSNA The Sexual Medicine Society of North America’s objective is to promote, encourage, and support the highest standards of practice, research, education, and ethics in the study of human sexual function and dysfunction.

About Antares Pharma Antares Pharma, Inc. is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused primarily on the development and commercialization of self-administered injectable pharmaceutical products using advanced drug delivery auto injector technology. The Company has a portfolio of proprietary and partnered commercial products with several product candidates in various stages of development, as well as significant strategic alliances with industry leading pharmaceutical companies including Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd. (Teva), AMAG Pharmaceuticals (AMAG), Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) and Idorsia Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Idorsia). Antares Pharma’s FDA-approved products include XYOSTED ® (testosterone enanthate) injection, OTREXUP ® (methotrexate) injection for subcutaneous use and Sumatriptan Injection USP, which is distributed by Teva. The Company also markets NOCDURNA ® (desmopressin acetate) in the U.S. and expects to commercially launch TLANDO ® (testosterone undecanoate) in the U.S. pending final FDA approval. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION WARNING: BLOOD PRESSURE INCREASES XYOSTED ® can cause blood pressure (BP) increases that can increase the risk for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke and cardiovascular death, with greater risk for MACE in patients with cardiovascular risk factors or established cardiovascular disease. Before initiating XYOSTED ® , consider the patient’s baseline cardiovascular risk and ensure blood pressure is adequately controlled. Starting approximately 6 weeks after initiating therapy, periodically monitor for and treat new onset hypertension or exacerbations of pre-existing hypertension in patients on XYOSTED ® . Re-evaluate whether the benefits of XYOSTED ® outweigh its risks in patients who develop cardiovascular risk factors or cardiovascular disease while on treatment. Due to this risk, use XYOSTED ® only for the treatment of men with hypogonadal conditions associated with structural or genetic etiologies. XYOSTED ® INDICATIONS AND USAGE XYOSTED ® (testosterone enanthate) injection is an androgen indicated for testosterone replacement therapy in adult males for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone. Limitations of Use: Safety and efficacy of XYOSTED ® in males less than 18 years old have not been established. XYOSTED ® CONTRAINDICATIONS Men with carcinoma of the breast or known or suspected carcinoma of the prostate. Women who are pregnant. Testosterone may cause fetal harm. Known hypersensitivity to XYOSTED ® or its ingredients. Men with hypogonadal conditions not associated with structural or genetic etiologies. XYOSTED ® WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Monitor hematocrit approximately every 3 months to detect increased red blood cell mass and polycythemia. Monitor patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) for worsening signs and symptoms of BPH. Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) have been reported in patients using testosterone products. Evaluate patients with signs or symptoms consistent with DVT or PE. Testosterone has been subject to abuse, typically at doses higher than recommended for the approved indication and in combination with other anabolic androgenic steroids. Exogenous administration of androgens may lead to azoospermia. Edema with or without congestive heart failure may be a complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. Sleep apnea may occur in those with risk factors. Monitor prostatic specific antigen (PSA) and lipid concentrations periodically. Depression and suicidal ideation and behavior, including completed suicide, have occurred during clinical trials in patients treated with XYOSTED ® . ADVERSE REACTIONS The most commonly reported adverse reactions (>5%) were: hematocrit increased, hypertension, PSA increased, injection site bruising, and headache.

He was 59. Tyler's manager said he died peacefully at home in Los Angeles Sunday morning. ""If you met him once you made a friend for life,"" his manager said. He is survived by his wife Jennifer Carno, whom he married in 2017. Tyler was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer in September 2018, he revealed this summer. He said doctors discovered it during a routine physical when he was 56. Tyler was best known for the role of Gunther, the Central Perk barista who had an unrequited crush on Jennifer Aniston's Rachel Greene. Warner Bros. Television mourns the loss of James Michael Tyler, a beloved actor and integral part of our FRIENDS family. Our thoughts are with his family, friends, colleagues and fans. ❤️☕️ pic.twitter.com/9coGnT5BHz — FRIENDS (@FriendsTV) October 24, 2021 But his career also included appearances on other sitcoms, such as ""Just Shoot Me!"" ""Sabrina, the Teenage Witch,"" and ""Scrubs,"" and he even played himself once on ""Episodes"" with Matt LeBlanc. Most recently, he released a spoken-word performance of the poem ""If You Knew,"" which was adapted into a short video to raise awareness for the Prostate Cancer Foundation. Donations to the Prostate Cancer Foundation in Tyler's name may be made here. Last month, Tyler made an appearance via Zoom on the ""Friends: The Reunion"" special. The special, which aired on HBO Max, saw the main cast -- Courteney Cox, David Schwimmer, Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, and Matthew Perry -- revisit some of the biggest on-screen moments and discuss their memories of the show. Asked whether the ""Friends"" cast already knew about his illness, Tyler said the show's producers had been aware ""for a long time"" and that Schwimmer had corresponded with him on Instagram. According to the Mayo Clinic, prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer and the second-biggest cause of cancer death for men in the United States. While some types of prostate cancer grow slowly and may need minimal or even no treatment, others are aggressive and can spread quickly. During an interview with the ""Today"" show this summer, Tyler fought back tears as he said earlier detection is key and that he regretted not listening to ""my wonderful wife."" Tyler urged viewers to ""ask your doctor for a PSA (prostate-specific antigen) test"" next time they go in for an examination or check-up, adding that ""caught early (it is) 99% treatable.""

Study finds 'robust' evidence that Covid-19 is seasonal infection,https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/health/study-finds-robust-evidence-that-covid-19-is-seasonal-infection-329928,,,,"London, October 26 Covid-19 may be a seasonal infection linked to low temperatures and humidity, much like seasonal influenza, according to new ""robust"" evidence found by researchers. The study, recently published in the journal Nature Computational Science, also supports the considerable contribution of airborne SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the need to shift to measures that promote ""air hygiene."" A research team led by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal), Spain, noted that a key question regarding SARS-CoV-2 is whether it is behaving, or will behave, as a seasonal virus like influenza, or whether it will be equally transmitted during any time of the year. A first theoretical modelling study suggested that climate was not a driver in Covid-19 transmission, given the high number of susceptible individuals with no immunity to the virus. However, some observations suggested that the initial propagation of Covid-19 in China occurred in a latitude between 30 and 50 degrees N, with low humidity levels and low temperatures between 5 degrees and 11 degrees Celsius. ""The question of whether Covid-19 is a genuine seasonal disease becomes increasingly central, with implications for determining effective intervention measures,"" said Xavier Rodo, director of the Climate and Health programme at ISGlobal and coordinator of the study. The researchers first analysed the association of temperature and humidity in the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 spread in 162 countries across five continents, before changes in human behaviour and public health policies were put into place. The results show a negative relationship between the transmission rate (R0) and both temperature and humidity at the global scale, the researchers said. Higher transmission rates were associated with lower temperatures and humidity, they said. The researchers then analysed how this association between climate and disease evolved over time, and whether it was consistent at different geographical scales. They used a statistical method that was specifically developed to identify similar patterns of variation at different windows of time. The team found a strong negative association for short time windows between the number of cases and temperature and humidity. The patterns were consistent during the first, second and third waves of the pandemic at different spatial scales: worldwide, countries, down to individual regions within highly affected countries and even to the city level. The first epidemic waves waned as temperature and humidity rose, and the second wave rose as temperatures and humidity fell, according to the researchers. However, this pattern was broken during summertime in all continents, they said. ""This could be explained by several factors, including mass gatherings of young people, tourism, and air conditioning, among others,"" said Alejandro Fontal, researcher at ISGlobal and first author of the study. When adapting the model to analyse transient correlations at all scales in countries in the Southern Hemisphere, where the virus arrived later, the same negative correlation was observed. The climate effects were most evident at temperatures between 12 degrees and 18 degrees Celsius and humidity levels between 4 and 12 grammes per cubic metre (g/m3). However, the study authors warned that these ranges are still indicative, given the short records available. Using an epidemiological model, the researcher showed that incorporating temperature into the transmission rate works better for predicting the rise and fall of the different waves, particularly the first and third ones in Europe. ""Altogether, our findings support the view of Covid-19 as a true seasonal low-temperature infection, similar to influenza and to the more benign circulating coronaviruses,"" Rodo said. This seasonality could contribute importantly to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, since low humidity conditions have been shown to reduce the size of aerosols, and thereby increase airborne transmission of seasonal viruses such as influenza. ""This link warrants an emphasis on 'air hygiene' through improved indoor ventilation as aerosols are capable to persist suspended for longer times,"" said Rodo. The study highlights the need to include meteorological parameters in the evaluation and planning of control measures.

(Nasdaq: DICE), a biopharmaceutical company leveraging its proprietary technology platform to build a pipeline of novel oral therapeutic candidates to treat chronic diseases in immunology and other therapeutic areas, today announced that the first healthy volunteer has been dosed in the Company’s Phase 1 clinical trial of S011806. S011806 is an orally-available, small molecule antagonist of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-17 (IL-17), which is a validated drug target for the treatment of a variety of immunological diseases. The Phase 1 trial of S011806 is designed to generate safety and pharmacokinetic data, as well as provide early clinical proof-of-concept in psoriasis patients. “S011806 is designed to be a highly selective and potent orally administered inhibitor of the IL-17 cytokine, a well-validated target in psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondylarthritis,” said Kevin Judice, Ph.D., founder and CEO of DICE Therapeutics. “The initiation of this clinical trial for S011806, the first of several programs in our IL-17 franchise, marks a major milestone in our mission to bring an effective and convenient oral therapy to patients suffering from IL-17 mediated diseases like psoriasis.” The Phase 1 clinical trial is a first-in-human, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that will evaluate S011806 in healthy volunteers and psoriasis patients in the UK. The trial will evaluate single and multiple ascending doses in healthy volunteers to understand the safety and pharmacokinetics of S011806. In addition, the Phase 1 clinical trial will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and efficacy of S011806 across two dose regimens in psoriasis patients, which could provide early clinical proof-of-concept and dose selection guidance for use in future studies. About S011806 and Psoriasis S011806 is an orally available, small molecule antagonist of the pro-inflammatory signaling molecule IL-17, an immune cell-derived cytokine that is produced in response to infection by certain microorganisms. Upon binding to its receptor on various cell types found in tissues (e.g. keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells), IL-17 elicits downstream signals that orchestrate sustained tissue inflammation, with the aim of clearing the invading pathogen. In autoimmune diseases, the immune system appears to over-react and mount strong immune responses in the absence of an obvious infectious event. Over the past two decades, research has shown that IL-17 is a powerful driver of psoriasis, a skin disease that occurs in the absence of an obvious infectious event. Psoriasis manifests as erythematous plaques with thick scaling that can occur anywhere on the body. Symptoms include itching, bleeding, and pain; furthermore, the disease can lead to disfiguration and considerable psychological burden. According to the National Psoriasis Association, more than eight million Americans – and 125 million people worldwide – suffered from psoriasis in 2020. There is no cure for psoriasis. S011806 is being developed initially for the treatment of psoriasis, with the objective of achieving therapeutic benefit similar to that of the U.S. FDA-approved injectable biologics. About DICE Therapeutics, Inc. DICE Therapeutics, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company leveraging its proprietary technology platform to build a pipeline of novel oral therapeutic candidates to treat chronic diseases in immunology and other therapeutic areas. DICE is initially focused on developing oral therapeutics against well-validated targets in immunology, with the goal of achieving comparable potency to their systemic biologic counterparts, which have demonstrated the greatest therapeutic benefit to date in these disease areas. The Company’s DELSCAPE platform is designed to discover selective oral small molecules with the potential to modulate protein-protein interactions (PPIs) as effectively as systemic biologics. DICE’s lead therapeutic candidate, S011806, is an oral antagonist of the pro-inflammatory signaling molecule, IL-17, which is a validated drug target implicated in a variety of immunology indications. DICE is also developing oral therapeutic candidates targeting α4ß7 integrin and αVß1/αVß6 integrin for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, respectively.

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared that by 2050, the number of people living with disabling hearing loss will reach over 900 million. Apart from that, physiological aging of the ear, genetic susceptibility, higher noise exposure, vascular disorder, and chronic inflammation would also contribute to the surging demand for these aids. However, the social stigma associated with hearing loss and devices often results in patients missing their check-ups. It may hamper growth. Hearing Devices Segment to Lead Stoked by Rising Usage of Behind-the-ear Devices Based on product, the hearing devices segment is set to hold the largest hearing aids market share and lead in the coming years. This growth is attributable to the rising usage of behind-the-ear devices as they resemble Bluetooth earphones. Also, invisible-in-the-canal and completely in the canal devices are nowadays experiencing high demand because of their ability to provide more confidence in people. Increasing Development of Novel Devices to Spur Growth in Europe In 2020, North America procured USD 2.48 billion in terms of revenue. The increasing adoption of less noticeable devices to surge the aesthetic appeal would aid growth. Europe is projected to witness lucrative growth throughout the forthcoming years on account of the rising research and development activities to create advanced hearing aids. In Asia Pacific, the increasing old age population is expected to drive growth. Have Any Query?

Moderna says its low-dose COVID vaccine works for kids 6 to 11,https://6abc.com/moderna-vaccine-for-kids-who-has-near-me-costco-booster-covid/11166164/,,['AP'],,"Moderna said half-dose shots induced strong levels of virus-fighting antibodies in youngsters, with temporary side effects such as fever and fatigue.",,2021-10-25 16:10:58,"Moderna said Monday that a low dose of its COVID-19 vaccine is safe and appears to work in 6- to 11-year-olds, as the manufacturer moves toward expanding shots to children. Competitor Pfizer's kid-sized vaccine doses are closer to widespread use, undergoing evaluation by the Food and Drug Administration for nearly the same age group - starting at age 5. Its vaccine already is authorized for anyone 12 or older. Moderna hasn't yet gotten the nod to offer its vaccine to teens but is studying lower doses in younger children while it waits. Researchers tested two shots for the 6- to 11-year-olds, given a month apart, that each contained half the dose given to adults. Preliminary results showed vaccinated kids developed virus-fighting antibodies similar to levels that young adults produce after full-strength shots, Moderna said in a press release. EMBED > More News Videos Vaccines for children will ""very likely"" be available in early November, Dr. Anthony Fauci told ""This Week"" anchor George Stephanopoulos. The study included 4,753 kids ages 6 to 11, who got either the vaccine or dummy shots. Moderna said that like adults, the vaccinated youngsters had temporary side effects including fatigue, headache, fever and injection site pain. The study was too small to spot any extremely rare side effects, such as heart inflammation that sometimes occurs after either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines, mostly among young men. Moderna said it plans to submit its pediatric data to the FDA and global regulators soon. The FDA hasn't yet ruled on the company's application to expand its vaccinations to 12- to 17-year-olds, although some countries have cleared Moderna's shots for adolescents. But the U.S. is expected to begin vaccinating kids under 12 sometime next month, if the FDA clears small doses of the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine for 5- to 11-year-olds. Pfizer reported last week that its kid-sized doses proved nearly 91% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 in the younger age group, even as the extra-contagious delta variant was spreading widely. FDA's advisers will deliberate Pfizer's evidence in a public meeting Tuesday. If the agency authorizes Pfizer's kid shots, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the following week is set to recommend who should receive them. Report a correction or typo",,6abc
Quitting at younger age cuts most smoking-associated cancer mortality risk,https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-10-younger-age-smoking-associated-cancer-mortality.html,['Health'],,,"(HealthDay)—Starting to smoke at any age is associated with an increased cancer mortality rate, while quitting, especially at younger ages, can avert most of this risk, according to a research letter published online Oct. 21 in JAMA Oncology.",,2021-10-25 15:54:14,"(HealthDay)—Starting to smoke at any age is associated with an increased cancer mortality rate, while quitting, especially at younger ages, can avert most of this risk, according to a research letter published online Oct. 21 in JAMA Oncology . Blake Thomson, D.Phil., from the American Cancer Society in Atlanta, and colleagues conducted a prospective cohort study to examine the correlation between age at smoking initiation and cessation and cancer mortality at ages 25 to 79 years. The researchers found 10,014 cancer deaths at ages 25 to 79 years among 410,231 participants with 3.7 million person-years of follow-up. The overall cancer mortality rate ratio associated with current smoking was 3.00 compared with never smokers. The rate ratios were 4.01, 3.57, 3.15, 2.86, and 2.44 for those starting at ages younger than 10, 10 to 14, 15 to 17, 18 to 20, and 21 years or older, respectively. If these excesses were interpreted as mainly causal, smoking would account for 75 and 59 percent of cancer deaths among those starting at younger than 10 years and at age 21 years or older, respectively. Compared with never smokers, the rate ratios were 0.95, 1.23, 1.45, and 1.88 for quitting at ages 15 to 34, 35 to 44, 45 to 54, and 55 to 64 years, respectively, resulting in avoiding an estimated 100, 89, 78, and 56 percent of the excess cancer mortality risk seen in association with continued smoking.

Staffer calls Mayo Clinic 'communist' for vaccine rule and resigns her job,https://www.inforum.com/newsmd/health-news/7253387-Staffer-calls-Mayo-Clinic-communist-for-vaccine-rule-and-resigns-her-job,,,,"Kalley Newkirk, a 25-year-old pregnant woman who has worked at Mayo Clinic for four years, opposes the requirement for employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Currently on administrative leave, she wrote a very critical letter of resignation, spurring a right wing talk show host to bring her on his online show.",,2021-10-25 18:33:17,"ROCHESTER -- Mayo Clinic administrative assistant Kalley Newkirk opposes the mandate for all non-exempt employees to receive COVID-19 vaccinations to the point that she resigned from her position and described the clinic’s policy as “communist” in an interview on an online conservative talk show. Newkirk, a 25-year-old pregnant woman who has worked at Mayo Clinic for four years, believes one shot of the Pfzier vaccine in January caused her to not be able to sleep or eat for days and led her to be hospitalized in a locked mood disorder ward in the Generose Building for 10 days. One month after her discharge from the hospital, she had a miscarriage, followed by a second miscarriage a month later. Her doctors and medical team said there was no medical connection between the vaccine and her disorders or miscarriages, and at least three medical studies seeking a correlation between the vaccines and miscarriages have not established any connection. Newkirk's care team strongly urged her to get the second Pfizer shot, but she fervently believes the vaccine was the source of her problems as she is very sensitive to medicine. Acknowledging that she has no medical education, Newkirk said her opinion was “based on how I had been in the period from when I left the hospital to when those events (miscarriages) happened… it just all correlated so much. I think you'd have to be there in person to further understand.” She also cites the “research” of Dr. Robert Malone, a virologist who speaks out against the COVID-19 vaccines. Her unsubstantiated belief that the vaccine caused her health problems caused her distress, especially when Mayo Clinic sent out a message earlier this month that non-exempt employees would be terminated in January if they were not vaccinated. “I was devastated. I sobbed pretty much the rest of the day,” Newkirk said of getting the email on Oct. 13 about the vaccine requirement. “I knew that I needed to think about what I was doing with my career choices and what the next steps of my life were going to be, because of the baby on the way.” She had an interview for a promotion at Mayo Clinic scheduled, but she canceled it because of the vaccination rule. A few days after she sent her resignation letter, Newkirk sent a longer letter to Mayo Clinic CEO Dr. Gianrico Farrugia and other Mayo Clinic leaders to tell them of her decision. “I am NOT an anti-vaxxer. I have every other vaccine under the sun! I believe in science, I believe in research, but what I don’t believe in: politics getting involved in personal health choices,” she wrote. “This institution is falling victim to communism. The Mayo brothers believed that politics was to STAY OUT of Mayo Clinic; we were always told to remain neutral. Now, we are folding to communist executive orders and not standing up with our own voice and research.” She cited the Mayo Clinic’s references to a federal vaccine mandate from the Biden administration as evidence that the clinic’s decision to have employees get the shot is political versus medical. In addition to supporting the “communist” political agenda, Newkirk also said that Mayo Clinic’s true reason to back this is financial. “They do get money from the government for Medicare and Medicaid. And that I'm sure that is the reason that they did this mandate, honestly. That's what I think… I do believe this whole thing is about money,” she said. In a statement Monday, Mayo said ""making COVID-19 vaccination a requirement to work at Mayo Clinic will help ensure we have a healthy workforce and that Mayo Clinic is a safe place to receive care — just as our patients expect. In consideration of the safety of our patients, staff, visitors and communities, Mayo Clinic is transitioning to the next phase of its COVID-19 vaccination program, with vaccination required to continue to work at Mayo Clinic. A review process will be available for staff to seek medical or religious exemptions to vaccination. Staff may participate in social media and advocacy on their own behalf, in accordance with applicable Mayo Clinic policies."" Newkirk posted her letter on her Facebook page and to a private online Mayo Clinic employee group of about 1,100 people who oppose the vaccine rule. The group enthusiastically supported her statements. Some of them passed her letter on to online talk show host Stew Peters. Peters, who calls himself ""The Bullhorn of the People,"" asked Newkirk to be on his program. Peters, who claims that the FDA has not approved any COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S., introduced the interview by commenting on statements Mayo Clinic doctors have made on social media criticizing people who oppose vaccinations. He said Mayo Clinic has ""annihilated their credibility in their response to this pandemic."" “Not everyone at Mayo Clinic is bad, "" he said introducing Newkirk as a brave woman opposing the clinic's mandate. Newkirk, wearing her Mayo Clinic employee badge, told Peters her story. The interview was posted on Oct. 22. The next day, Newkirk said she was placed on administrative leave by Mayo Clinic. On Monday, Mayo said she was still employed there. After writing the letter, appearing in the Peters’ show, what does Newkirk hope Mayo Clinic will do? She believes Mayo Clinic has the power to stand up to the federal government and defy any vaccine orders, if the leadership would “speak up” and support its employees who don’t want to be vaccinated.",https://www.postbulletin.com/incoming/7252636-e4utgj-newkirkonpetersshow.jpg/alternates/BASE_LANDSCAPE/newkirkonpetersshow.jpg,inforum

The company also provided a clinical data update from the on-going Phase 1/2 clinical trial of 4D-110 in patients with choroideremia. “Today we announced the first ever clinical data reported with an intravenous product invented from our Therapeutic Vector Evolution platform at 4DMT. These interim data demonstrate clinical proof-of-concept for tolerability and clinical activity,” said David Kirn, M.D., Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of 4DMT. “These data support our belief that 4D-310 is well-tolerated, and has the potential to deliver patient benefit after a single intravenous injection. Importantly, the post-treatment AGA enzyme activity in patients’ blood was within, or significantly above, the normal range despite the presence of pre-existing anti-AGA antibodies, which are a result of prior ERT in these patients. To our knowledge, these initial clinical data are the first demonstration of durable serum AGA activity within the normal and above normal range following gene therapy in a difficult to treat classic Fabry disease patient population.” “We designed 4D-310 for a unique dual mechanism of action, enabling the potential treatment of target tissues such as heart, blood vessel walls and kidney through cross-correction from high and stable serum AGA activity, as well as through direct transduction and AGA expression in target cells,” said Dr. Raphael Schiffmann, M.D., Senior Vice President & Clinical Therapeutic Area Head, Lysosomal Storage Diseases and Cardiology. “This dual MOA opens the potential to effectively treat the broadest possible range of Fabry patient populations. Given the encouraging initial clinical activity and tolerability profile of 4D-310, we plan to continue enrolling a broad patient population, including both anti-AGA antibody positive and negative patients, as well as classic and late-onset patients.” “Fabry disease is a severe lysosomal storage disease with high unmet medical need despite ERT with an invasive biweekly infusion regimen,” said Dr. Jerry Vockley, M.D., PhD, Chief of Genetic and Genomic Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and a principal investigator on the 4D-310 Phase 1/2 trial. “These interim clinical data suggest that 4D-310 is well-tolerated and has the potential to effectively treat a broad range of patients with Fabry disease.” 4D-310 for Fabry Disease Interim Clinical Data Summary The data described are from the ongoing Phase 1/2 dose-escalation and dose-expansion clinical trial assessing intravenous 4D-310, 4DMT’s targeted and evolved C102 vector-based product candidate designed for a broad Fabry disease patient population. The primary endpoint of the trial is safety and tolerability. Key secondary endpoints include change from baseline in serum AGA activity and serum lyso-Gb3. The data cutoff date was October 12, 2021. As of the data cut-off date, three patients with Fabry disease were enrolled, with post-treatment follow-up ranging from six weeks to six months. These patients were enrolled in the 1E13 vg/kg cohort, the lower of two planned dose escalation cohorts: 1E13 vg/kg and 3E13 vg/kg. Prior to dose-escalation, the trial is designed to allow enrollment of an additional 6 patients in the 1E13 vg/kg dose cohort. An oral corticosteroid prophylaxis taper was administered over 10 weeks post-dosing. Key Baseline Characteristics All three patients currently enrolled are patients with classic Fabry disease, defined as having AGA activity <5% of mean normal in peripheral blood white cells and having one or more clinical characteristics such as acroparesthesia, hypohidrosis, angiokeratoma or cornea verticillata. Consistent with the classic Fabry disease phenotype, all three patients had serum AGA activity below mean normal at baseline, ranging from 0 – 0.42 nmol/hr/mL (population normal range: 4.44 – 27.42 nmol/hr/mL; population mean normal 9.9 nmol/hr/mL). All three patients had prior experience on enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Patients 1 & 3 were enrolled while receiving ERT (ON-ERT). Patient 2 had prior experience with ERT but was not receiving ERT (OFF-ERT) for ~13 months prior to dosing. Consistent with prior ERT use, each patient had positive baseline anti-AGA antibody titers: Patient 1: Baseline anti-AGA antibody titer 1:947 Patient 2: Baseline anti-AGA antibody titer 1:99,900 Patient 3: Baseline anti-AGA antibody titer 1:13,900 4D-310 Preliminary Clinical Activity Summary Following 4D-310 infusion, mean serum AGA enzyme activity was within, or significantly above, the normal range in all three patients, despite pre-treatment anti-AGA antibody titer positivity in all patients. Lyso-Gb3 substrate concentrations in serum decreased significantly in Patient 2, who enrolled in the trial OFF-ERT and therefore with an elevated lyso-Gb3 level. Lyso-Gb3 substrate concentrations in serum remained low and stable in Patients 1 and 3 following discontinuation of ERT. Patients 1 & 3: Baseline: Both patients were receiving ERT and at baseline had low-lyso-Gb3 and positive pre-treatment anti-AGA antibody titers (1:947 – 13,900, respectively). AGA Enzyme Activity: Both patients demonstrated an increase in serum AGA enzyme activity significantly above the normal range at all timepoints through last follow-up. Mean post-treatment serum AGA enzyme activity in patients 1 & 3 were well above the normal range at 2,506% (25-fold) and 2,114% (21-fold) mean normal (248.1 and 209.3 nmol/hr/mL, respectively). Lyso-Gb3: Patient 1 serum lyso-Gb3 remained low and stable through week 26 and after ERT discontinuation at week 14. Patient 3 serum lyso-Gb3 remained low and stable through week 6 and following ERT discontinuation at week 2. Patient 2: Baseline: Patient 2 entered the trial OFF-ERT but had prior ERT treatment that was stopped ~13 months prior to dosing. As a result, Patient 2 had a high baseline lyso-Gb3 level (101 ng/mL). Patient 2 also had the highest pre-treatment anti-AGA antibody titer of all three patients treated and of all patients screened (1:99,900). AGA Enzyme Activity: Patient 2 demonstrated a significant increase in serum AGA enzyme activity into the normal range. Mean serum AGA enzyme activity increased to 58% of mean normal (5.7 nmol/hr/mL). Lyso-Gb3: Lyso-Gb3 decreased significantly (>50%) within the first four weeks and remained stable through week 12. 4D-310 Interim Safety Data Summary 4D-310 demonstrated a manageable safety profile in all three patients. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. No serious adverse events were reported with Patient 1 and 3, and these patients did not have either atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) or liver toxicity, which are the 2 primary class-related toxicities associated with systemically administered AAV. Patient 2 developed transient, self-limited aHUS within approximately one week following treatment and was admitted to the hospital for observation and hydration and was discharged after four days. As a result of hospitalization, this event was classified as a serious adverse event (SAE). The patient received no complement inhibitors; kidney function recovered without further intervention Laboratory parameters improved daily throughout this observation period, and no lasting clinical sequelae resulted. Transient and asymptomatic grade 1 (mild) transaminitis (AST/ALT) was also observed in this patient at a separate and single protocol-defined timepoint. No other SAEs were reported. 4D-110 for Choroideremia Clinical Data Update Summary 4D-110 is currently being studied in an ongoing Phase 1/2 dose escalation clinical trial in patients with choroideremia. To date, six patients with clinically advanced choroideremia have been enrolled. A standard 3+3 dose escalation design was used. Patients were enrolled in one of two dose cohorts: 3E11 vg/eye (cohort 1; n=3) and 1E12 vg/eye (cohort 2; n=3). To date, at the 3E11 vg/eye dose (Cohort 1), 4D-110 was well-tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities or serious adverse events. Initial signals of clinical activity were observed at this dose, through anatomical measurements of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) by fundus autofluorescence area and photoreceptors by ellipsoid zone area. We expect to continue enrolling at the 3E11 vg/eye dose level. At the 1E12 vg/eye dose, pigment dispersion (iris transillumination) was observed in three patients in the 1E12 vg/eye cohort ~7 to 9 months following treatment. Two cases were asymptomatic and one patient reported mild glare. In each case the investigator described this as an SAE but no hospitalization or medical intervention was initiated. We believe this pigment dispersion finding is consistent with REP1 transgene overexpression in iris pigment epithelial cells (IPE); no association with inflammation was evident.

About 4DMT 4DMT is a clinical-stage company harnessing the power of directed evolution for targeted gene therapies. 4DMT seeks to unlock the full potential of gene therapy using its platform, Therapeutic Vector Evolution, which combines the power of directed evolution with approximately one billion synthetic capsid sequences to invent evolved vectors for use in targeted gene therapy products. The company is initially focused in three therapeutic areas: ophthalmology, cardiology, and pulmonology. The 4DMT targeted and evolved vectors are invented with the goal of being delivered through clinically routine, well-tolerated and minimally invasive routes of administration, transducing diseased cells in target tissues efficiently, having reduced immunogenicity and, where relevant, having resistance to pre-existing antibodies. 4DMT is currently advancing five product candidates in clinical development: 4D-310 for Fabry disease, 4D-125 for XLRP, 4D-150 for wet AMD, 4D-710 for cystic fibrosis and 4D-110 for choroideremia. 4D Molecular Therapeutics™, 4DMT™, Therapeutic Vector Evolution™, and the 4DMT logo are trademarks of 4DMT. 4D-310, 4D-125 and 4D-110 are our product candidates in clinical trials and have not yet been approved for marketing by the US FDA or any other regulatory authority.

Quips about putting radio on the internet aside, the persistent popularity of podcasting and the cockamamie climb of Clubhouse shows that audio-based platforms will continue to echo around the upper echelons of the ecosystem for a while yet. Joining the fray is Heart to Heart, an audio-first dating app aiming to bring back some intimacy to the process of finding the right person for your next foray, whether that’s a saucy encounter or a mate for life. “I used to act, and from my time in acting, I saw how much voice, and audio experiences drive intimacy between people,” explains Joshua Ogundu, co-founder and CEO of Heart to Heart. “When it came down to the dating apps, it was never something I could get into. I felt like you needed to come up with a textual one-liner. That was never my way of approaching romantic conversations.” Heart to Heart is pushing back against the endless swiping and messaging of many of its competitors, offering a contrasting experience to sending the same opening line to dozens of people or typing with your thumbs until deep into the night. “I believe that the best consumer investments come from people who have unique insights on consumer behavior and ways that new tech products can allow new forms of social interaction,” said Charles Hudson from Precursor Ventures, who led the pre-seed investment round. “I have been a big fan of Josh’s TikTok videos for some time and his ability to poke at the tech industry with timely, relevant videos really showcased his creativity and ability to communicate via short-form video. I think the idea around confirming photos, storytelling, and audio will yield a product that really speaks to people’s unmet needs around communication and will create a whole new way for people to connect.” While Precursor doesn’t particularly focus on audio-first startups, the team has seen a number of opportunities in that space. It was an early investor in Howard Akumiah’s company, Betty Labs (acquired by Spotify), as well as Isa Watson’s company (Squad), Falon Fatemi’s company (Fireside) and several others that are still in stealth. “I believe that there is a major wave of interesting activity happening around non-music audio and I believe that we are still in the early innings of non-music, audio-driven social experiences,” says Hudson. “The last two companies that I feel really innovated in this category were Tinder and Bumble. I think Josh and his team have a new mechanic that feels differentiated and unique and I think it has the potential to be the foundation for a new way for people to meet and get to know each other in ways that aren’t easily accomplished today.” Joshua Ogundu, co-founder and CEO of Heart to Heart (Photo provided by Heart to Heart) The company raised the pre-seed round of $750,000. The round was led by Precursor Ventures, and Bryce Roberts of OATV & Angelica Nwandu of The Shade Room partnered on the investment, as well as Marie Rocha at Realist Ventures. In addition, a number of angel investors joined the round, including Chris Bennett (Wonderschool), Andy Weissman (USV) and Gregory Levey (Robinson Huntly). “The main thing we are trying to accomplish with the $750K, is to focus on building our iOS app, and making LA our first launch market,” says Ogundu. “Dating is such a local experience, and it makes sense to us to build and improve locally, then scaling it up from there.” “Voice is so intentional and intimate, and that is exactly what we’re building here at Heart to Heart,” says Ogundu, suggesting that the voice mechanic is helpful in a dating context because it helps slow people down. “I think that because it takes more energy to send that voice snippet to someone, you’ll be more intentional with who you even look to strike up conversations with.” The founding team consists of Joshua Ogundu, who wears the CEO hat. He is joined by Arihant Jain and Komal Shrivastava, who have been heading up the engineering and design efforts. The company hopes to get its product to market by the end of the year.",2021-10-25 18:30:46,,,techcrunch

Opinion: A lot of B.C. workers seem ready to get fired over COVID-19 vaccinations,https://www.nsnews.com/coronavirus-covid-19-local-news/opinion-a-lot-of-bc-workers-seem-ready-to-get-fired-over-covid-19-vaccinations-4548316,,['Keith Baldrey'],,It is puzzling why so many people with scientific training have refused the vaccine.,,2021-10-25 17:27:00,"There are more than 400,000 unvaccinated eligible people in B.C. and most of them are slowly discovering the consequences of their inaction when it comes to not being immunized from COVID-19. They cannot go to restaurants for a meal, travel by plane or train, or attend many sporting and cultural events. Many of them, however, are going to discover they face an even more serious consequence for refusing the vaccine: the loss of their jobs. Vaccination mandates are expanding in scope and number, and they will cover thousands of people. This week, more than 5,000 health-care workers were expected to be placed on unpaid leave because they have yet to receive a single dose of a COVID-19 vaccine by the Oct. 26 deadline. Already more than 1,700 long-term care staff – including almost 400 nurses – have been placed on leave because of their non-vaccinated status. It is puzzling why so many people with scientific training have refused the vaccine. In long-term care, the refusal rate is the same for both nurses and food service employees. To estimate how many other employees in other sectors with looming vaccination mandates may soon be out of a job, it is useful to look at the numbers in both the health-care sector and the long-term care sector. The vaccination rates among employees in both sectors is around 96% (although only 93% in the Interior). On the one hand, that is an impressively high figure but on the other, it also translates into literally thousands and thousands of unvaccinated staff potentially losing employment. For example, there are roughly 130,000 employees in B.C.’s health-care sector. This includes all medical staff, support staff and administration. So while an unvaccinated rate of just 4% seems small, when it is applied to such a large pool of people, it can produce a big number. Hence, the 5,000-plus health-care workers placed on unpaid leave. If that 4% unvaccinated rate turns out to be the average in other sectors, that works out to roughly 1,200 B.C. government employees losing their jobs on Nov. 22, when their mandate takes effect and about 240 Vancouver civic workers suffering the same fate on Dec. 6. Of course, these numbers will be much smaller if enough people covered by these mandates come to their senses and get a vaccine that has been proven safe and effective for billions of people around the world. In addition, it is reasonable to think that many unvaccinated people, when faced with the harsh reality that accompanies the loss of a paying job and financial benefits, will do just that. Perhaps the federal government’s announcement that these folks will not qualify for unemployment insurance will cause some to reconsider. We can only hope so. In the meantime, it will be interesting to see how many school districts impose their own vaccine mandates on teachers and other school workers. If the 4% average for unvaccinated staff that we’ve seen in health care is mirrored in the K-12 sector, hundreds of teachers could be added to the “on leave” crowd. The consequences for refusing the vaccine are getting harsher.

"More than 9 out of 10 workers comply with vaccine mandates, but some remain defiant",https://abc30.com/vaccine-mandate-covid-mandates-vaccines-biden/11162552/,,['AP'],,These defiant workers have the potential to create disruptions in a tight labor market.,,2021-10-24 15:07:05,"BATH, Maine -- Josh ""Chevy"" Chevalier is a third-generation shipbuilder who hasn't missed a day of work during the pandemic in his job as a welder constructing Navy warships on the Maine coast. But he's ready to walk away from his job because of an impending mandate from President Joe Biden that federal contractors and all U.S. businesses with 100 or more workers be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. ""People are fighting for their constitutional rights - the way they think their life should be,"" said Chevalier, one of hundreds of employees at Bath Iron Works threatening to leave. Chevalier is among a small but significant number of American workers deciding whether to quit their jobs and careers in defiance of what they consider intrusive edicts that affect their freedoms. The Biden administration, public health officials and many business leaders agree that , prudent actions necessary to help the world emerge from a pandemic that has killed more than 700,000 Americans and nearly 5 million people worldwide. The defiant workers make up a small fraction of the overall workforce, with many cities, states and businesses reporting that more than 9 out of 10 of their workers are complying with mandates. But they have the potential to create disruptions in a tight labor market and have become the latest roadblock in overcoming the vaccine hesitancy that allowed the COVID-19 crisis to take a devastating turn over the summer. In many cases, the reasons for the objections are rooted in misinformation. The refusers come from all types of occupations - defense industry workers, police officers, firefighters, educators and health care workers. In Seattle, a group of city firefighters turned in their boots at City Hall on Tuesday to protest a vaccination requirement. Thousands of people have sought religious or medical exemptions that were rejected; others won't stand to be told what to do and have quit or been fired. , the football coach at Washington State University, was let go from his $3.2 million-a-year job on Monday, along with four assistants. Rolovich, the first major college coach to lose his job over vaccination status, claimed a religious exemption but has declined to elaborate. He is suing. The conflict over mandates is likely to grow in the coming weeks. The Biden administration is expected to move forward any day with the mandate that employers with 100 or more workers require all employees be vaccinated or undergo weekly testing, though enforcement likely won't start for several weeks. The rule for federal contractors goes into effect in December, with no testing option, but many businesses, governments and schools are already implementing mandates. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other groups that represent large employers have warned workers might simply migrate to jobs at smaller businesses where they don't face vaccination requirements. That could create challenges for large retailers going into the holiday season, among other disruptions, the chamber warned. Individuals who've left their jobs and are seeking work that doesn't require vaccinations are sharing information on social media. Small employers looking for workers are turning to online job boards such as RedBalloon, where employers sign a pledge that they won't make vaccines a condition for hiring. Andrew Crapuchettes, RedBalloon's founder and chief executive, said he started the online job board more than two months ago for people ""who just want to work and don't want to get into politics in the office."" More than 800 companies have posted, and more than 250,000 people have visited the site, he said. Some states, , Montana and Florida, are gearing up to fight or undercut the Biden mandates. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued an executive order Monday barring any entity from requiring vaccines. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Thursday he will call a special session to pass legislation to combat vaccine mandates, saying that, ""in Florida, your right to earn a living is not contingent upon whatever choices you're making in terms of these injections."" Melissa Alfieri-Collins, a 44-year-old mother of two, said she resigned from her job as a nurse at Jersey Shore Medical Center in Neptune, New Jersey, rather than undergo regular COVID-19 testing. She said the hospital recognized her request for a medical exemption, but she objected to the requirement that only unvaccinated people get tested, arguing that even vaccinated people can spread disease. ""My family and I, we had a long talk, and I basically don't want to compromise my values any more,"" said Alfieri-Collins, who hopes to become a nurse practitioner and pursue her own holistic practice. ""I am very sad because I am the type of nurse that loves my patients and my patients love me,"" she said. Anthony Polenski, director of strategic partnerships for tech recruiting company Jobfuture.ai, said he's seeing candidates who want to know, ""Will this company force me to take a jab?"" Polenski said they are often leaving previous employers because of a vaccine mandate. ""They don't want their vaccination status attached to their employment,"" he said. At the shipyard in Maine, frustration is rising among union members. On Friday, some 100 shipbuilders gathered outside the shipyard during their lunch break to protest being forced to get vaccinated. They marched down the street, holding signs decrying the mandate and using choice four-letter words that made clear what they think of the president and his vaccine mandates. The union fears it could lose more than 1,000 workers, or 30% of its membership, over the federal contractor mandate. Dean Grazioso, a 33-year Bath Iron Works employee, said he's not anti-vaccine but that he knows vaccinated coworkers, friends and family members who've contracted breakthrough COVID-19 infections. Such infections are rare and vaccinated people who get COVID-19 usually have mild symptoms and are far less likely to be hospitalized or die. The 53-year-old is still deciding whether to get the shot. ""I'm still up in the air,"" he said. ""But I've got a huge decision to make."" ____",,abc30

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Ed Sheeran (@teddysphotos) Already Releases Songs The uptempo first single, “Bad Habits,” rode the top spot on the English singles charts for eleven weeks and peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 tally. It was accompanied by a high-gloss video in which Sheeran stars as a glam vampire. The dance pop tune “Shivers” entered at No. 1 on the UK charts, displacing “Habits” and topped-out at No. 10 on the Hot 100. He spends another late night looking for love in the special effects-heavy “Shivers” video, which finds Ed dressing up in an homage to pal Elton John’s feathery outfits and hanging out in a morgue with his beloved. YouTube Shorts Preview If you simply cannot wait to hear the album, Sheeran provided Sheerios with a first-of-its-kind preview of the album via a collab with YouTube on a series of 14 video shorts — one for each song on the album — which dropped on Monday morning (Oct. 25). The clips, which each run 20 seconds or less, cover a wide range of scenes, from Sheeran pounding the drums to the high-energy opening track “Tides,” to him stepping into a bathtub filled with ice while wearing a suit in the “Shivers” bit and smiling at a man dancing in a doorway with a giant bowl of chips for “Bad Habits.” Elsewhere, Sheeran and his wife Cherry lounge around, kiss and flirt in the affecting preview of the gentle acoustic ballad “First Times,” Ed busts out a spray can for some freestyle painting to the strains of the wistful acoustic pop gem “Overpass Graffiti” and he spotlights his cat’s adventures in the adorable “The Joker and the Queen” short for the hushed piano ballad. We also hear a bit of the yearning mid-tempo “Leave Your Life,” the remix-ready dance pop tracks “Collide,” “2Step” and “Stop the Rain,” as well as the sweeping acoustic jangle of “Love in Slow Motion,” the tear-stained acoustic homage to those we’ve lost, “Visiting Hours,” the bouncy lullaby “Sandman” and the bubbling, beat-driven album closer “Be Right Now.” {""nid"":""9650211"",""type"":""post"",""title"":""Ed Sheeran Tests Positive for COVID-19 Days Ahead of His New Album Release"",""relative_path"":""\/articles\/news\/9650211\/ed-sheeran-tests-positive-covid-19\/"",""media"":{""width"":1548,""height"":1024,""extension"":""jpg"",""mime_type"":""image\/jpeg"",""type"":""image"",""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/09\/ed-sheeran-2021-vma-billboard-1548-1631733909-compressed.jpg"",""sizes"":[{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/09\/ed-sheeran-2021-vma-billboard-1548-1631733909-compressed.jpg"",""width"":1548,""height"":1024},{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/09\/ed-sheeran-2021-vma-billboard-1548-1631733909-compressed.jpg"",""width"":1548,""height"":1024}],""orientation"":""landscape"",""id"":""9630573"",""caption"":null,""credit"":null}} Tour Dates Though he hasn’t yet unveiled his North American tour plans, Sheeran has dropped the dates for his upcoming 2022 UK/European stadium tour, which will include shows in Belfast, Manchester, London, Amsterdam, Paris, Copenhagen and Belfast.

It locked down thousands of people in the North.Top U.S. health officials signaled confidence that children ages 5 to 11 will begin getting Covid-19 vaccines by early November. The Pfizer vaccines will likely be given at pediatricians’ offices rather than at pharmacies or large sites.Singapore health officials deployed their fake-news law against the “Truth Warriors” website for making claims regarding vaccine effectiveness and ivermectin’s use as a treatment, among other things.Key Developments:Virus Tracker: Cases top 243.6 million; deaths surpass 4.9 millionVaccine Tracker: More than 6.86 billion shots givenResurgent Covid means it could be another tough winterDelta variant is bolstering the case for booster shots: QuickTakeSingapore Issues Fake-News Directive Against Website (10:03 a.m. HK)Singapore’s Ministry of Health has instructed the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (Pofma) Office to issue a Correction Direction to the “Truth Warriors” website for assertions related to the effectiveness of Covid vaccines, use of ivermectin as a treatment and more.Read more: Singapore Deploys its Fake News Law Against Anti-Vaxxer GroupJokowi Pushes for Southeast Asia Travel Arrangement (9:58 a.m. HK)Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo pushed for travel to reopen in Southeast Asia, saying this would help economic recovery in the region that has seen coronavirus cases recede.He said the Association of Southeast Asian Nations needs to hit its vaccination target of 70% of the population of over 650 million people as soon as possible so that economies could reopen safely.Jokowi, as the president’s known, has been pushing for a regional travel corridor arrangement since late last year.

The small county bordering Mongolia is the current outbreak’s hotspot, home to nearly one-third of the more than 150 infections found over the past week in the mainland.The lockdown came a day after a warning from National Health Commission officials that the outbreak would continue to worsen after spreading to 11 provinces in about a week. China reported 38 Covid infections on Monday, half of which were found in Inner Mongolia.Read more: China Locks Down Thousands in North as Delta Outbreak SpreadsSouth Korea to Start Return to ‘Normal Life’ (9:42 a.m. HK)South Korea will begin a “gradual return to normal life” in Nov. as 70% of the population has been fully vaccinated, President Moon Jae-in said at the National Assembly.

The encounter, earlier reported by Florida Politics, took place between Senator Tina Polsky and Joseph Ladapo, who met her in her office regarding his upcoming confirmation after being appointed by Governor Ron DeSantis. She has been diagnosed with breast cancer. “He’s very smug,” Polsky said. “And I told him several times, ‘I have this very serious medical condition.’ And he said, ‘That’s OK,’ like it basically has nothing to do with what we are talking about.’”Ladapo has questioned the vaccine’s efficacy and safety, and like DeSantis, opposes shot mandates. Florida was hit hard by the latest wave of the virus, accounting at one point for a fifth of U.S. cases. Pediatricians Should Vaccinate Kids, Gottlieb Says (1:09 p.m. NY)Children ages 5 to 11 should be vaccinated in their pediatrician’s offices, said Scott Gottlieb, former head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. He’s a board member of Pfizer Inc., whose vaccine is to be considered for authorization for young children. “Getting children vaccinated is a much more consultative endeavor,” Gottlieb said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “You don’t want children to have to go to mass vaccination sites or even necessarily a pharmacy. You want them to go into the comfort of their own pediatrician’s office.”He said the vaccine, developed with BioNTec SE, will be packaged for doctors’ offices.U.S. Kids Set for Shots by Early November (11:30 a.m. NY)Two top U.S. health officials signaled confidence that children ages 5 to 11 will begin getting Covid-19 vaccines by early November. “If all goes well, and we get the regulatory approval ... it’s entirely possible if not very likely that vaccines will be available for children from five to 11 within the first week or two of November,” Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, said on ABC’s “This Week.”His comments were echoed by Rochelle Walensky, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which must ultimately approve the shots. “There will be vaccine out there so children can start rolling up their sleeves,” Walensky said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”Health experts say vaccinating children will be a key step in helping end the U.S. outbreak, though a Kaiser Family Foundation study found in September that only about a third of parents would vaccinate their children immediately. Almost 65 million eligible Americans ages 12 and older are not vaccinated. Advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will meet Tuesday to consider data for children’s use of the vaccine by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE. Approval by the FDA and the CDC is also required.Sunak Plays Down New U.K. Curbs (6:18 a.m. NY)U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak told the BBC that available Covid-19 data don’t support a move to harsher restrictions. Speaking against a backdrop of rising virus cases and ahead of his budget this week, Sunak said a return to the furlough program that saw the government pay as much as 80% of the wages of idled workers was not on the cards. “We don’t envisage having to impose significant economic restrictions in the way that we had to over the last year.”Malaysia Sees Further Drop in Cases (4:49 p.m. HK)Malaysia recorded the fewest cases since the end of June. The Southeast Asian country added 5,666 new infections Sunday, bringing the total number of cases to more than 2.43 million, according to a tweet by Health Malaysia Director-General Noor Hisham Abdullah. Meanwhile, almost 95% of Malaysia’s adult population have received a complete dose of vaccines, according to the health ministry’s data.Russia Deaths, Cases Remain Near Record (4:17 p.m. HK)Russian coronavirus cases and deaths remained near record levels on Sunday ahead of the implementation of strict nationwide curbs to stem a surge in infections.There were 35,660 new cases and 1,072 deaths over the past day, slightly below records set Saturday, according to data from the national coronavirus headquarters. Last week, President Vladimir Putin ordered nationwide non-working days for the first week of November to slow the spread, while Moscow will be closed for most business from Oct. 28 through Nov. 7.China Expects Outbreak to Widen (4:08 p.m. HK)China’s new Covid-19 infections will increase in coming days and the areas affected by the pandemic may continue to expand.The current outbreak in China is caused by the delta variant, Wu Liangyou, an official at the National Health Commission, said at a briefing in Beijing on Sunday. The outbreak has expanded to 11 provinces in the week since Oct. 17, Mi Feng, a spokesman for the commission, said at the same briefing.Earlier on Sunday, Beijing authorities announced the city is halting cross-province tourism and closing card and majhong rooms. China’s capital will also cut the number of large events and increase supervision over small clinics and pharmacies, according to the official WeChat account of the Beijing Municipal Health Commission.Belgium to Weigh Stricter Rules (3:21 p.m. HK)Belgian Prime Minister Alexander de Croo will meet with his cabinet Monday to discuss the virus situation and consider tighter curbs. The government is mulling a return to stricter mask rules, Belga reports, citing a government spokesman. Belgium, like other European countries, is seeing rising infections, with more than 8.5 million of a population of about 11.5 million being fully vaccinated. ©2021 Bloomberg L.P.With assistance from Bloomberg.

Just like last year, Halloween will look a little different as public health officials encourage people to implement measures to help curb the pandemic at a time when Saskatchewan is still experiencing high levels of COVID-19. Creative ways to maintain physical distancing while handing out candy include using tongs to pass it out or sliding it down a pipe. Sticking with your own household or small groups of close friends this Halloween is also recommended. Both trick-or-treaters and those handing out treats should wear a mask. It’s important to note that Halloween masks aren’t a substitute for medical ones. Other safety tips include cleaning and disinfecting common touch areas like handrails, doorbells and doorknobs frequently while handing out candy. Kids should carry sanitizer with them. Only individually wrapped candy should be accepted and you may want to consider a quarantine or disinfection of the wrappers before consuming the candy. The Government of Saskatchewan said proof of vaccination and masking orders remain in effect for any Halloween celebrations at public venues. The City of Prince Albert said with Halloween falling on a Sunday this year, there is an expectation that more kids will be out and about collecting treats. Similar to last year, the city created two posters that residents can print off to indicate if they will be participating in festivities. “People’s decision to participate should be respected. The Halloween posters are a simple way to let people know if you’re participating in Halloween this year,“ said Jim Toye, city manager. “The posters were tremendously popular last year, so we are making them available again this year.” The posters are can be downloaded here. Parkland Ambulance is also offering some safety tips this Halloween including waiting until children are home to sort and check treats. In a media release, Parkland Ambulance wrote ‘though tampering is rare, a responsible adult should closely examine all treats and throw away any spoiled, unwrapped or suspicious items.’ More safety tips can be found below.

Similar to last year, the city created two posters that residents can print off to indicate if they will be participating in festivities. “People’s decision to participate should be respected. The Halloween posters are a simple way to let people know if you’re participating in Halloween this year,“ said Jim Toye, city manager. “The posters were tremendously popular last year, so we are making them available again this year.” The posters are can be downloaded here . Parkland Ambulance is also offering some safety tips this Halloween including waiting until children are home to sort and check treats. In a media release, Parkland Ambulance wrote ‘though tampering is rare, a responsible adult should closely examine all treats and throw away any spoiled, unwrapped or suspicious items.’ More safety tips can be found below. — panews@pattisonmedia.com On Twitter: @princealbertNOW",https://s3.amazonaws.com/socast-superdesk/media/20211019201032/f3f234ed-41f6-4a6e-829d-cc99626b47c2.png,panow

Philip Murphy's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, taxation and COVID executive orders on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight.""",,2021-10-26 02:46:18,"close Video NJ gov candidate Jack Ciattarelli responds to Murphy's comments about lockdown orders Republican challenger tells 'Tucker Carlson Tonight' the Democrat is 'way to extreme' for the blue Garden State. New Jersey Republican gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli joined "" Tucker Carlson Tonight "" on Monday to respond to Gov. Philip Murphy's taxation policies and previous comments about whether the consideration that his socioeconomic lockdown orders violated the Constitution might be ""above my pay grade."" Host Tucker Carlson reminded the audience of Murphy's last appearance on the program in April 2020 -- when New Jersey and its surrounding Democrat-run states instituted sweeping mandates against religious or family gatherings and operations of businesses like gyms and restaurants . In April 2020, Carlson asked Murphy about a case in which 15 men were arrested for congregating at a Lakewood, N.J., synagogue for the funeral of Orthodox Rabbi Chaim Moshe Strulovics in violation of his executive order banning large gatherings. 'The Bill of Rights, as you well know, protects Americans' rights — enshrines their right to practice their religion as they see fit and to congregate together to assemble peacefully,"" Carlson said. ""By what authority did you nullify the Bill of Rights in issuing this order? How do you have the power to do that?"" ""That's above my pay grade, Tucker,"" Murphy responded. ""I wasn't thinking of the Bill of Rights when we did this ... we looked at all the data and the science and it says people have to stay away from each other. That is the best thing we can do to break the back of the curve of this virus, that leads to lower hospitalization and ultimately fatalities.""

Phil Murphy, who salutes him on stage, during an early vote rally at Weequahic Park, Saturday, Oct. 23, 2021, in Newark, N.J. (AP Photo/Stefan Jeremiah) In response, Ciattarelli said that while Democrats hold about a 1 million voter advantage in the Garden State, many New Jersey Democrats are ""fiscally conservative and socially moderate."" ""This guy is just way too extreme,"" he said, noting that no Democratic governor has been reelected in the state since Gov. Brendan Byrne in the late 1970s. Carlson went on to compare Murphy to former Gov. Jim Florio, a Democrat of the early 1990s whose plan to hike taxes in the billions upset so many New Jersey voters that they responded by giving Republicans their first legislative majority in Trenton in decades. ""Phil Murphy has done the same thing [as Jim Florio], he's gone way too far left,"" replied Ciattarelli, formerly a state lawmaker and county freeholder from Somerset. ""A year and a half ago on this very show, [Murphy claimed] ‘the Bill of Rights is above my pay grade’. -- It’s not funny. But worse than that, he told the highest taxed people in the nation ‘ if taxes are issue, we are probably not your state ’."" Incumbent Gov.

Seattle's Pike Place Market struggles to find footing since COVID-19,https://www.startribune.com/seattles-pike-place-market-struggles-to-find-footing-since-covid-19/600109609/,,"['Paul Roberts', ' Seattle Times']",,,,2021-10-24 19:00:00,"Like many vendors at Pike Place Market in Seattle, Scott Chang isn't sure when business will resume its pre-COVID normal. True, this summer brought welcome crowds of tourists and locals to the open-air Seattle landmark. Sales at See Lee Gardens, the flower business owned by Chang's family, are nearly back where they were before the pandemic shuttered the market's picturesque warren of stalls and shops. But there's another, more somber reason for See Lee's rebound: Several competing flower vendors haven't come back to the market, or are only there a few days a week. They now sell at other outlets that don't require the long commute into downtown Seattle. Even Chang, for the first time, is selling some of his flowers elsewhere, partly as a hedge against future COVID-related disruptions. ""We're never going to quit Pike Place,"" says Chang, 36, of the place that has hosted his family business since the 1980s. But the pandemic ""was a big eye-opener that we have to look for other venues."" Fifty years after Pike Place Market was nearly razed in the name of progress, the sprawling institution faces another, even more complex nemesis. Although many of the market's more than 500 businesses saw solid sales this summer, visitor numbers are still below their 2019 levels. Many vendors and farmers are still on reduced hours, and dozens haven't returned or are squarely on the fence about coming back. Though most of the market's 222 restaurants, shops and other brick-and-mortar tenants are back, just 69 of 96 farmers and 147 of 186 crafters had returned as of Oct. 6, market officials said. All told, the market's business community is still down by around 15% from 2019. ""It truly is up in the air right now,"" says Jim Johnson, owner of Olympia-based Johnson Berry Farm, a 22-year market stalwart that hasn't been back since last fall. Even many of those vendors who have made it back did so by shifting how — and sometimes where — they do business as they prepare for their second pandemic winter. Collectively, it points to changes for an iconic, eclectic retail community that was facing challenges before COVID, including labor shortages and competition from online retailers and from a proliferation of farmers markets in virtually every town and neighborhood. Although Pike Place Market remains the region's go-to source for a fully immersive ""meet the producer"" experience, ""we can't live on it alone,"" says Mary Bacarella, executive director of the Pike Place Market Preservation and Development Authority (PDA), which owns and manages the 9-acre, 14-building complex. The market, Bacarella, ""has to adapt."" Revenue for the PDA, which charges some tenants a percentage of retail sales, fell from a record $22.6 million in 2019 to $13.2 million in 2020, leading to cost-cutting and layoffs of 15% of its staff. The PDA offered tenants $3.7 million in rental assistance. The market's fundraising arm, the Pike Place Market Foundation, offered nearly $700,000 in small-business grants. Paycheck Protection Program loans helped. Individual businesses, meanwhile, came up with their own adaptations. At the Sound View Cafe, Alex Amon, whose family purchased the place almost 30 years ago, completely re-engineered the menu, replacing many complicated higher-end items with simpler selections that ""were more cost-efficient for us."" Like retailers everywhere, many market vendors also found ways to rely less on face-to-face sales. But some vendors also found ways to reduce their reliance on the market itself. ""To help pick up the slack"" in sales, Holmquist Hazelnut Orchards stepped up sales at 16 other regional farmers markets, many of which were thriving even as Pike Place struggled, said co-owner Richard Holmquist. For some of the market's older vendors, the pandemic was simply a good moment to retire. Vickie Clark Rafael, a 66-year-old jeweler in Shoreline, has operated a day stall for more than 40 years. Though she hasn't returned since the pandemic struck, she had planned to stay on until 70, but is now unsure. ""This whole COVID reality has made things so challenging to decide what to do,"" she says.",,startribune

LINGARD SET FOR TRANSFER INTEREST As many as 12 Premier League clubs could join the January transfer hunt for Manchester United midfielder Jesse Lingard, one journalist has claimed. The 28-year-old was once a key player for the Red Devils, but his influence has waned. Indeed, he became frozen out under manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and sought a move away. While Lingard impressed on loan at West Ham last season, though, he has gone back to a similar level of game time as before. In fact, he has only played 55 minutes in the Premier League across four games this term. Overall, meanwhile, he has played 146 minutes in seven Man Utd outings. As such, speculation has emerged again that Lingard could leave again, this time for good, especially since his contract expires next summer. According to Sky Sports News journalist Michael Bridge, Newcastle – with their new super-rich owners – will be one of several Premier League clubs thinking about signing him in the coming months. “I think Lingard will definitely be the talk of January,” the reporter told Give Me Sport. “I’d imagine Newcastle will go for him. I’d say about 12 Premier League clubs will probably register an interest.” Previous reports have claimed that Everton lead West Ham in the race for the England international, who continues to impress Three Lions boss Gareth Southgate despite his lack of club minutes. But Lingard is not the only United player tipped for an exit in January.

Getty Images The Green Bay Packers placed wide receiver Davante Adams on the reserve/COVID-19 list Monday. Being placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list is for a player who either tests positive for COVID-19 or who has been in close contact with an infected person or persons. Adams ranks second in the NFL with 52 catches and is third in yards (744). Green Bay (6-1) travels to Arizona (7-0) Thursday for an NFC showdown, and playing without Adams would be an enormous blow to the Packers. Green Bay learned earlier on Monday that defensive coordinator Joe Barry had also tested positive for COVID-19 and will likely miss Thursday’s game in Arizona. “You have to take it in stride and just approach it with positive mind and a positive attitude and just make the best of whatever situation you encounter,” Packers coach Matt LaFleur said. After a rocky start to his career, Adams — a second round draft pick in 2014 — has developed into one of the top receivers in football. Adams was named to the Pro Bowl each season from 2017-20 and he was named first-team All-Pro in 2020. Adams was the NFL’s No. 1 rated wide receiver by Pro Football Focus last season. Adams set a franchise record with 115 receptions and posted 1,374 receiving yards (11.9 avg.) a year ago despite missing two games. He also matched Sterling Sharpe’s single-season team record for receiving touchdowns (18) set in 1994.

He led the NFL in receiving TDs, receiving yards per game (98.1) and receptions per game (8.2), becoming the first NFL player to lead the league in all three categories since Sharpe did so in 1992. Adams earned first-team All-Pro honors from The Associated Press, the first Packers wide receiver to receive first-team recognition since Antonio Freeman in 1998. He also earned first-team All-NFL honors from the Pro Football Writers Association. “There’s a reason he’s got that ‘99’ rating in Madden,” LaFleur said recently. “He is a baller.

Gansu province lies along the ancient Silk Road and is famed for the Dunhuang grottoes filled with Buddhist images and other religious sites. The National Health Commission said 35 new cases of local transmission had been detected over the past 24 hours, four of them in Gansu. Another 19 cases were found in the Inner Mongolia region, with others spread across several provinces and cities. Residents in parts of Inner Mongolia have been ordered to stay indoors. Despite having largely stamped out cases of local infection, China maintains a zero-tolerance policy toward the pandemic, characterized by lockdowns, quarantines and compulsory testing for the virus. The spread of the delta variant by travelers and tour groups is of particular concern ahead of the Winter Olympics in Beijing in February. Overseas spectators already are banned, and participants will have to stay in a bubble separating them from people outside. Authorities in the capital said on Sunday people arriving from places with recent infections would need to show a negative virus test result and give regular health reports.

KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 25 — As Japan gears up for its general election on Oct 31, a city in Gunma Prefecture is racing against time to sharpen pencils for voters to use.This is part of the Covid-19 pandemic measure to prevent the spread of the virus, Sora News 24 reported.The city, Ota, anticipates a voter turnout of over 100,000 voters where they will vote using voter slips and pencils.To minimise the spread of the virus, voters in the city will take the pencils home after they fill up their ballot papers.This means one voter needs to be allotted one pencil.To complicate matters, early voting has been brought forward, meaning that the specially treated, bacteria-resistant pencils, that do not come pre-sharpened, needed to be ordered in a hurry to meet the deadline. City employees are now tasked to sharpen the pencils during their breaks in between work. One Twitter user criticised the city for getting civil servants to sharpen the pencils.“Why not order disposable pencils ? Each of these costs between six and seven yen (22 sen to 26 sen). You’re currently wasting labor costs.” なぜ使い捨て鉛筆のペグシルを発注しないのか？1本当たり6〜7円ですし、これでは人件費の無駄使いですよ。【衆院選 市職員が鉛筆1万本削る】 pic.twitter.com/Dfpo7JiLbz— TOMOKIN 友金良太 (@TOMOKIN_Voice) October 19, 2021 Another social media user said after shaving a few pencils, his fingers felt numb.“So spare a thought for the hardworking pencil sharpeners in Ota, and cross your own fingers that they manage to supply enough pencils for all the voters that need them.”",2021-10-25 04:57:42,,,malaymail

Ngayon nakita natin we were able to defeat Delta (Now, we have seen that we were able to defeat Delta),"" Galvez had said.Vergeire believes Galvez made the statement in the context of earlier projections that the country may mirror the experiences of India and Indonesia, where a surge of Delta cases affected their overall response.""We were expecting talaga na magkakaroon ng sobrang taas na kaso, tayo ay ma-o-overwhelm, marami ang mamamatay, pero hindi po natin naabot 'yung projected number of cases at 'yung overwhelmed [na] health system (We were expecting high cases, that we may get overwhelmed and many will die, but we never reached the projected number),"" she said.She added that while the country' health system was challenged because of the Delta surge, prompt actions by the government led to a reduction of cases one and a half months after the variant was first detected.""Hindi po natin sinasabi na 'natalo' na natin ang Delta, ang Delta po, nandito pa sa atin... pero ang pinakamaganda, we were able to control and reduce the number of cases and naisaayos natin ang (We never said that we 'defeated' Delta, as Delta remained here in the country, but what is good is that we were able to control and reduce the number of cases and we have fixed our) health system capacity,"" Vergeire said.The Philippines has a low-risk classification of Covid-19 with a two-week growth rate of -48 percent and an average daily attack rate of nearly 5.9 cases per 100,000 population.The National Capital Region is under moderate risk with a -53-percent decrease in the two-week growth rate and ADAR of 8.56 cases per 100,000 population.On Monday, the country reported 4,405 new Covid-19 cases for a total of 2.761 million cases.",,2021-10-25 17:00:36,,https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2021/10/26/22598.jpg,manilatimes

She says it was important to humanize Big Meech and Southwest T","BMF is the Starz network’s latest crime drama. Executive produced by Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson, the show, centers on the Flenory brothers’ rise and fall. Demetrius “Big Meech” Flenory (Demetrius “Lil Meech” Flenory Jr.) and Terry “Southwest T” Flenory (Da’Vinchi) began their career as small-time drug dealers in Detroit before rising to become two of the biggest drug traffickers in the country. Though the brothers were eventually imprisoned for their crimes, BMF director Tasha Smith says it’s important to humanize them and their story. Tasha Smith | Rodin Eckenroth/WireImage RELATED: What Does 50 Cent’s New Starz Show ‘BMF’ Stand For? ‘BMF’ is based on a true story The Flenory brothers came of age in the 1980s in Detroit. They began their career when they were just teens selling bags of cocaine for $50. However, when the crack cocaine epidemic exploded, their business skyrocketed. Creator and showrunner Randy Huggins was born and raised in Detroit amid the same era, so he wanted the story to remain as accurate as possible. “I took some liberties, but everything there is based on a story,” Huggins told Urban Hollywood 411. “Obviously, you can’t have people’s names in there. Obviously, some of the places may have changed.” He added, “I don’t think there’s a character in there, that I hadn’t heard of,” he said. “I may have to take a creative liberty to make an art pop a little bit more. I may have to take a creative license to make a scene funnier than it may have been, but that’s just part of telling a story. This is not a documentary.” ⁦@bmfstarz⁩ watch now on Starz! pic.twitter.com/77CuDRTaQM— Tasha (@tashasmith4real) September 26, 2021 RELATED: ‘BMF’: Who Is Eminem’s Character White Boy Rick? ‘BMF’ director Tasha Smith wanted to humanize Big Meech and Southwest T In 2005 both Southwest T and Big Meech were sentenced to prison for money laundering and drug trafficking. Southwest T was released in early 2021 amid COVID-19 (coronavirus) concerns while Big Meech will remain in jail until 2028. No one is questioning the illegality of their enterprise. However, director/actor Tasha Smith wanted to humanize the men instead of vilifying them. “I just wanted to give a little justice to the story of Big Meech and Terry Flenory and people like them by putting some humanity on it,” Smith told TV Line. “When you think about crime and crime lords, the fictional Corleones and the real Gottis are embraced. A lot of times, when it comes to the Black community, there is a stigma where other communities are glorified. But BMF shows some empathy and understanding on the way these brothers were brought up in a two-parent home.” RELATED: 50 Cent Says the Success of ‘Power’ Made Starz Official Demetrius ‘Lil Meech’ Flenory Jr. wanted to make his father proud When it comes to portraying his father, Lil Meech did not take the task lightly. The actor spoke with his father every day while filming and he anxiously awaited his response to the pilot. “No one’s credibility amounts to his,” he told The Source. “I just want him to tell me he’s proud- he’s seen it, and he’s happy I did it and I killed it.

Bayern Munich club members move to end Qatar Airways sponsorship at general assembly,https://www.bavarianfootballworks.com/2021/10/25/22745330/bayern-munich-club-members-qatar-airways-sponsorship-annual-general-assembly-world-cup-2022,,['John Dillon'],,,"Bayern Munich board member Andreas Jung with Hamad International Airport CEO Akbar al-Baker after the club signed a new sponsorship deal, August 14, 2017. | Photo credit should read STRINGER/AFP/Getty Images Bayern’s hotly debated sponsorship by Qatar Airways will be discussed at the club’s upcoming Annual General Assembly in November. A motion initiated by Bayern Munich club member Michael Ott has gained traction and attention ahead of the club’s upcoming annual general assembly on November 25: Ott has filed a motion that would oblige Bayern to allow its sponsorship deal with Qatar Airways (2016/17-2022/23) to expire and forbid the club to conclude further sponsoring deals with companies of which a majority is owned by the Qatari Emirate. The motion, which can be found online at http://katar-antrag.de/, reads in translation as follows: May the members’ assembly resolve: FC Bayern Munich e.V. [registered club], through exercise of all necessary legal and factional avenues at its disposal, influences FC Bayern Munich AG [corporation] to the effect that sponsoring contracts with Qatar Airways or other companies majority-owned by the Emirate of Qatar are allowed to expire and not extended or not concluded de novo. [Editor: FC Bayern e.V. is the overarching club, which is majority owner of FC Bayern AG, the corporation that comprises the original soccer branch of the club. The annual general assembly includes the entire FC Bayern, from the chess team to the soccer team.] Ott sets out the justification for the measure in five detailed points. He told Bild, “We want to take preventative measures to prevent a new contract.” The principal reason is Qatar’s history of human rights violations. Ott explains, “Qatar Airways is 100% owned by the Emirate of Qatar. This country stands for massive human rights violations, and there moreover are serious charges of corruption in sports. Instead of effecting change, FC Bayern is actively helping the Emirate of Qatar with its sponsorship to draw attention away from these evils.” With such “indifference,” Ott argues, FC Bayern damages its own reputation and “falls short of its status as an exemplary model.” The motion would not, however, preclude Bayern from traveling to its annual training camp at the Aspire Academy in Doha, Qatar. Ott said that the event provides “an opportunity for critical communication, at least in theory.” I have commented several times on Bayern Munich’s relationship with Qatar Airways over the years. Bayern first visited Qatar in 2011, not long after Qatar made its controversial, and ultimately successful, bid to host World Cup 2022. Qatar’s Hamad International Airport became a “platinum sponsor” of the club in 2016, leading to the notorious Qatar Airways sleeve sponsorship in 2017. Recently, controversy over Qatar has been overshadowed by other themes, notably the Bayern leadership’s indignant response to insults leveled by its ultras at TSG Hoffenheim owner Dietmar Hopp, ensuing—arguably belated—engagement with the Black Lives Matter movement, and above all the Coronavirus pandemic. Even as the club still finds itself navigating difficult waters with respect to COVID-19 and vaccination, the subject of Qatar has not gone away. As World Cup 2022 looms on the horizon, despite the logistical nightmare a winter World Cup will create and ongoing allegations of corruption in the award process, the theme is bound to remain relevant.

Read More",2021-10-25 11:44:06,"BUCHAREST/MOSCOW — Russia reported a record high number of daily COVID-19 cases and some central European countries imposed fresh restrictions on Monday, as a new wave of the pandemic gathered pace. In Asia, the Red Cross called for urgent help for Papua New Guinea and China’s latest outbreak forced the capital Beijing to delay its annual marathon and step up other curbs, less than four months before it hosts the Winter Olympics. Authorities around the world have been sounding the alarm as infections surge, with governments in regions where vaccine uptake has been low forced to toughen up restrictions in a bid to stop the virus raging out of control. Russia on Monday reported 37,930 new COVID-19 infections in the last 24 hours, its highest single-day case tally since the start of the pandemic. Frustrated by the slow take-up of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine by its own population, authorities are introducing stricter measures this week to try to curb the spread of the pandemic. President Vladimir Putin last week declared that Oct. 30 to Nov. 7 would be paid non-working days. Vaccine skepticism is high across central and eastern Europe and as a result the region has become a hotspot. Tougher restrictions came into force in Romania and the Czech Republic on Monday, while in Slovakia stricter rules were expanded to more regions. In Bulgaria, police will start imposing fines on people who break restrictions from Monday. In Romania, where a government official on Saturday lamented a “disaster situation,” the government reintroduced a night curfew and made health passes mandatory for entry to most public venues, while school children were sent on vacation for two weeks. “The restrictions seem to be working, there are fewer people on the streets,” said Gheorghe Ion, a Bucharest cab driver. “I’ve been waiting here for an hour without an order.” Poland’s health minister warned that the government would need to consider tighter restrictions if cases kept increasing, but stressed that it was not planning a lockdown. While experts have said that a lack of confidence in public institutions caused by decades of Communist rule has fueled vaccine skepticism in the region, there were signs that more people were responding to fears about the wave by getting a jab. In Romania authorities said inoculations were on the rise last week, while in the Czech Republic the daily number of doses administered was the highest since late-August. URGENT EFFORTS The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies warned of the potential for huge numbers of deaths in Papua New Guinea unless international action was taken to help the island nation’s struggling health service. Less than 1% of the population has been fully vaccinated, according to Our World in Data figures, with the Red Cross blaming misinformation, public apprehension, and logistical challenges. “Urgent efforts and further support are needed in healthcare to prevent a massive loss of life in the coming days and weeks,” Uvenama Rova, PNG Red Cross secretary general, said. Chinese health officials warned on Sunday that its latest cluster, caused by the highly transmissible Delta variant and involving many carriers who recently traveled across some provinces, was increasingly likely to expand further. Beijing has banned entry of people from other cities with cases, and closed indoor venues such as some chess and card parlors, even in districts without infections. Although the infection numbers are far smaller than many places outside China, authorities have adopted a zero tolerance strategy. New Zealand saw its second-highest daily tally of COVID-19 cases since the pandemic began, with 109 new locally acquired coronavirus cases reported on Monday, the bulk of them in its largest city, Auckland. Once lauded for its success in stamping out the virus, New Zealand has been struggling with an outbreak of the Delta variant centered in Auckland, despite the city remaining under a strict lockdown for more than two months. In Western Europe cases were also on the rise, despite higher rates of vaccine uptake than in the continent’s east. Infections in the Netherlands have been rising for a month and reached their highest level since July on Sunday, after many social distancing measures were dropped in late September. Prime Minister Mark Rutte is expected to update coronavirus policies by Nov. 5, but pressure is rising to come up with an earlier response to the recent numbers.

On Monday, the province announced 90 per cent of all eligible adults have received their first vaccine dose, while 85 per cent have received their second. Among all eligible British Columbians (aged 12 and up), 89.6 per cent have received one dose and 84.4 per cent have received both doses. Fraser Health continues to record the most new cases, with 699 in the past three days. It also has the most active cases, with 2,030 of the 4,966 province-wide. Interior Health recorded the most deaths over the weekend with six in that region. Four people died in each of Fraser Health and Northern Health. There were three deaths in each of Vancouver Coastal Health and Island Health.

Capacity limits lifted for many B.C. venues On Monday, COVID-19 restrictions were further relaxed in most of B.C., with restaurants, movie theatres, performance venues, and arenas once again allowed to operate at full capacity. The easing of restrictions means guests are now allowed to mingle and do not need to stay in their seats. Venues are also now able to determine their own table limits and liquor service hours are returning to normal. There are some health rules still in place: everyone must be double vaccinated and everyone must be masked indoors. In addition, there is still no dancing allowed, which wedding planners have called disappointing and concert venues have said is confusing.

Events and certain non-essential settings in Abbotsford, Harrison Hot Springs, Boston Bar, Mission, Hope, Chilliwack, and Agassiz are only open to those who are double vaccinated, and even then, attendance is limited.

Taxing the super rich,https://www.manilatimes.net/2021/10/25/business/top-business/taxing-the-super-rich/1819612,['Business'],['Jenny Say-Ng'],,"Will the newly filed House Bill 10253 or the proposed Super Rich Tax Act follow the various tax reforms introduced by the Duterte administration and become law? The bill aims to levy an annual tax starting January 1, 2022 on citizens (residents and nonresidents alike) and resident aliens at the rate of 1 percent on wealth above P1 billion, 2 percent on wealth above P2 billion, and 3 percent on wealth above P3 billion.Around P236.7 billion is expected to be raised annually from the 50 richest Filipinos alone, to be used to help the government pursue anti-poverty measures and other social programs aimed at closing the widening divide between the rich and the poor, according to the bill's explanatory note. Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III's initial comment was that the wealth tax would drive capital out of the Philippines. How justified is this?The wealth tax is not new. In 2018, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) published a tax policy study focusing on wealth taxes. It showed that 12 OECD countries that used to have wealth taxes repealed these in the 1990s and 2000s and that the number of OECD countries that continued to impose wealth taxes had dwindled to just four by 2017. Based on the OECD study, many factors have been put forward to justify the repeal of net wealth taxes, one of which is the risk of capital flight, specifically due to increased capital mobility and access to tax havens. Hence, Dominguez's concern on the proposed super rich tax may be valid.Another factor that contributed to the repeal of wealth taxes — one that may apply to the Philippines — is the high cost of tax administration compared to limited revenues. In the Super Rich Tax bill, the net value of all taxable assets is defined as the market value of assets owned by a taxpayer, real or personal, tangible or intangible, wherever situated, reduced by debts owed by the taxpayer. While the definition may be simple, assessing the market value of all assets will be a very difficult exercise.While the market value of real properties, traded stocks, and other similarly traded assets may be easily obtained, hard-to-value assets such as intangibles, artwork, and the like may be harder to assess. In effect, it will take a chunk of the resources on the part of the tax office and the individual to ascertain the correct valuation — and this needs to be done on an annual basis. It is a considerable challenge in terms of tax administration and enforcing compliance.Further, taking into consideration the computation of net taxable assets wherein debts are allowable deductions, the OECD study mentioned that the wealth tax provides incentives for borrowing to lower the tax base and thus can encourage tax avoidance and, in effect, lower the revenue that should have been collected from the wealth tax.Let us look at some of the merits of imposing a wealth tax following the OECD study:First, the wealth tax aims to address wealth inequality and will help promote equality of opportunity following the foremost point in the OECD study. Although the Philippines levies taxes on passive and active income, considering that the ultra-rich already have a high value of accumulated wealth to begin with, the after-tax earnings (also substantial as these are proportionate to the capital/investment) they receive will only be added to their total wealth, thereby increasing their wealth over time.This is pointed out in the proposed bill. Based on the 2021 Forbes list of the Philippines' 50 richest, these folks grew their wealth by 30 percent to P4 trillion despite the Covid-19 pandemic. This is against a backdrop of 29 percent of Filipinos, or over six million families, living on a monthly income of P10,000 or less for two decades, with salaries and worker wages nationwide slightly increasing only to adjust for inflation. This gaping divide has resulted in 50 Filipinos owning more wealth than the poorest 71 million Filipinos combined.The second argument supporting the wealth tax, according to the OECD study, is that wealth provides benefits above and beyond income. Wealth may bestow social status, power, greater opportunities, satisfaction or provide an insurance value against unexpected future needs and it has been argued that such benefits should be taxed (Meade, 1978). This holds true in the Philippines where it is the wealthy that usually wield the power and have access to better opportunities.With government debt sitting at P11.64 trillion as of August 2021 and the Covid-19 pandemic still an ongoing battle, legislators are looking for ways to generate more taxes. This is seen in the various tax measures being proposed, including the Super Rich Tax bill. In deliberating the proposed measure, Congress will no doubt look at the pros and cons of levying a wealth tax. Let us hope our legislators are able to establish additional provisions as necessary for this proposal to be an effective tax-generating measure.The author is a senior manager with the Tax and Corporate Services Division of Navarro Amper & Co., a member of the Deloitte Asia Pacific Network.

He termed the project an important document on the history of Arunachal Pradesh at a meeting with the members of the core committee and sub-committee for the recognition of the State's unsung heroes, here on Saturday. The State government had in September formed a five-member core committee headed by Mein to conduct research on the contribution of various personalities of the state in the country's freedom struggle. The committee has been tasked with collecting and examining authentic documents, archives, journals, available in the libraries and other places, seeking comments of eminent personalities and others in this regard, visiting places of relevant historical interests and taking steps as deemed fit to give recognition to the unsung freedom fighters of Arunachal. The research work and documentation, after being compiled and completed, would be forwarded to the State government. Chief Minister Pema Khandu who has been spearheading the initiative had told the Assembly in September that the State government would build a memorial for all the ""unsung"" freedom fighters from the State, besides requesting the Centre to also honour them. Mein on the occasion also informed the members of the house that the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR), a captive body of the Union Ministry of Education, is planning to conduct a workshop-cum-seminar in the State early next year as part of Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav. He asked Rajiv Gandhi University Vice-Chancellor Saket Kushwaha and member secretary of the core committee, Dani Salu, to coordinate with the member-secretary of ICHR. Meanwhile, the house present decided to propose the ICHR to set up a centre in Arunachal Pradesh. Such a centre in the State would facilitate the research scholars and students carrying out research works and studies on the rich history and culture of Arunachal Pradesh, the members of the panel said. The committee also decided to participate in the live online series on social media on unsung heroes which would be conducted by ICHR. Prof Kushwaha during the meeting, presented a timeline to be followed by the sub-committee which shall work under the aegis of the RGU. According to the timeline, the sub-committee will submit the final report by the end of June 2022. In the meeting, Nepha Wangsa, author of The Nyinu Massacre, showed the collection of original documents from the national archive of the British Library in New Delhi. These documents will be handed over to the core committee through a formal ceremony at a later date. The house decided to store it in the State archive of the research department and also to put it on a website after the finalization of the research and documentation works. The meeting was also attended by education minister Taba Tedir, advisor to Chief Minister Tai Tagak, advisor to Deputy Chief Minister Anupam Tangu and RGU registrar N T Rikam, an official communiqué informed on Sunday.

NYC workers vaccine mandate protest shuts down Brooklyn Bridge traffic into Manhattan,https://www.foxnews.com/us/nyc-workers-protest-vaccine-mandate-in-brooklyn-bridge-march,,['Pilar Arias'],,New York City municipal employees are marching across the Brooklyn Bridge Monday against the COVID-19 vaccine mandate.,,2021-10-25 17:43:16,"close Video Vivek Ramaswamy: Vaccine mandate protests are the result of rampant lies on COVID-19 by public officials The ‘Outnumbered’ panel reacts to protests over vaccine mandates in New York City and CDC Director Walensky’s comments about education for the unvaccinated New York City municipal employees are marching across the Brooklyn Bridge Monday against the COVID-19 vaccine mandate. The protest, which is set to end in front of City Hall on the Manhattan side of the bridge, is billed as an anti-mandate protest on behalf of nearly 50,000 NYC employees who have yet to be vaccinated with a deadline just days away. Traffic is shut down on the Brooklyn Bridge into Manhattan as of 11:49 a.m., according to police. NYC'S BARCLAY'S CENTER SWARMED BY PROTESTERS SUPPORTING NETS' KYRIE IRVING'S REFUSAL TO BE VACCINATED PIX11 reports all city workers must have their first shot of the coronavirus vaccine by 5 p.m. Friday if they want to come to work the morning of Nov. 1. Monday's protest follows a protest Sunday night at the Barclay's Center in support of Kyrie Irving. A crowd of people rallied as the Brooklyn Nets lost to the Charlotte Hornets at their home opener without their point guard. At one point the protest turned violent when some demonstrators tried to break into the arena, clashing with security and police. Irving has refused to get vaccinated. As a result, he's not getting paid. The same could soon be said for thousands of city workers if they don't get the shot by Friday. That's the threat from Mayor Bill de Blasio with vaccination rates lagging behind the general population at several large city agencies including the NYPD and the FDNYP. NEW YORK CITY POLICE UNION THREATENS LEGAL ACTION OVER DE BLASIO VACCINE MANDATE ""It's time now. If you don't want to get vaccinated, you'll be put on unpaid leave. Well, the vast majority of human beings go to work to get paid. And also, I think for a lot of our first responders, there's a calling. They believe in the work, they care about the work. Those two factors I think are going to cause the vast majority to get vaccinated,"" Mayor de Blasio said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The mayor did offer a $500 incentive for city workers to get vaccinated and even that's causing controversy, with several unions now demanding back pay for workers who already got vaccinated without a bonus.

Residents in swaths of the province will be allowed to attend events like hockey games, concerts and weddings without any limits on numbers, but capacity will be capped at 50 per cent in areas where vaccination rates are low, including parts of the Fraser, Northern and Interior health regions. Attendees at all organized events in B.C. will be required to wear face coverings and show proof of COVID-19 vaccination. The move was eagerly anticipated by businesses, including those that require bookings well in advance for events like weddings. Harpal Sooch, owner of the Grand Taj Banquet Hall in Surrey, said he's cautiously optimistic about an uptick in business even as most large banquets were cancelled and won't be going ahead until next summer. ""This is my bread and butter for me and my family. Same thing for my partner, and same thing with all the banquet halls that are mostly run by families. We were closed for 15 months,"" he said of the toll on his finances. Sooch said the hall has been booked for two upcoming gatherings for Diwali — one next Saturday and another two weeks later — and he's hoping the business will start thriving again as more people return to socializing as usual. But Sooch said not everyone is ready for pre-pandemic-type parties while they still need to wear masks, especially seniors waiting for booster shots and families with children under 12 who can't yet be vaccinated. ""They're not getting into it. But hopefully everything goes on so by next summer we'll be fine,"" he said. ""That's what we're hoping for."" Heidi Tworek, a professor who specializes in health communications at the University of British Columbia's School of Public Policy and Global Affairs, said employers, businesses expecting more customers and even individuals inviting someone over for dinner should expect a range of reactions because the lack of regular contact with people after nearly two years will have impacted some people's mental health. ""There's sometimes a baseline assumption that every single person is eager to go back immediately to full capacity,"" she said, adding that while most people will have to get used to gathering with others outside their usual circle of contacts, those with an anxiety disorder will have a more difficult time being around those they don't know. People with specific health concerns in particular may ask about ventilation improvements at buildings, including their workplace, in order to feel safe so it will be crucial to provide that information while being patient and flexible, Tworek said. ""There are a lot of people who are immunocompromised or have other reasons to be concerned, who feel like there isn't transparency,"" she said, noting parents of schoolchildren in the Vancouver area spearheaded their own efforts to document and share COVID-19 exposures so families could decide to keep their child home to protect older or ill individuals. Government announcements about reopenings should include messaging for people who are reluctant to resume activities while the pandemic is ongoing, Tworek said. The day after capacity limits lift, British Columbia will require all health-care workers in the province to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, after an Oct. 12 deadline for employees in long-term care and assisted living facilities. Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry has said she expanded her order to all health-care settings partly to prevent unvaccinated staff working with seniors from jumping to jobs elsewhere.

He told the city’s ABC News affiliate that the “draconian” mandate would harm all New Yorkers. “We already don’t have enough cops, we don’t have enough corrections officers, we don’t have enough health care workers, we don’t have enough teachers...,” he said. “Stop this nonsense and the mandate.” Like this story?

That from an email received from the Algoma District School Board (ADSB). The ADSB has been working closely with Algoma Public Health (APH) to support several contact tracing investigations after positive COVID-19 tests were linked to individuals connected to River View Public School. APH declared a facility-wide COVID-19 outbreak at River View Thursday. The ADSB says there are six confirmed cases of COVID-19 among individuals associated with River View Public School. “Given the current number of cases, the high absenteeism rate (opting for virtual) and the number of classes already pivoted to hybrid, effective Monday, October 25th, all classes at River View P.S. will move to virtual for at least ten days. Please note that this decision is precautionary and intended to support the best scenario of staffing and supervision, while reducing the potential for additional asymptomatic spread. ADSB will be communicating with families closer to the proposed return date, to confirm when their child’s class is able to revert back to in-person learning,” the ADSB wrote. “This is not a school closure,” the board emphasized. “The move to remote/virtual learning is a precautionary measure made by the school board, not one that was ordered by the Health Unit.” “We regret any inconvenience this may cause, however, we do feel this precautionary decision is in the best interest of student and staff safety,” the ADSB wrote.",https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/sootoday/images/stock-images/20200526-adsb-summer-stock-dt-03.jpg;w=630,sootoday
Vancouver Canucks eager for return to home arena packed with fans,https://panow.com/2021/10/25/vancouver-canucks-eager-for-return-to-home-arena-packed-with-fans/,,,,VANCOUVER - The Vancouver Canucks have missed their fans.

It’s been nearly 600 days since the club has played a regular-season game in front of a home crowd, a stretch that’s set to end Tuesday when Vancouver hosts the Minnesota Wild. Goalie Thatcher Demko remembers the last time he and his teammates heard the cheers of a packed Rogers Arena. It was back on March 10, 2020 when the Canucks snatched a 5-4 shootout win over New York Islanders in front of an 18,871-strong crowd. “It’s crazy to think that we haven’t seen our fans in that long,” Demko said Monday. “I know everyone’s excited about it, we’ve been talking about it. We were getting a little itchy on the road there, wanting to get home and play some home games here.” Much has changed over the past 19 months. Fans in attendance Tuesday will be required to wear masks and show vaccine passports, ideas that sounded more like science fiction than everyday reality back in March 2020. For Demko, though, there’s one thread running through both games. “I was joking with my dad because he was at that (March 2020) game and he’s actually in town right now and I was like ‘Geeze, it’s been a long time. You were at the last game with friends and you’ll be at the one where we get them back, too.’ So that’s kind of cool,” the goalie said. While most NHL teams have already experienced the thrill of a home game this season, the Canucks (3-2-1) kicked off their campaign with a six-game road swing. They capped the trip with a 4-2 win over the Seattle Kraken on Saturday. “It’s not a lot of times that you start with a six-game trip and I like how we prevailed through it and got through it and played pretty well,” said Canucks head coach Travis Green. Saturday’s victory marked the first-ever home game for the Kraken, the NHL’s newest franchise. It was also the third home opener Vancouver has played this season. Each was an exciting game in a hostile environment, Demko said. “The fans are such a massive element to what we do on a nightly basis, whether we’re at home or on the road,” he said. It’s an element some players missed last season, when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the Canucks — and many other NHL teams — to play in empty arenas against the same teams again and again. Fans have a significant impact on games, said Vancouver centre Elias Pettersson. “It’s like an extra player almost,” he said. “Last year made me realize fans play a big part in just getting you going in a game. So the fans, they play a big part.” Last week, the B.C. government announced it was lifting capacity limits on indoor sporting events, starting Monday as the province’s new vaccine passport regulations came into effect. The move means the Canucks can have 100 per cent capacity for Tuesday’s home opener, though tickets were still available as of Monday afternoon. Having a full building will be exciting for the whole team, said coach Green. “Not only coming off a road trip, a long road trip here, you’re always excited to get home and play in front of fans,” he said. “It’s been so long. It’s going to be a lot of energy in our building.” The Canucks and Wild haven’t face one another since August 2020, when Vancouver beat Minnesota in a four-game series held in the NHL’s post-season “bubble” in Edmonton. The Wild (4-1-0) have looked strong early this season, winning four straight before dropping a 5-2 decision to the Nashville Predators on Sunday. The visitors will be hungry for a win, Green said. “(Tuesday’s) game is going to be a tough game. Minnesota’s got a lot of depth, they’ve got a lot of sides and they can skate,” he said. “They’re playing with some confidence and some swagger which you would be when you have a start like that.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published Oct. 25, 2021.

Across the country, universities are implementing various vaccination, masking and distancing policies; however, there's little evidence about the risk of the spread of COVID-19 at social gatherings among university students to guide schools' policies. A new analysis by a researcher at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), published in JAMA Network Open , finds a link between large gatherings of unvaccinated county residents—both students and non-students—and an increase in COVID-19 infections in the university's community. Ashley L. O'Donoghue, Ph.D., an economist at the Center for Healthcare Delivery Science and a research fellow in the Department of Medicine at BIDMC, looked at the new daily COVID-19 infections in counties with universities across the country from January to May of 2021. Next, she compared COVID-19 infection rates in counties with universities that participated in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) March Madness to those in counties with no link to the tournament. ""Counties that are home to universities that participated in NCAA March Madness saw a temporary increase in COVID-19 cases beginning eight days following the tournament and peaking 24 days after the tournament, relative to counties not involved in the tournament,"" said O'Donoghue. ""While many universities have decided to implement vaccination mandates, not all universities have. This study fills a gap in evidence on the risk of COVID-19 spread from social gatherings among unvaccinated university students . This suggests that vaccinations, surveillance testing of unvaccinated students, or other mitigation measures, are still important to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in a university's community."" O'Donoghue noted that universities participating in March Madness that were concerned about potential COVID-19 transmission may have increased surveillance testing during and after the tournament and thus documented more COVID-19 infections during this time than other counties. However, this study provides evidence that social gatherings among unvaccinated university students are associated with increased COVID-19 infections in a university's community, useful information for universities currently debating vaccination and/or surveillance testing policies for their campuses, O'Donoghue said.

Supporters of paid sick leave in B.C. advocate from Vancouver and Victoria,https://vancouver.citynews.ca/2021/10/24/vancouver-victoria-paid-sick-leave/,,['alylaube'],,People in Vancouver and Victoria who want B.C. to give workers 10 paid sick days took to the streets Monday to rally for action from the Horgan government.,"A so-called “COVID-safe Day of Action” is taking place Monday in Metro Vancouver and Victoria, with groups hoping to pressure the Horgan government to follow through with its plans to bring in mandatory paid sick leave for workers. Raj Khunkhun, VP with Community Savings Credit Union, says his organization is advocating for 10 paid sick days. “We’re lagging behind comparable countries like New Zealand and Australia. They already introduced 10 paid sick days. Germany actually has 30,” he said. “The federal government is poised to bring in 10 paid sick days for federally regulated workers, so we think B.C. should introduce 10 paid sick days as well.” Related Articles: B.C. seeks input on length of paid sick leave Some B.C. businesses still resistant to paid sick leave: CFIB Health-care workers demand Trudeau fast track paid sick-leave policy The Horgan government is expected to pass legislation before the end of the year to bring in paid sick leave, despite opposition from certain groups — including the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. But Khunkhun says having provincially-mandated paid sick days isn’t going to deter businesses. “We have always provided 12 paid sick days, but we provided a further 10 paid sick days during the pandemic, very early on, and also an additional six hours a week off just to get groceries because the line-ups were long,” said Khunkhun. They found there was no impact to their bottom line and had their most profitable year to-date. “We don’t want people to have to decide between getting paid fully and putting others at risk. We don’t think that should be a burden on the worker. They should also be able to take the time off, and that will also help our healthcare system, which is already really stressed right now,” added Khunkhun.",2021-10-25 00:59:19,,https://vancouver.citynews.ca/wp-content/blogs.dir/sites/9/2021/01/sneeze-1431371.jpg,citynews1130

BYU’s win over Wazzu a confidence-builder ahead of former coach Bronco Mendenhall coming to town,https://www.deseret.com/2021/10/24/22741210/byu-football-bronco-mendenhall-kalani-sitake-clark-barrington-brennan-armstrong-malik-moore,,['Jay Drew'],,,"BYU running back Tyler Allgeier, right, carries the ball while pressured by Washington State linebacker Jahad Woods during the second half of an NCAA college football game, Saturday, Oct. 23, 2021, in Pullman, Wash. | Young Kwak, Associated Press Having gone 4-0 against Pac-12 teams with the 21-19 win over Washington State, BYU turns its attention to one of the nation’s top offenses in explosive Virginia Offensive lineman Clark Barrington climbed onto the railing at Martin Stadium to salute the thousands of BYU fans who made the trip to the Palouse to watch their beloved Cougars play, including a couple dozen relatives and family friends. Defensive back Malik Moore joked after dropping a couple interceptions — easier to do after a win and one successful pick, no doubt — and bruising running back Tyler Allgeier said he was as sore as he’s ever been after a game. Thirty-two carries, including seven straight when everybody in the place knew the ball was going to BYU’s best player and he ran it down Wazzu’s throat anyway, will do that to a guy. “We knew that we would face adversity, and one thing we have been focusing on all week is getting through that adversity and staying up and helping each other out and pushing along. So that is what the vibe was in the locker room — that we are going to get through this, we are going to continue to drive the ball, our defense will do their best to get stops, and we will come out on top.” — BYU offensive lineman Clark Barrington For this resilient bunch of Cougars, Saturday’s 21-19 win over Washington State came as a relief as much as anything else. BYU became the only team in the country to beat four Pac-12 teams to date, but this victory was more about building its own confidence, after a two-game losing skid put BYU in what head coach Kalani Sitake called “a slump.” Imagine what Arizona coaches are calling their 19-game slide. Whatever the case, this is a win BYU desperately needed, what with Bronco Mendenhall and his 6-2 Virginia Cavaliers coming back to Provo this week for an 8:15 p.m. late-night special Saturday at LaVell Edwards Stadium. “Getting a win, it always boosts your confidence, and so it is nice to have another win,” said Barrington, the left guard who teamed with left tackle Blake Freeland to clear the way for Allgeier to pick up 9 yards on his final carry and secure the first down so BYU wouldn’t have to call on Spokane native Ryan Rehkow to pin WSU deep in the final minute. Added Moore, the ballhawking safety who invited social media followers after the game to needle him all they wanted for the drops — for one day: “I think for sure it picks up our confidence a lot, and shows us we are not out of it, we are no scrubs, you know?,” he said. “I think everybody’s chin was down, worrying about the last two games. This game really proved to us that we still got it, we are still a good team, we have won six games. Not a lot of teams are doing that, so we’re good.” In getting bowl eligible before Halloween — an unexpected development for a team that lost Zach Wilson and more than a dozen other key contributors — the Cougars are sort of playing with house money from here on out, with Virginia and USC looming as the only possible stumbling blocks to a 10-win season.

Credit defensive coordinator Ilaisa Tuiaki for designing a game plan that held Wazzu to 257 passing yards and 19 points. “We lost to a good team,” said WSU tackle Abraham Lucas. “We didn’t roll over, either. I think a lot of people nationwide and even (in Pullman) probably expected us to just roll over and die.” BYU didn’t. “I thought they had tons of energy,” Sitake said of the crimson Cougars. “It was a lot of fun. I feel really fortunate and happy that we got the win.” Allgeier, who is now seventh in the country in rushing yards (861) and sixth in rushing touchdowns (11), said another win in Pac-12 territory was just what the doctor ordered before what is sure to be an emotional game against Mendenhall and company. “I would say it brings the confidence back up,” Allgeier said. “We are 0-0 now, but we gotta keep that momentum going forward.” It won’t be easy against the Hoos, who beat Georgia Tech 48-40 on Saturday in Charlottesville and have won four straight behind the sensational quarterbacking of Brennan Armstrong. The 6-foot-2, 215-pound junior from Shelby, Ohio, leads the country in passing yards (3,220) and is second in passing yards per game (402.5). Virginia is fourth in the country in total offense, putting up 539.9 yards per game with former BYU offensive coordinator Robert Anae doing the play-calling. Defensively, though, the Hoos are below average. They are giving up 432.8 yards per game, which ranks them 105th in the country. They are especially susceptible to the run — ranking 113th in rushing defense. The Cougars enter Mendenhall’s homecoming a bit shorthanded, as starting center James Empey and starting receiver Gunner Romney left the WSU win with injuries and didn’t return. Sitake said both are “doubtful” to play this week. Right tackle Harris LaChance has been out for several weeks, but freshman Campbell Barrington has filled in admirably.

Pac-12 men’s basketball preview: Can league capitalize on record-setting NCAA Tournament performances?,https://www.deseret.com/2021/10/25/22732726/pac-12-basketball-preview-utah-utes-coach-craig-smith-commissioner-george-kliavkoff-jamie-zaninovich,,['Jay Drew'],,,"UCLA players celebrate after an Elite 8 game against Michigan at Lucas Oil Stadium, Wednesday, March 31, 2021, in Indianapolis. UCLA won 51-49. With all their key contributors returning this season, the Bruins are sure to be a tough out for the Utes and the other Pac-12 teams this season. | Darron Cummings, Associated Press New Runnin’ Utes coach Craig Smith enters a Pac-12 basketball race that is as deep and loaded as ever after impressive NCAA Tournament showing in 2021 SAN FRANCISCO — A razor-close overtime loss to undefeated Gonzaga in a Final Four game. Three teams in the Elite Eight. Four teams in the Sweet 16. Five teams in the Round of 32. A conference-record 13 total wins in the 2021 NCAA Tournament. Add it all up, and it begs the question: What will Pac-12 men’s basketball teams do for an encore in the 2022 Big Dance after the most successful overall showing in conference history last March? “We have great reasons for optimism in the Pac-12,” deputy commissioner and chief operating officer Jamie Zaninovich said at the league’s men’s basketball media day last week at conference headquarters in San Francisco. “The collective commitment to basketball throughout the conference is very important. Our shared objective is to optimize tournament bids and ultimately cut down the nets as national champions.” — Pac-12 commissioner George Kliavkoff The good news for the league is that many of the top players who helped turn the conference’s unexpected success into the story of March Madness last spring are back for more this year. Although only two Pac-12 teams made The Associated Press Top 25 preseason poll released Monday — UCLA is at No. 2 and Oregon is at No. 13 — the league is seemingly gaining more respect with each passing year. Arizona, USC and Colorado received votes, along with BYU, which will play two Pac-12 teams this year — Utah and Oregon. “We are excited about the momentum we have from last season, and confident in the talented student-athletes and great leadership from our coaches,” said new Pac-12 commissioner George Kliavkoff last week. “The collective commitment to basketball throughout the conference is very important. Our shared objective is to optimize tournament bids and ultimately cut down the nets as national champions.” That hasn’t been done since Lute Olson’s Arizona Wildcats won it all in 1997. Into that momentum, and improvement after some lackluster Big Dance showings from 2017-2019, steps new University of Utah coach Craig Smith. The only other new coach is Arizona’s Tommy Lloyd, the former top assistant under Mark Few at Gonzaga. “Certainly, being a part of this amazing conference — the Pac-12, the Conference of Champions, is what they say. Or at least somebody does. To be a part of that is awesome. It is something you want to be a part of, right?,” Smith said, flanked by returnees Branden Carlson and Riley Battin, when it was Utah’s turn to address the media on Oct. 13. “Bring on the competition.” Actually, the league has been trending up since 2020, when up to six teams were expected to get NCAA Tournament bids before the Big Dance was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But few saw the 2021 success coming. In retrospect, every team was probably under-seeded, from Final Four participant UCLA — which upset BYU in a first-round game — to surprise conference tournament champion Oregon State to USC, Colorado and Oregon (which was eliminated by another Pac-12 school, USC). “To finally see the Pac-12 in men’s basketball capture the attention of the basketball world, in March Madness, is truly remarkable and again, a testament to our student-athletes, coaches, administrators, everybody,” Zaninovich said. Some of the league’s NCAA Tournament failures in past years, or unimpressive showings in nonconference games, have been explained away by league officials as the conference having too many one-and-done players leaving early for the NBA. That didn’t happen this offseason, as preseason all-conference selections Johnny Juzang of UCLA, Warith Alatishe of Oregon State, Marcus Bagley of Arizona State and Isaiah Mobley of USC opted to return, “when they had pro opportunities in front of them, but chose to come back to school and invest in their collegiate experience,” Zaninovich said. As it were, the league produced three NBA lottery picks in 2021 — more than any other conference. Four all-freshman team players returned, and will be joined by 10 all-conference transfers, including MAC Player of the Year Marreon Jackson, the former Toledo star who is moving on to Arizona State. Zaninovich said four McDonald’s All-Americans will join the Pac-12 this year, and 12 players from ESPN’s Top 100 recruits list. Smith and Lloyd join a group of coaches who have more than 3,000 wins and 148 years of coaching experience. “The coaching in this league is obviously remarkable,” Zaninovich said. What else does the 2021-22 season hold for the Pac-12? Officials announced that the Pac-12 championship game at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas will tip off in prime time on the East Coast and will be televised by Fox. Also, the Pac-12 will host an NCAA Regional at the Chase Center in San Francisco — the first time in 80 years that San Francisco will host an NCAA Tournament game, the last one having been played at nearby Treasure Island. This will be the second season in which Pac-12 schools will play 20 conference games each. Before that, there will be some huge opportunities for Pac-12 teams to get big national wins. Stanford, Oregon and Arizona State will all get a shot at defending national champion Baylor; Washington and UCLA will play preseason AP No. 1 Gonzaga. Also, Oregon will play in the Maui Invitational and ASU will play in the Battle 4 Atlantis with opportunities to run across top-ranked teams in later rounds. Pac-12 teams will meet power-conference teams at least 20 times, including Utah’s Nov. 20 game against the ACC’s Boston College at the Sunshine Slam in Daytona Beach, Florida. The Runnin’ Utes will also face the SEC’s Missouri on Dec. 18 in Columbia, Missouri, the Big 12’s TCU on Dec. 8 in Fort Worth, Texas, and will host Big 12-bound BYU on Nov. 27 at the Huntsman Center in games that will either add to, or detract from, the league’s improved reputation as a national player. Zaninovich said the league has worked hard to help schools with their nonconference scheduling to figure out what makes the most sense for them. The goal is to have Pac-12 teams win at least 75% of their nonconference games. “We looked at tons of data of the NCAA Tournament, historically, and in most every case, if a conference wins 75% of its nonconference games, at least 50% of their teams advance to the NCAA Tournament,” Zaninovich said. Here’s a closer look at each team’s prospects in 2021-22, in order of how they were selected to finish in the preseason media poll: 1. UCLA Darron Cummings, Associated Press UCLA guard Tyger Campbell, right, celebrates with teammate guard Jaime Jaquez Jr. (4) after an Elite 8 game against Michigan in the NCAA men’s college basketball tournament at Lucas Oil Stadium, in Indianapolis on Wednesday, March 31, 2021. UCLA won 51-49. UCLA is an overwhelming favorite to win the Pac-12 after reaching the Final Four last season. All five starters and every other contributor to the Bruins’ Final Four run returned for coach Mick Cronin, making UCLA an easy pick to win the league. Starters such as Juzang, Tyger Campbell, Jules Bernard, Cody Riley and Jaime Jaquez Jr. will be joined by key newcomers Peyton Watson, Will McClendon and Rutgers transfer Myles Johnson to give the Bruins arguably the best team in the country. “Conference success in our sport is important because of NCAA Tournament bids,” Cronin said at media day. “We are all playing to go to the NCAA Tournament, and getting quality seeds. So conference power, success, all of it, is huge. … I think we proved last year that Pac-12 basketball is powerful.” Juzang and Jaquez said there’s a heightened sense of excitement in Westwood these days, thanks to that tournament run. “We are just as excited as them,” Juzang said. Cronin said the Bruins have “the greatest tradition” in the history of college basketball and feel more pressure to live up to that standard than to repeat last year’s run. 2. Oregon Jeff Roberson, Associated Press Oregon guard Will Richardson drives to the basket ahead of Southern California guard Drew Peterson during Sweet 16 game in the NCAA men’s college basketball tournament at Bankers Life Fieldhouse, Sunday, March 28, 2021, in Indianapolis. Richardson will be back for the Ducks in 2021-22, and is considered one of the better point guards in the league. The Ducks lost quality players Chris Duarte, LJ Figueroa and Eugene Omoruyi, but did well in the transfer portal market, landing Syracuse’s Quincy Guerrier, Oklahoma’s De’Vion Harmon and Jacob Young of Rutgers. They will join one of the Pac-12’s better returning point guards, Will Richardson, to give coach Dana Altman another league championship contender. Former American Fork star Isaac Johnson, a 7-footer, will join the program after having served a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints the past two years. Altman was asked at media day how much longer he will stay in coaching. “I don’t have anything else,” he said. “I am 63. I would like to go on as long as Oregon will have me. … I don’t know what I would do if I didn’t go to the gym every day.” 3. USC (AP Photo/Paul Sancya, Associated Press USC forward Evan Mobley (4) and USC forward Isaiah Mobley (3) watch from the bench during game against Kansas in the second round of the NCAA Tournament at Hinkle Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, Monday, March 22, 2021. While Evan has moved on to the NBA (the No. 3 overall pick in the 2021 NBA draft) Isaiah returns to the Trojans this season. A lot of experts say the Trojans will sorely miss Evan Mobley, the No. 3 pick in July’s NBA draft. They will. But they will also miss reliable guard Tahj Eaddy, the Santa Clara transfer who helped USC eliminate Utah 91-85 in double overtime in the Pac-12 quarterfinals last spring. Coach Andy Enfield does get back Mobley’s brother, Isaiah, and point guard Ethan Anderson and wings Isaiah White and Drew Peterson. Forwards Max Agbonkpolo and Chavez Goodwin also return, which is why USC should make the Big Dance again. “We have a lot of versatilely, but our guards have to be good for us if we hope to get back,” Enfield said.”… The excitement around our program is at an all-time high since I have been here the last eight seasons.” Memphis transfer Boogie Ellis brings his 10.2 scoring average to the team. The coach said the Pac-12’s showing in the tournament “gave our conference a tremendous boost. We were rooting for everyone else as if it were our own program.” T4. Arizona Jeff Chiu, Associated Press Arizona coach Tommy Lloyd waves while speaking during Pac-12 media day Wednesday, Oct. 13, 2021, in San Francisco. Lloyd and Utah’s Craig Smith are the two newcomer coaches to the league this season. Sure, the Wildcats have the winning tradition to fall back on, but this pick from media members who cover the Pac-12 seems high (the Deseret News picked Arizona ninth on its ballot). As mentioned previously, new coach Lloyd saw a lot of winning in more than 20 years at Gonzaga, but Ws don’t figure to come as easily in Tucson for awhile. “I might have to recalibrate what a good winning percentage feels like,” Lloyd said. “I am really looking forward to that journey where every game is going to be a battle.” Lloyd said at Gonzaga if they lost a West Coast Conference game, “it felt like you lost a seed line” for the NCAA Tournament. Bennedict Mathurin, Azuolas Tubelis and Kerr Kriisa stuck around after Sean Miller was fired, and Utah transfer Pelle Larsson should be able to step in and contribute immediately. “We have a great young nucleus to work with,” Lloyd said. T4. Oregon State Amanda Loman, Associated Press Oregon State’s Warith Alatishe shoots over Utah’s Riley Battin during game in Corvallis, Ore., Thursday, Feb. 18, 2021. Much to Oregon State coach Wayne Tinkle’s delight, Alatishe will be back for the Beavers. Before that magical three-weekend stretch in March when they won the Pac-12 Tournament and advanced to the Elite Eight, the Beavers were an average team, perhaps even less than that. Can they recapture that momentum? Coach Wayne Tinkle was able to keep most of his best players — most notably Alatishe, supreme shooter Jarod Lucas and backcourt mate Gianni Hunt. Replacing floor leader Ethan Thompson will be difficult. “This conference is going to be as deep as it has ever been,” Tinkle said, hinting that even though the Beavers have improved, the rest of the league has as well, and duplicating that run will be difficult. 6. Colorado Michael Conroy, Associated Press Colorado forward Evan Battey celebrates during a timeout against Georgetown in NCAA first-round game at Hinkle Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, Saturday, March 20, 2021. Battey will be back for the Buffs in 2021-22. Point guard McKinley Wright IV was a fixture in Boulder the past four years, and will be extremely hard to replace. But coach Tad Boyle said he likes this group, especially if a highly rated incoming freshman class contributes. The Buffs’ best returners are big man Evan Battey, forward Jabari Walker and guard Eli Parquet, who helped CU go 14-6 in league play and earn a No., 5 seed in the NCAA Tournament. Colorado reached the Round of 32 and was the only Pac-12 entrant that didn’t win two or more contests in March Madness. “We are in great shape leadership-wise, but we gotta grow up quickly,” Boyle said. 7. Arizona State Rick Scuteri, Associated Press Arizona State coach Bobby Hurley talks to Marcus Bagley during game against Arizona, Thursday, Jan. 21, 2021, in Tempe, Ariz. Convincing Bagley to return was a big win for the ASU coach. Coach Bobby Hurley scored two major wins in the offseason, getting talented forward Bagley to stick around for at least another year and luring MAC Player of the Year Marreon Jackson of Toledo to Tempe. Jackson, who averaged 18.1 points, 6.1 rebounds and 5.9 assists for the Rockets last year, will team with Ohio State transfer Luther Muhammad and Boston College transfer Jay Heath and returnees Bagley, Kimani Lawrence and Enoch Boakye to give Hurley plenty of talent with which to work. After ASU went 11-14 last year, 7-10 in the Pac-12, Hurley said watching fellow conference mates succeed in the tournament was invigorating. “I was so happy for the league, and for those colleagues, those coaches,” he said. Bagley, a 6-foot-8 sophomore, said his decision to return was “based on knowing how much better I could be.” 8. Washington State Pete Caster, Associated Press Washington State head coach Kyle Smith reacts after a foul was called during game against Stanford, Saturday, Feb. 20, 2021, in Pullman, Wash. Slowly but surely, Smith is bringing respectability to the Cougars program. The Cougars are a popular pick among some to make the NCAA Tournament for the first time in awhile, because coach Kyle Smith is slowly building something in Pullman. Wazzu returns its main rotation — led by Efe Abogidi, Dishon Jackson and Noah Williams — and should be bolstered by South Alabama transfer Michael Flowers (21.0 ppg.) and UC San Diego transfer Tyrell Roberts (19.2 ppg.), who joined Abogidi and Smith at media day. “He’s a bucket,” Smith said of the 5-11 Roberts. Having gone 7-12 in league play last year, the Cougars will hang their hat on defense once again, Smith said. “I think our talent is there,” he said. “Experience is still lacking, we are still quite youthful.” 9. Stanford David Zalubowski, Associated Press Stanford forward Jaiden Delaire, left, drives during game against Colorado Saturday, Jan. 16, 2021, in Boulder, Colo. Delaire will be among the Cardinal players trying to keep Stanford coach Jerod Haase on the sidelines this season. While Utah coach Larry Krystkowiak was clearly on the hot seat last year, and ended up losing his job, the Pac-12 coach who wears that description this year is Stanford’s Jerod Haase, along with Washington’s Mike Hopkins, perhaps. The Cardinal lost a lot, most notably Oscar da Silva, Zaire Williams and Daejon Davis, and will do well to make the tournament for the first time since 2014. Senior Jaiden Delaire, junior Spencer Jones and five-star recruit Harrison Ingram will attempt to help Haase keep his job. “Our goal is to simple — it is to be awesome,” Haase said. That might be what it takes to keep the sixth-year coach in Palo Alto for another year. 10. Utah Jeff Chiu, Associated Press Utah coach Craig Smith, left, speaks next to Riley Battin, middle, and Branden Carlson during Pac-12 media day Wednesday, Oct. 13, 2021, in San Francisco. While expectations for the Utes are not high in Smith’s first year at the helm, the players said at media day that the Utes will surprise some people in 2021-22. For the record, the Deseret News picked the Utes to finish seventh. The mass exodus since Krystkowiak was fired on March 16 has been well-documented, but Smith was able to keep Carlson and Battin in the fold (after Battin briefly entered the transfer portal) and those two said at media day that the Runnin’ Utes will surprise some people in 2021-22. “I will say this: We have gotten a lot better in a short amount of time, and I can’t wait to see where this team goes,” Smith said at media day. The feeling here is that UNLV grad transfer David Jenkins Jr. will give the Utes a nice scoring lift, and Utah State transfers Marco Anthony and Rollie Worster will add some defensive toughness that was lacking last year. “There is a lot of depth in our backcourt,” Smith said. “The words that describe our backcourt are selfless and skilled. They can shoot it, they can pass it, they can dribble it, and for the most part we are pretty tough defensively with a good feel for the game.” 11. Washington Ted S. Warren, Associated Press California guard Jarred Hyder (3) is defended by Washington forward Nate Roberts (1) as guards Jamal Bey (5) and Marcus Tsohonis (0) watch during game Saturday, Feb. 20, 2021, in Seattle. The Huskies went 15-3 in Pac-12 play in 2018-19, but have been a disaster since then, going 9-29 in league play since. The aforementioned Hopkins seemingly needs a big turnaround to keep his job. Starters Jamal Bey and Nate Roberts return, but most of the other expected contributors are transfers — guys such as Terrell Brown Jr. (Arizona), Daejon Davis (Stanford) and Emmitt Mathews Jr. (West Virginia). “We took advantage of the transfer portal,” Hopkins said. 12. California Jeff Chiu, Associated Press California forward Andre Kelly shoots against Oregon during game in Berkeley, Calif., Saturday, Feb. 27, 2021. Kelly is the Bears’ leading returning scorer. Coach Mark Fox’s best player last year, former Wasatch Academy star Matt Bradley, has transferred to San Diego State. He will be missed. Andre Kelly (10.3 ppg.) and Grant Anticevich (8.9 ppg.) are back, and are joined by Charlotte transfer Jordan Shepherd. The Bears will play at UNLV on Nov. 13 in what should be a barometer game; they will also play Florida in the Rocket Mortgage Fort Myers Tip-Off and either Ohio State or Seton Hall in the second round. “We have a nonconference schedule that is going to help us play in the best conference in America,” Fox said.",2021-10-25 16:15:22,"SAN FRANCISCO — A razor-close overtime loss to undefeated Gonzaga in a Final Four game. Three teams in the Elite Eight. Four teams in the Sweet 16. Five teams in the Round of 32. A conference-record 13 total wins in the 2021 NCAA Tournament. Add it all up, and it begs the question: What will Pac-12 men’s basketball teams do for an encore in the 2022 Big Dance after the most successful overall showing in conference history last March? “We have great reasons for optimism in the Pac-12,” deputy commissioner and chief operating officer Jamie Zaninovich said at the league’s men’s basketball media day last week at conference headquarters in San Francisco. “The collective commitment to basketball throughout the conference is very important. Our shared objective is to optimize tournament bids and ultimately cut down the nets as national champions.” — Pac-12 commissioner George Kliavkoff The good news for the league is that many of the top players who helped turn the conference’s unexpected success into the story of March Madness last spring are back for more this year. Although only two Pac-12 teams made The Associated Press Top 25 preseason poll released Monday — UCLA is at No. 2 and Oregon is at No. 13 — the league is seemingly gaining more respect with each passing year. Arizona, USC and Colorado received votes , along with BYU, which will play two Pac-12 teams this year — Utah and Oregon. “We are excited about the momentum we have from last season, and confident in the talented student-athletes and great leadership from our coaches,” said new Pac-12 commissioner George Kliavkoff last week. “The collective commitment to basketball throughout the conference is very important. Our shared objective is to optimize tournament bids and ultimately cut down the nets as national champions.” That hasn’t been done since Lute Olson’s Arizona Wildcats won it all in 1997. Into that momentum, and improvement after some lackluster Big Dance showings from 2017-2019, steps new University of Utah coach Craig Smith . The only other new coach is Arizona’s Tommy Lloyd, the former top assistant under Mark Few at Gonzaga. “Certainly, being a part of this amazing conference — the Pac-12, the Conference of Champions, is what they say. Or at least somebody does. To be a part of that is awesome. It is something you want to be a part of, right?,” Smith said, flanked by returnees Branden Carlson and Riley Battin , when it was Utah’s turn to address the media on Oct. 13. “Bring on the competition.” Actually, the league has been trending up since 2020, when up to six teams were expected to get NCAA Tournament bids before the Big Dance was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Related How will new Runnin’ Utes coach Craig Smith fare in the Pac-12? Some experts weigh in But few saw the 2021 success coming. In retrospect, every team was probably under-seeded, from Final Four participant UCLA — which upset BYU in a first-round game — to surprise conference tournament champion Oregon State to USC, Colorado and Oregon (which was eliminated by another Pac-12 school, USC). “To finally see the Pac-12 in men’s basketball capture the attention of the basketball world, in March Madness, is truly remarkable and again, a testament to our student-athletes, coaches, administrators, everybody,” Zaninovich said. Some of the league’s NCAA Tournament failures in past years, or unimpressive showings in nonconference games, have been explained away by league officials as the conference having too many one-and-done players leaving early for the NBA. That didn’t happen this offseason, as preseason all-conference selections Johnny Juzang of UCLA, Warith Alatishe of Oregon State, Marcus Bagley of Arizona State and Isaiah Mobley of USC opted to return, “when they had pro opportunities in front of them, but chose to come back to school and invest in their collegiate experience,” Zaninovich said. As it were, the league produced three NBA lottery picks in 2021 — more than any other conference. Four all-freshman team players returned, and will be joined by 10 all-conference transfers, including MAC Player of the Year Marreon Jackson, the former Toledo star who is moving on to Arizona State. Zaninovich said four McDonald’s All-Americans will join the Pac-12 this year, and 12 players from ESPN’s Top 100 recruits list. Smith and Lloyd join a group of coaches who have more than 3,000 wins and 148 years of coaching experience. Related Runnin’ Utes unfazed by being picked so low in suddenly deep Pac-12 “The coaching in this league is obviously remarkable,” Zaninovich said. What else does the 2021-22 season hold for the Pac-12? Officials announced that the Pac-12 championship game at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas will tip off in prime time on the East Coast and will be televised by Fox. Also, the Pac-12 will host an NCAA Regional at the Chase Center in San Francisco — the first time in 80 years that San Francisco will host an NCAA Tournament game, the last one having been played at nearby Treasure Island. This will be the second season in which Pac-12 schools will play 20 conference games each. Before that, there will be some huge opportunities for Pac-12 teams to get big national wins. Stanford, Oregon and Arizona State will all get a shot at defending national champion Baylor; Washington and UCLA will play preseason AP No. 1 Gonzaga. Also, Oregon will play in the Maui Invitational and ASU will play in the Battle 4 Atlantis with opportunities to run across top-ranked teams in later rounds. Pac-12 teams will meet power-conference teams at least 20 times, including Utah’s Nov. 20 game against the ACC’s Boston College at the Sunshine Slam in Daytona Beach, Florida. The Runnin’ Utes will also face the SEC’s Missouri on Dec. 18 in Columbia, Missouri, the Big 12’s TCU on Dec. 8 in Fort Worth, Texas, and will host Big 12-bound BYU on Nov. 27 at the Huntsman Center in games that will either add to, or detract from, the league’s improved reputation as a national player. Zaninovich said the league has worked hard to help schools with their nonconference scheduling to figure out what makes the most sense for them.

Picture: @SavannaCider/Twitter Savanna Cider Distell Group Email Print Tweet Share Matuba Mahlatjie | 13 hours ago JOHANNESBURG - Savanna drinkers won’t be left high and dry this coming festive season after some alcohol outlets confirmed that there was a shortage of the popular alcoholic beverage . The makers of the popular cider said that production had not stopped but that it had been slowed down by a global glass shortage exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. “We want to start by apologising and reassuring South Africans that millions of litres of your favourite cider is still being produced each week and allocated to local retailers to make sure that you do not miss your favourite crisp and dry cider, over the festive season. We are sorry for the low stock levels in stores but we are trying to keep up with you,” Eugene Lenford, marketing manager for the Savanna Cider said in a statement. The statement also said that shipping delays had also been impacted by the pandemic which had left a number of suppliers and producers on the back foot in the last twelve months. While makers of South Africa’s premium cider were apologetic for the shortage, they were also celebrating the growing demand for their product. “The demand for Savanna's range of premium ciders has exceeded supply for an extended period, but the premium cider producer is investing in additional capacity and working on a number of short, medium and long-term solutions to remedy this with glass and other suppliers to avoid future shortages.” Savanna drinkers have also been urged not to buy in bulk as plans are in place to recover and ensure a steady supply: “Savanna Premium Cider will continue to be available over the festive season in greater volumes than in previous years. We urge South Africans to be patient and are encouraged not to buy in bulk and to continue to only consume alcohol safely and responsibly,” the statement said.

Win McNamee/Getty Images hide caption A nurse draw a Moderna COVID-19 vaccine dose from a vial at the Cameron Grove Community Center in Bowie, Md., in late March. Moderna says study data supports use of a half-dose of the vaccine in children 6 to 11. Moderna says a study in kids 6 to 11 found two doses of the company's COVID-19 vaccine given 28 days apart produced a strong antibody response. The study, conducted in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health, used shots containing a 50 microgram dose of the vaccine, half the dose of the Moderna shots authorized for adults. More than 4,700 children ages 5 to 11 took part in the study. The most common side effects were fatigue, headache, fever and pain at the site of injection. The company says the analysis showed a ""favorable safety profile."" The summary of the study results was made available in a press release . The information hasn't been peer reviewed or published, but Moderna said it plans to submit them to a scientific journal for publication. The company also said it plans to submit the data to regulators, a move that would support the authorization of the vaccine for kids 6 to 11. The release of the data comes a day before a panel of advisers to the Food and Drug Administration will review use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in children 5 to 11 years of age. In June, Moderna submitted study results involving nearly 2,500 adolescents ages 12 to 15 to the FDA. The agency hasn't yet issued a decision on whether to expand use of the Moderna vaccine to that age group. In May, the FDA expanded authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to include adolescents 12 to 15 years of age.",,npr

Additionally, he noted he doesn't cut his 'impressive mullet' until after 'Survivor' Season 42.","Fans following Survivor Season 41 can’t help but notice more than a few changes. In addition to the many new twists and turns added into the game, Survivor host Jeff Probst is also sporting a new look. He spoke in an interview regarding the longer hairstyle he’s sporting in the new season — and he noted it doesn’t change until the end of Survivor Season 42. Here’s what Probst had to say. ‘Survivor’ Season 41 follows intense coronavirus protocol Jeff Probst on ‘Survivor’ Season 41 | Robert Voets/CBS via Getty Images Host Jeff Probst promised Survivor Season 41 would be unlike any other season the show’s had so far. While past seasons had contestants playing the game for 39 days, the new coronavirus (COVID-19) protocol had season 41 contestants playing for only 26 days. Because of the shorter gameplay, Probst promised more twists, more turns, and tougher gameplay than ever before. “Survivor 41 will birth a new era of Survivor with a faster, more dangerous, and much more intense game,” Probst said, according to Parade. “We really leaned into having fun with this season and the best kind of Survivor fun is the dangerous kind.” The show followed additional coronavirus protocol as well to ensure the safety of the contestants and the production team. “We worked with the Fiji government to create what was essentially a large bubble that consisted of several islands — including tribe camps, challenge locations, Tribal Council, and base camp,” Probst explained to Entertainment Weekly. “This extended bubble would be our home for the next many months. Once every crew member and player had quarantined for 14 days and received a negative test, we were able to move freely between those islands, with no risk, because it was only our crew and we were all safe.” Jeff Probst said he doesn’t cut his hair until the end of ‘Survivor’ Season 42 I am thrilled to tell you all that @survivorcbs is going back into production and I will see you on the island for #Survivor 41! @CBS pic.twitter.com/RtQGVFoDDL— Jeff Probst (@JeffProbst) March 22, 2021 Viewers watching Survivor Season 41 noticed Jeff Probst’s long hair. And he’s well-aware of his new style as well. “[My] hair is longer because like so many of us, I didn’t get it cut during COVID,” Probst told Entertainment Weekly. “And as it grew, I was reminded how grateful I am to still have hair, so why not grow it! And then I decided to keep it.” Fans should get used to his long hair, too. Probst told Entertainment Weekly he wasn’t able to chop his hair until the end of Survivor Season 42. “On location, there was no way to cut it anyway, so by the end of Survivor 42, I have a pretty damn impressive mullet!” he added. Probst’s long hair goes along with his “Survivor Guy” persona, too. Probst noted he gets into this persona prior to daily challenges. “Weirdly, he looked a lot like me, only significantly cooler,” Probst explained to Entertainment Weekly regarding “Survivor Guy.” “He wore animal skins, had much longer hair, a lot of odd tattoos and a feather necklace. I’ll never forget his first words to me: “Jeff, I am Survivor Guy … I am your alter ego, and if you embrace what I have to offer I can make your life on Survivor better than ever.” When is ‘Survivor’ Season 42? Jeff Probst | Robert Voets/CBS via Getty Images While Survivor Season 41 feels as if it’s just begun, when is Survivor Season 42? According to Premiere Date, fans can expect season 42 to premiere on CBS in Spring 2022. Initial reports regarding the 42nd season noted production experienced delays. In April 2021, Fiji reportedly suspended international passenger flights. This allegedly affected the filming for season 42. It seems production was able to make up for any delays, though — and that could be, in part, due to the new 26-day gameplay. According to Jeff Probst, the show will continue with its new format changes for the foreseeable future. Hopefully, fans can continue to embrace the change. Check out Showbiz Cheat Sheet on Facebook!

Credit: WMOBy Claudia Sadoff and Joachim von BraunWASHINGTON DC, Oct 25 2021 (IPS) The global food system is facing more demands from society than ever before in modern times – and rightly so. From responding to the climate crisis to dealing with rising malnutrition and ensuring the sustainable use of natural resources and protection of biodiversity, the responsibility of our food systems is no longer just to “feed the world.” The recent action agenda released by the UN Secretary General at the Food Systems Summit not only highlighted this urgency but reminded us that our food systems are also one of our greatest hopes for making progress on these fronts. While the US$10 billion pledged by the United States to end hunger and malnutrition is a welcome start, our food systems have been forced to cope with an increasingly complex, interconnected set of challenges for too long – often without a corresponding shift in focus from governments and other key players. The changes required also need sufficient funding for food systems transformation, estimated to be in the range of $400 billion per year. This goal is within reach and is roughly comparable to three times New York City’s annual budget or less than 0.5 percent of world GDP in 2020. Food systems transformation also requires impactful innovations, so particular importance in this funding should therefore be placed on investment in research and innovation. Increased and sustained funding for research and innovation is crucial, as the world requires technological, policy and institutional innovation to address the increasingly complex set of challenges that are facing, and threatening, food, land and water systems in a climate crisis. Investments in agricultural research and innovation generate significant returns. Benefit-cost ratios of CGIAR research, for example, have shown consistent returns on investments to the order of 10:1. Despite this, international agricultural research remains underfunded, threatening food, economic, and environmental security around the world, whilst hunger and poverty continue to rise. In addition to securing funding for research and innovation, research itself must evolve to address the growing challenges around the world. In particular, research efforts should favour more circular business models that are driven by value, rather than volume, and those that promote resilience to shocks and balance with nature over more environmentally damaging models. We must also ensure that more research translates into concrete innovations that truly advance food systems transformation. While we desperately need technological innovations to increase productivity, reduce poverty, hunger and malnutrition, as well as climate proofing our food systems and making them more equitable, such innovations can only be taken forward if they are bundled with appropriate national policies, institutional changes and global actions, and strategies to deal with shocks and conflict. Sometimes the implementation of innovations inevitably involves trade-offs, not only synergies. Research and innovation efforts will be crucial to understanding and managing such trade-offs, as well as to help ensure that interconnected challenges are tackled in the most efficient and holistic way. To both achieve and maximize the potential of research and innovation, governments of the world should consider allocating just one per cent of the portion of their national GDP that relates to food systems, towards research and innovation. At present, many countries, including many of the world’s richest, only spend half of this. For the least developed countries, aid will be needed to reach such a level, potentially through a special trust fund backed by the International Monetary Fund’s Special Drawing Rights (SDRs). Such a fund, when properly backed by developed countries, would help to support greater scientific capacity on the ground in low- and middle-income countries, which will be needed if we are to address the challenges facing the whole world, not just the developed world. Today’s agri-food systems no longer simply feed people. They must also provide nutrition, promote livelihoods, protect the environment, and tackle climate change – often all at once. Financing and unlocking innovations are needed to address these challenges together. If our food, land and water systems are ever able to achieve society’s mounting demands, we must ensure our priorities are in order and begin to properly finance them. Ultimately, all of the ambition generated around the UN Food Systems Summit will fall short if we fail to finance the new research and innovation we know we need.

‘Curb Your Enthusiasm’: Larry David’s Biggest Annoyance in Premiere Was This Aspect of COVID-19,https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/curb-your-enthusiasm-larry-davids-biggest-annoyance-in-premiere-was-this-aspect-of-covid-19.html/,"['comedy', 'HBO', 'HBO Max']",['Whitney Danhauer'],,'Curb Your Enthusiasm' Season 11 shows us all that even though Larry David may have reveled in a pandemic lockdown there was something else that he found much more offensive.,"Curb Your Enthusiasm premiered on HBO Sunday, Oct. 24, and fans of the show were ready. We haven’t seen our favorite characters in the world of Larry David, who plays himself, since March of 2020. Honestly, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic seems like something Larry has a lot of opinions about. Surprisingly, the show didn’t go the route most people were expecting. [SPOILER ALERT: This article contains spoilers about the premiere episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm Season 11.] Larry David | Photograph by John P. Johnson/ HBO Larry David mainly was annoyed with the ‘COVID hoarders’ in the ‘Curb Your Enthusiasm’ premiere The premiere episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm Season 11 opens up with Larry finding a dead body floating in his pool. After conversing with the police, it turns out that Larry’s fence isn’t up to code. He could actually be liable for the death of the person robbing his house. However, while fans may have thought this would be the show’s focus, the episode managed to intertwine several plots into the premiere. At a meeting, Larry offers a colleague some Purell. He quickly makes it clear that he’s not one of those “COVID hoarders.” He’s talking about the people who bought large amounts of hand sanitizer and toilet paper at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic and caused a shortage in several areas.  Later in the episode, Larry discovers one of his good friends, Albert Brooks, is a “COVID hoarder.” He announces it to the huge crowd of people gathered at Albert’s house. Like a mob with pitchforks, the group turned on him. The rest of the scene plays out as Larry smugly shrugs from the bottom of the stairs, and Albert screams out, “Come back! I have flu shots!” No one saunters back into our lives quite like Lawrence Gene David. pic.twitter.com/NndmQho00n— HBO (@HBO) October 24, 2021 RELATED: ‘Curb Your Enthusiasm’: Is Leon Larry David’s Imaginary Friend? J.B. Smoove Weighs In On Their Relationship ‘Curb Your Enthusiasm’ cashes in on the tiniest nuances that irritate most people If finding awkward situations as humorous isn’t your thing, there’s a good chance you aren’t a fan of Larry David and Curb Your Enthusiasm. However, it’s the reality of his irritation that draws most people in. Whether we want to admit it or not, we all get annoyed by situations similar to the ones Larry experiences in the series. From someone holding up a line at the local ice cream parlor by trying too many samples to becoming annoyed with a friend for holding a “live funeral” so he can hear all the good things people would say about him before he dies – these are all moments, many of us would inwardly groan at. The difference between Larry and most of us is that Larry has no issues pointing these out. Sure, he can come across as a jerk. However, most of the time, there’s a little tapping in the back of your brain that makes you realize, “Well, yeah, he kind of has a point…” RELATED: ‘Curb Your Enthusiasm’: How Bob Einstein’s Marty Funkhouser Stayed a Part of the Show in Season 10 Larry David’s disdain for people plays out in the most delightful way One would think that Larry would revel in a pandemic lockdown with his hatred of people and all, but the premiere episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm Season 11 doesn’t mention it. To be fair, in the trailer for this season, we hear him tell someone, “I hate people individually, but I love mankind.” He may be a little cranky, he may be narcissistic, but he’s definitely the funniest person on TV right now.

""The reason for discontinuation of the administration of the vaccine is being done out of an abundance of caution that men who received Sputnik V may be at higher risk of contracting HIV when exposed to it,"" said the ministry.",,2021-10-24 16:00:00,,,manilatimes

SYDNEY, Oct 25 — Australian officials plan to roll out Covid-19 booster shots soon to prevent a resurgence of cases, as residents in the two largest cities of Sydney and Melbourne begin to enjoy more freedoms after months-long curbs.Australia has ditched its Covid-zero strategy in favour of suppressing the coronavirus, after largely stamping out infections for most of this year, and is now aiming to live with the virus through higher vaccinations.Officials are gradually shifting their focus to booster shots as double-dose vaccinations levels in Australia’s adult population nears 75 per cent. Almost 87 per cent of people above 16 have received their first dose since the national rollout began in February.“We think what is going to happen is that a booster shot will be made available from six months from your second dose,” Lieutenant General John Frewen, head of the vaccination taskforce, told the Australian Broadcasting Corp on Monday.Advice from the country’s immunisation advisory group on booster shots “is imminent”, he said, adding health workers, and staff and residents in aged care and disability centres would be offered the doses in the initial phase.Amid a surge in vaccinations, Victoria on Monday logged its lowest rise in daily infections in nearly three weeks at 1,461, while cases dipped for the fourth straight day in neighbouring New South Wales (NSW) to 294.Officials in Victoria are looking to ease more restrictions on gatherings and movement on Friday, just a week after Melbourne, the state capital, exited its sixth lockdown during the pandemic. Sydney lifted its lockdown two weeks ago.Double-dose vaccination rates in Victoria’s adult population will top 80 per cent by then — a level where masks will not be mandatory outdoors and people free to travel throughout the state.That rate neared 85 per cent in NSW, home to Sydney, with the state tipped to hit 90 per cent next week. The next set of restrictions will be eased on Dec. 1, when the lockdown rules will lift for the unvaccinated, according to the state’s reopening plan. — Reuters",2021-10-25 00:56:41,,,malaymail

She recognizes the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, but said she also understands her son is at a much lower risk for serious illness than older adults. “To me it’s not a clear benefit,” she said. Read more: ‘No middle ground’: How children’s COVID-19 vaccination is polarizing parents While many parents were overjoyed at the news that Health Canada is considering approval of the first COVID-19 vaccine for kids age five to 11 in Canada, parents like Hubert are feeling more trepidatious, and public health officials said they are going to have a much more nuanced conversation with parents about vaccination than they did with adults. Story continues below advertisement While 82 per cent of eligible Canadians aged 12 and up are already fully vaccinated, a recent survey by Angus Reid shows only 51 per cent of parents plan to immediately vaccinate their kids when a pediatric dose becomes available. Of parents with children in the five to 11 year age range, 23 per cent said they would never give their kids a COVID-19 vaccine, 18 per cent said they would wait, and nine per cent said they weren’t sure, according to the survey of 5,011 Canadians between Sept. 29 and Oct. 3, which cannot be assigned a margin of error because online surveys are not considered random samples. “Most of the research that I’ve seen sort of indicates that parents are more hesitant to vaccinate their kids against COVID than themselves,” said Kate Allen, a post-doctoral fellow at the Center for Vaccine Preventable Diseases of the University of Toronto. 2:18 Pfizer asks Health Canada to approve vaccine for kids aged 5 to 11 Pfizer asks Health Canada to approve vaccine for kids aged 5 to 11 There are several reasons parents might pause, she said. Story continues below advertisement It’s true that children are at a much lower risk of serious outcomes associated with COVID-19, and there have been very rare incidents of mRNA vaccines like Pfizer or Moderna linked to cases of myocarditis, a swelling of the heart muscle. As of Oct. 1, Health Canada has documented 859 cases associated with the vaccines, which mainly seem to affect people under 40 years old, and people who’ve developed the complication have typically been fine. “I know it’s rare, I know it’s not deadly, but I also see the risk of severe symptoms from COVID as being rare and not deadly for Jackson,” Hubert said when asked about weighing up the risks and benefits of the vaccine. Read more: Canada getting 2.9M COVID-19 shots for kids ‘shortly’ after approval But public health experts stress that some children do suffer from rare but serious impacts from COVID-19, which can also cause myocarditis as well as the little-understood impacts of the condition known as long COVID. They say parents should consider the less tangible benefits of vaccination as well. “It’s less of a conversation about a direct benefit to them, and more of a community benefit,” Allen said. The pandemic has taken a heavy toll on children, depriving them of school, time with their peers, extracurriculars _ and their mental health has suffered as a result, said Dr. Vinita Dubey, associate medical officer of health with Toronto Public Health. Story continues below advertisement “Not one child has been spared from this pandemic. I mean every single child has had to bear a sacrifice because of the pandemic in one way or the other,” Dubey said. 2:04 Half of Canadian parents with children aged 5-11 want them to be fully vaccinated Half of Canadian parents with children aged 5-11 want them to be fully vaccinated So far Pfizer-BioNtech is the only manufacturer to request approval for its pediatric COVID-19 vaccine and Health Canada is still reviewing the data. The regulator has promised the review will be thorough, and the vaccine will only be approved for children if the benefits outweigh the potential risks. Policy-makers know they’re going to have to take parents’ concerns seriously as well. On a recent tour of the Childrens’ Hospital of Eastern Ontario in Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with Dr. Anne Pham-Huy, a pediatric infectious diseases physician. Story continues below advertisement “Vaccine confidence is going to be the most important part of it this time around,” Pham-Huy said, to which Trudeau agreed. Dubey has published research on improving parents’ vaccine confidence when it comes to long-established inoculations like mumps and rubella. 2:35 Ontario gets ready to roll out COVID-19 vaccine for children once approved Ontario gets ready to roll out COVID-19 vaccine for children once approved While she offered several tips, they mainly come down to building trust. Her research focused on the role of family doctors, but she said during the pandemic anyone can be that trusted sounding board. “It could be a faith leader, it could be an important family member or friend, someone who you trust, to help guide you to the right sources to make that decision,” she said. Read more: U.S. FDA says Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine is safe, effective for kids aged 5-11 Story continues below advertisement With that in mind, several students from across North America launched a peer-to-peer education program called Students for Herd Immunity to allow kids to have those conversations among themselves. The public health experts agree, the debate around vaccines has become polarized and open conversations will be the key to addressing parents’ concerns. “I think one thing to say to parents is you don’t have to make your decision right away,” Dubey said. “I mean for those who are ready to make their decision, but it’s fine but if you have questions, seek the answers.” Her only advice is to get those answers from a trusted source, and not social media.

Gottlieb says kids could start getting COVID vaccine as soon as November 4,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-vaccine-kids-ages-5-11-november-gottlieb-face-the-nation/,,,,Gottlieb said the Biden administration is making the effort to push the vaccine directly into pediatricians' offices.,,2021-10-25 19:45:44,"Former FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb predicted Sunday on ""Face the Nation"" that the Biden administration could begin rolling out COVID-19 vaccines for children as soon as November 4 or 5, right after a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention panel will decide whether to allow Pfizer's vaccine for children ages 5 to 11. Gottlieb said the Biden administration is making the effort to push the vaccine directly into pediatricians' offices. Pfizer, which Gottlieb sits on the board, is developing a small tray that carries 10 vials at a time and a storage container that is small enough for small to medium-sized pediatrician's office to stock the vaccine and deliver it. Transcript: Dr. Scott Gottlieb on ""Face the Nation"", October 24, 2021 ""It could be stored in a regular refrigerator for up to 10 weeks. It was purposely packaged that way,"" Gottlieb said. ""And so, the idea is to try to get it into pediatrician's offices because we know that getting children vaccinated is a much more consultative endeavor."" Gottlieb said many parents may not want to drag their children into a mass vaccination site or pharmacy and would rather have their children in the comfort of their own pediatrician's office. Dr. Scott Gottlieb on ""Face the Nation"" on October 24, 2021. CBS News Pfizer and BioNTech asked the FDA to authorize the vaccine for children 5 to 11 in early October. On Friday, scientists at the FDA said that the likely benefits of giving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine to 5- to 11-year-olds far outweigh the potential risks, such as heart inflammation. On Tuesday, the FDA's advisory panel will meet to review the data and evidence of the vaccine's safety and effectiveness in children, and vote on whether the FDA should authorize the use. ""If Pfizer does get the authorization on Tuesday from FDA, even before the CDC votes on this on November 2 and 3, they'll start to ship it into the supply chain so it will be available for use once there is a hopefully positive vote from CDC, said Gottlieb. So, it could be as early as November 4 and 5 that you can go into some locations and get your child vaccinated,"" he said. Although kids are at a lower risk of having a severe outcome due to contracting the virus, many have been hospitalized. According to the CDC , at least 731 children have died from COVID-19, including 160 deaths in the 5- to 11-year-old age range. Coronavirus Crisis More Can I get a booster shot?

Africa tries to end vaccine inequity by replicating its own,https://www.burnabynow.com/coronavirus-covid-19-national-news/africa-tries-to-end-vaccine-inequity-by-replicating-its-own-4545421,,,,"CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — In a pair of Cape Town warehouses converted into a maze of airlocked sterile rooms, young scientists are assembling and calibrating the equipment needed to reverse engineer a coronavirus vaccine that has yet to reach So",,2021-10-24 12:23:16,"CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — In a pair of Cape Town warehouses converted into a maze of airlocked sterile rooms, young scientists are assembling and calibrating the equipment needed to reverse engineer a coronavirus vaccine that has yet to reach South Africa and most of the world's poorest people. The energy in the gleaming labs matches the urgency of their mission to narrow vaccine disparities. By working to replicate Moderna's COVID-19 shot, the scientists are effectively making an end run around an industry that has vastly prioritized rich countries over poor in both sales and manufacturing. And they are doing it with unusual backing from the World Health Organization, which is coordinating a vaccine research, training and production hub in South Africa along with a related supply chain for critical raw materials. It's a last-resort effort to make doses for people going without, and the intellectual property implications are still murky. “We are doing this for Africa at this moment, and that drives us,” said Emile Hendricks, a 22-year-old biotechnologist for Afrigen Biologics and Vaccines, the company trying to reproduce the Moderna shot. ""We can no longer rely on these big superpowers to come in and save us.” Some experts see reverse engineering — recreating vaccines from fragments of publicly available information — as one of the few remaining ways to redress the power imbalances of the pandemic . Only 0.7% of vaccines have gone to low-income countries so far, while nearly half have gone to wealthy countries, according to an analysis by the People's Vaccine Alliance. That WHO, which relies upon the goodwill of wealthy countries and the pharmaceutical industry for its continued existence, is leading the attempt to reproduce a proprietary vaccine demonstrates the depths of the supply disparities. The U.N.-backed effort to even out global vaccine distribution, known as COVAX, has failed to alleviate dire shortages in poor countries. Donated doses are coming in at a fraction of what is needed to fill the gap. Meanwhile, pressure for drug companies to share, including Biden administration demands on Moderna, has led nowhere. Until now, WHO has never directly taken part in replicating a novel vaccine for current global use over the objections of the original developers. The Cape Town hub is intended to expand access to the novel messenger RNA technology that Moderna, as well as Pfizer and German partner BioNTech, used in their vaccines. “This is the first time we’re doing it to this level, because of the urgency and also because of the novelty of this technology,” said Martin Friede, a WHO vaccine research coordinator who is helping direct the hub. Dr. Tom Frieden, the former head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has described the world as “being held hostage” by Moderna and Pfizer, whose vaccines are considered the most effective against COVID-19. The novel mRNA process uses the genetic code for the spike protein of the coronavirus and is thought to trigger a better immune response than traditional vaccines. Arguing that American taxpayers largely funded Moderna's vaccine development, the Biden administration has insisted the company must expand production to help supply developing nations. The global shortfall through 2022 is estimated at 500 million and 4 billion doses, depending on how many other vaccines come on the market. “The United States government has played a very substantial role in making Moderna the company it is,” said David Kessler, the head of Operation Warp Speed, the U.S. program to accelerate COVID-19 vaccine development. Kessler would not say how far the administration would go in pressing the company. “They understand what we expect to happen,” he said. Moderna has pledged to build a vaccine factory in Africa at some point in the future. But after pleading with drugmakers to share their recipes, raw materials and technological know-how, some poorer countries are done waiting. Afrigen Managing Director Petro Terblanche said the Cape Town company is aiming to have a version of the Moderna vaccine ready for testing in people within a year and scaled up for commercial production not long after. “We have a lot of competition coming from Big Pharma. They don’t want to see us succeed,"" Terblanche said. ""They are already starting to say that we don’t have the capability to do this. We are going to show them.” If the team in South Africa succeeds in making a version of Moderna’s vaccine, the information will be publicly released for use by others, Terblanche said. Such sharing is closer to an approach U.S. President Joe Biden championed in the spring and the pharmaceutical industry strongly opposes. Commercial production is the point at which intellectual property could become an issue. Moderna has said it would not pursue legal action against a company for infringing on its vaccine rights, but neither has it offered to help companies that have volunteered to make its mRNA shot. Chairman Noubar Afeyan said Moderna determined it would be better to expand production itself than to share technology and plans to deliver billions of additional doses next year. “Within the next six to nine months, the most reliable way to make high-quality vaccines and in an efficient way is going to be if we make them,” Afeyan said. Zoltan Kis, an expert in messenger RNA vaccines at Britain’s University of Sheffield, said reproducing Moderna’s vaccine is “doable” but the task would be far easier if the company shared its expertise. Kis estimated the process involves fewer than a dozen major steps. But certain procedures are tricky, such as sealing the fragile messenger RNA in lipid nanoparticles, he said. “It’s like a very complicated cooking recipe,” he said. “Having the recipe would be very, very helpful, and it would also help if someone could show you how to do it.” A U.N.-backed public health organization still hopes to persuade Moderna that its approach to providing vaccines for poorer countries misses the mark. Formed in 2010, the Medicines Patent Pool initially focused on convincing pharmaceutical companies to share patents for AIDS drugs. “It’s not about outsiders helping Africa,” Executive Director Charles Gore said of the South Africa vaccine hub. “Africa wants to be empowered, and that’s what this is about.” It will eventually fall to Gore to try to resolve the intellectual property question. Work to recreate Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine is protected as research, so a potential dispute would surround steps to sell a replicated version commercially, he said. “It’s about persuading Moderna to work with us rather than using other methods,” Gore said. He said the Medicines Patent Pool repeatedly tried but failed to convince Pfizer and BioNTech to even discuss sharing their formulas. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, who is among the members of Congress backing a bill that calls on the United States to invest more in making and distributing COVID-19 vaccines in low- and middle-income countries, said reverse engineering isn’t going to happen fast enough to keep the virus from mutating and spreading further. “We need to show some hustle. We have to show a sense of urgency, and I’m not seeing that urgency,” he said. “Either we end this pandemic or we muddle our way through.” Campaigners argue the meager amount of vaccines available to poorer countries through donations, COVAX and purchases suggests the Western-dominated pharmaceutical industry is broken. “The enemy to these corporations is losing their potential profit down the line,” Joia Mukherjee, chief medical officer of the global health nonprofit Partners in Health, said. “The enemy isn’t the virus, the enemy isn’t suffering.” Back in Cape Town, the promise of using mRNA technology against other diseases motivates the young scientists. “The excitement is around learning how we harness mRNA technology to develop a COVID-19 vaccine,” Caryn Fenner, Afrigen's technical director, said. But more important, Fenner said, “is not only using the mRNA platform for COVID, but for beyond COVID.” ___ Cheng reported from London; Hinnant reported from Paris.

Comedy comeback: Laughing through COVID-19 with comedian Kate Davis,https://kitchener.citynews.ca/local-news/comedy-comeback-laughing-through-covid-19-with-comedian-kate-davis-4546091,,['Taylor Pace'],,Toronto-based comic Kate Davis will be performing at The Crazy Canuck in Kitchener for Rusty Nail's comedy comeback series on Oct. 29,,2021-10-24 20:30:00,"What happens when a comedian is forced to isolate alone in a room for 21 days? Well, they get a lot of material. Veteran comedian Kate Davis found herself isolated in her room for three weeks, sick with COVID-19 after gigging in BC in March 2020. “But I got some good bits out of it. I say I was 21 days in my bedroom alone. And as a mother of three, I felt like I'd won the lottery. I didn’t have to talk to them or cook or clean,” Davis said. She didn’t have any of the symptoms the doctors told her about. “But the one symptom I had -- I didn't realize I couldn't smell anything, until my teenage son walked in the room, and I couldn't smell him. And I'm like, I’ve got COVID for sure.” Davis has been in the comedy scene since she was 29, before the internet was saturated with comedy shows, she said. “It was in my second or third year of doing comedy that the Comedy Network launched,” she said. “Before, you really had to go to a club to see it.” But she happened to live around the corner from a comedy club, and passed by it regularly. One day she went in to see a show. “And I thought, you know what, I'm gonna give this a try. I think I could do this. And I did and never looked back.” Since then, her career has taken her touring across the country and to Europe. She also does motivational speaking, teaching people how to not take themselves so seriously and incorporate humour into their lives for a “more stress-free and healthier life.” “The most precious thing for me about stand up is it's impossible to laugh and not be in the moment. And we talk about mindfulness all the time. And it's like, the perfect way to be mindful, because you can’t not be when you're laughing. It's the one thing that all humans share -- laughter, no matter what language we're all speaking. So for me, it's just bringing everyone together, being in the moment, sharing in that moment. Davis says she has a lot of new material, much of it derived from her time in isolation. She is currently working on putting out a new EP. Her last album, House Arrest, is available for streaming on all platforms. Davis will be at The Crazy Canuck Oct. 29 for Rusty Nail’s comedy comeback series, along with Vito D'Amico and Dan Brennan. Since August 2020, local entertainment company Rusty Nail has been hosting pro comedy shows every Friday and Saturday night at The Crazy Canuck. They’ve been referring to it as the comedy comeback, because “people really thought that live comedy was dead,” said owner and comedian, Alex (Sandy) MacFarlane. “There was this thought that we’re never coming back; the comedy clubs are all going to close because they won’t be able to financially make it through this time,” he said. “So we wanted to be like, nah, we’re coming back. We’re going to push through all of this.” MacFarlane first got into comedy in 2008 through what he calls a purposeful accident, when a friend encouraged him to try his hand at an amateur night contest at a Yuk Yuks in London, Ont. To his surprise, he ended up winning the competition and was invited back to open for the headliner the following weekend. Being on stage petrified him, but the release of endorphins and adrenaline that hit him after was thrilling, and he became hooked on “the attention and the immediate gratification of a live audience.” “I wasn’t quite the class clown type, but I was always striving to make people laugh, and I had always admired comedians. So I think when I took my shot at it, people were surprised, but not overly surprised,” he said. He started producing shows in 2011, and five years and hundreds of shows later, he launched Rusty Nail. “I did it for two reasons: One, it got me stage time. If I produce the show, I put myself on the show. So it helped me as a comedian that way. But I also was in a pretty serious relationship at that time. And when you're when you're a comic, and you have to travel, especially in a country like Canada. It takes you away from your friends and family quite a bit,” he said. Plus, he loved comedy. So he began producing shows in the region. “It helped that I was a comedian because I knew the right things to do and the right way to treat the comedians,” he said. Throughout the pandemic, Rusty Nail has produced over 100 shows. “I don’t think anybody else in the country could say that,” he said. “At one point, we were the only comedy show in Canada running because we had a special spot downtown Kitchener where we could be outside.” They did a few virtual shows as well between December 2020 and February 2021 when lockdowns were in effect. “Making people laugh during this time was amazing. And at the end of the show, when people are coming up to you saying, that was so funny, I haven’t laughed like that in so long, or I really needed that. It's gold.” For MacFarlane, comedy can be a tool to escape from the craziness of the world. “If it’s COVID, your job, whatever, we’re just here to laugh, forget about that,” he said. “You know, that whole cheesy line about laughter being the best medicine. I really do believe it's true.” You can stay tuned on upcoming shows on their website .",https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/kitchenertoday/images/arts/195299006_493377401965201_13947716168825012_n.jpg;w=630,kitchenertoday

AUSTIN, Oct 25 — Lewis Hamilton had to settle for second but Formula One’s most successful driver said yesterday’s US Grand Prix in Austin still felt like a breakthrough for his sport.The race day crowd of 140,000 at the Circuit of the Americas surpassed the 135,000 who attended the Indianapolis 500 in May, then the largest sporting event in America since the start of the pandemic.The three-day crowd figure for the race in Texas was given as 400,000.“It feels like this is our acceptance into the US,” Hamilton, a five-times winner in Austin, said as he surveyed the scenes after the race.“I hope we get more races out here and I hope that the sport continues to grow because you can tell just how great the fans are out here.”There was no race in Austin last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic but Formula One will have two US rounds next year, with Miami making its debut.There has also been talk of further expansion, with Las Vegas seen as the most likely candidate.While there are no US drivers, the sport has been owned since 2017 by US-based Liberty Media who have targeted America as a key growth area.The sport struggled to make inroads in the past, particularly after an infamous six car race at Indianapolis in 2005 left huge reputational damage.The Texas weekend offered plenty of evidence of Formula One’s growing popularity, with many crediting the Netflix Drive to Survive documentary series, now filming season four.“I think Netflix has been outstanding for Formula One. It’s driven a younger fan base, it’s driven a much larger fan base. It’s really had an impact in America,” said McLaren’s American boss Zak Brown.“I think it’s doing what we as a sport would like it to do, which is turn on a bunch of new fans. I think it’s been hugely successful.”Hamilton’s Mercedes boss Toto Wolff agreed.“We were not keen at the beginning of Netflix because we wanted to concentrate on on-track performance and I was wrong. It’s clearly a big success,” he said.“Everywhere in the world it was the number one documentary on Netflix for quite a while and it’s become part of Formula One and you can clearly see it’s beneficial... the feedback that we get from fans is tremendous, especially here in the US”The attendance may also have been boosted by the lack of a race last year and the pandemic effect, with bottled-up demand for mass gatherings.The tense and thrilling battle between seven-times world champion Hamilton and Red Bull’s Sunday race winner and overall leader Max Verstappen has drawn new fans as well.Mexican Sergio Perez’s move to Red Bull this season as a race winner in a competitive car was another significant factor for fans from the region. — Reuters",2021-10-25 14:38:40,,,malaymail

In 2020 he returned to the show after an absence of four years. Hough announced in 2016 that he would leave the Dancing with the Stars ballroom floor behind. However, he did not leave the world of television behind, appearing as a judge on NBC’s World of Dance.  With great surprise and delight, Hough returned to the series that made him a household name to fill in for head judge Len Goodman. The 2020 season of DWTS filmed under tight coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions. Therefore, Goodman was unable to travel from his London home to the show’s LA location. Just ahead of DWTS’ season 30, Hough revealed he would sit as the fourth judge on the panel. The six-time mirrorball winner’s major announcement Derek Hough | ABC/Adrienne Raquel Hough announced on Instagram, “I’ve really enjoyed being a judge on DWTS, but this Monday, I get from behind the desk and hit the dance floor.” While he did not elaborate further on his performance in this post, fans shared their thrill at the prospect of Hough utilizing his dance talents on the show once again. One of these admirers was fellow judge Inaba who wrote, “It’s about time. I love when you dance, Derek! We all do! I can’t wait to see what magic you are bringing on Monday. And this suit! So good.” Hough’s fans echoed her sentiments. “Derek brightens my Mondays when he dances! I do miss him and his partners competing every week. His creative choreography,  his dancing, and how he brings THE best out of his partners,” wrote one viewer. “Can’t wait to watch!” penned a second follower.

NLC president, Comrade Ayuba Wabba, who stated this yesterday in Abuja, therefore, urged government and other employers of labour to make special arrangements for workers to access the vaccine at their places of work. He said, “I understand some people prefer to view COVID-19 vaccination with caution. Yes, it is important to proceed on issues of public health with great caution. Yet, it would be foolhardy to elevate caution above scientific evidence and facts from public health records. “The truth is that despite being imperfect, the COVID-19 vaccine has given all of us a better chance of fighting the virus and staying alive. I urge workers all over the world to take advantage of the COVID-19 vaccines and keep themselves, their families and their colleagues at work safe and free from the morbid threats of the coronavirus pandemic. “We urge the government and other employers of labour to make special arrangements for workers to access the vaccine at the workplace. “We urge that the tool of persuasion and conviction be used rather than force to get workers and the general populace to take the vaccine.”",,leadership

He is also set to perform on the November 6 episode of ""SNL,"" hosted by Kieran Culkin. It is unclear how his diagnosis will affect that live appearance. Last year, a planned ""SNL' performance by country singer Morgan Wallen was postponed after he was seen just days earlier partying and not practicing social distancing. Last week, Sheeran performed for Prince William and Kate and their guests at the inaugural Earthshot Prize awards . The awards ceremony, hosted by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, rewarded five people trying to save the planet with £1 million, BBC News reports. Along with Sheeran, several other stars were in attendance, including Coldplay, Emma Watson, Emma Thompson and David Oyelowo. The awards ceremony aimed to be environmentally friendly and asked that only guests already in London attend to limit air travel. So, Sheeran has been and will likely remain in London for the time being. The U.K.'s National Health System says those with COVID-19 symptoms should receive a PCR test and those without symptoms can receive a rapid test. In either case, if the test comes back positive, you are meant to self-isolate. There are covid-related travel restrictions in place for those traveling between the U.S. and the U.K. Currently, the CDC classifies the U.K. as a level four – or a country with a very high level of COVID-19. Most British nationals who have been in the U.K., Ireland, the Schengen zone, Iran, Brazil, China, South Africa or India within 14 days are not permitted to enter the U.S., according to the U.K. travel guidance , though there are some exceptions. The U.S. government said it would lift travel restrictions starting on November 8 for foreign citizens who are fully vaccinated.

He focuses on software, fintech, digital health and consumer investments. More posts by this contributor From startups to Starbucks: The embedded API opportunity How retailers can survive the Amazon era The quest to provide more affordable and accessible healthcare, magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic, has spurred an explosion of innovation, which in turn has attracted massive amounts of capital. To put this into perspective, consider this: In 2019, digital health saw $7.7 billion in VC investment, and that number rose to $14.6 billion in 2020. However, the first half of 2021 alone saw $14.7 billion in VC investment. Its marriage with fintech is the catalyst for the transformation of the healthcare industry. Similar to the unbundling of financial services and how fintech is scaling vertical SaaS, the pandemic-fueled disaggregation of healthcare has created new players that are taking a page out of the fintech revolution book — all starting with payments. A growing number of startups are now leveraging the fintech playbook to solve a key part of the healthcare problem — the shifting dynamics between patients, payers and providers, and how payments and related electronic health records (EHRs) flow between them. Not only is the onus of payments and data flow moving from payers to patients, but providers are now facing a monumental shift to new billing and engagement models, requiring new technologies and platforms to help with the change. Through the lens of fintech, here are three key areas to watch in healthcare. Gamifying consumer wellness to stave off chronic illnesses One of the largest trends impacting the population today is the steady rise of chronic illnesses. It is estimated that nearly half the U.S. population will have a chronic illness by 2025. People are getting sicker for longer periods of time, which leads to a constant spending streak. Patients not adhering to medical guidance is a major factor and is responsible for $100 billion of healthcare spending and over 100,000 deaths annually. With around a fifth of patients never filling their prescriptions, it has become a priority to educate and incentivize patients to complete care and avoid readmissions or ER visits. The convergence of health and fintech will be an important catalyst to address some of the most pressing issues facing healthcare today. To curb the rise of chronic illnesses and the associated recurring costs, many startups are using behavioral economics and gamification to incentivize patients and build healthy habits. For example, companies like Paceline in the U.S., Sweatcoin in Europe and Betterfly in Latin America gamify wellness by combining fitness and financial rewards. On the other hand, startups like Sempre Health and Wellth are tackling medical non-adherence with behavioral economics. For example, Wellth financially rewards actions like on-time prescription intake or regular A1c tests for diabetic patients. Fintech for affordability and reducing friction Looking at payers, there’s a major shift stemming from the rise of high-deductible healthcare plans (HDHP) — enrollment has risen 43% in the last five years — emphasizing an increase in premiums and patient financial responsibility. Out-of-pocket expenses threaten the financial stability for many, with 40% of Americans unable to pay an unexpected bill of $400.",2021-10-25 18:15:08,"The quest to provide more affordable and accessible healthcare, magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic, has spurred an explosion of innovation, which in turn has attracted massive amounts of capital.

They claimed: ""My 90-year-old grandparents have been trying to get their booster jabs at but it’s impossible to book one!"" Medics and scientific advisers have accused the government of messing up the booster and school-age vaccine rollout. Because of their failings restrictions could be imposed. According to projections produced by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Covid hospital admissions and deaths over the next year could be halved if 90 per cent of over-50s who become eligible for the booster take it.",,express

(AP) — Sarah Fillier scored twice, including the go-ahead goal with 3:58 remaining, and Canada beat the United States 3-2 in Game 2 of the rivals’ nine-game pre-Olympic series on Monday night. Victoria Bach also scored for Canada, which opened the series with a 3-1 win at Allentown, Pennsylvania, on Friday night. The Canadians, who beat the Americans for the gold medal at the world championships this summer, have now won four straight against the U.S. — their best run since a five-game streak from Dec. 3, 2017 to Feb. 15, 2018. Cayla Barnes had a goal and an assist and Amanda Kessel also scored for the U.S. The game featured a rematch of goaltenders from Canada’s 3-2 overtime win at worlds on Aug. 31. Canada’s Ann-Renee Desbiens stopped 18 shots while USA’s Nicole Hensley stopped 17. The series resumes at Kingston, Ontario, on Nov. 21. American defenseman Megan Keller committed an undisciplined roughing penalty that led to the decisive goal. Keller cross-checked a Canadian player near the benches. Brianne Jenner set up the goal by driving into the right circle and feeding a wide-open Fillier, who swept in the puck at the left post. Though the Americans rebounded from an early 2-0 deficit to tie the game at 2 on Kessel’s goal 5:34 into the second period, they have yet to enjoy a lead over the past two games. The world’s top women’s hockey powers are preparing for the Beijing Winter Games in February, with the Americans attempting to defend their 2018 gold medal. Five of their past eight meetings have been decided by one goal. The Americans vowed to learn from their lapses on Friday, and yet quickly fell into a 2-0 hole 5:03 in, with defensive breakdowns allowing Canada to score on its first two shots on net. Marie-Philip Poulin set up the opening goal 36 seconds in by beating Kelly Pannek off the puck at the right boards. U.S. defenders then backed up, allowing Bach to drive into the slot and lift a shot over Hensley’s glove. A defensive breakdown led to Fillier’s first goal. Canada’s Melodie Daoust outworked Natalie Buchbinder for the puck behind the net and was falling backward while getting a pass off to the left circle, where Natalie Spooner immediately fed a wide-open Fillier, who snapped it into the open right side. The Americans responded with Barnes’ power-play goal with 7:28 left in the first period. Barnes banked in a rising shot from the right point off the far post, with Desbiens screened by Lacey Eden.

Though the actors have played a couple all throughout season two, the new filming experience provided a host of challenges, with its sex scenes becoming a problem in particular. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, Victoria revealed that filming intimate scenes with each other was difficult initially in terms of their safety. “This is not a show where you can be like, ‘nobody’s going to kiss, it’ll be fine’, so it took months to figure out how to do it safely,” she told Entertainment Weekly.  “I felt very lucky that they start off their relationship at odds with each other, navigating the awkwardness of being new parents, because it felt strange to be physically intimate very early on – even though we’re supposed to be a married couple.” Fortunately, Victoria said she and Penn began to feel more comfortable as time went on.  Most read in Showbiz 'eyes opened' Strictly's Giovanni Pernice breaks silence on Maura Higgins split 'SHOCK & HEARTACHE' Alec Baldwin's wife breaks silence days after accidental shooting horror assault Damien Dempsey reveals he feared he'd die after Dublin chip shop attack HAPPY FAMILY Hazel O'Sullivan praises footie partner Andros Townsend for being hands-on-dad INSTA VS REALITY Stacey Solomon reveals secret drama behind picture-perfect Halloween snap GIO ON DATE APP Strictly's Giovanni was secretly on dating app behind Maura Higgins' back “It’s weird.

Penn agreed, adding: “It’s really true, the implications of all that stuff was really felt.” Showrunner Sera Gamble also revealed that they were “really lucky” to be able to do the show the way they wanted. Badgley added: “There were significant rewriters throughout the whole season to try and negotiate around these scenes that would require a lot of people.” The show will also be returning for season four, with die-hard fans desperate to know what will happen to Joe after a shock twist ending. Sera added that Joe has a “hole in his heart” and that fans will have to wait and see what will fix it while exploring his “baggage”.

"Vic has 1510 COVID-19 cases, four deaths",https://www.newcastleherald.com.au/story/7484010/vic-has-1510-covid-19-cases-four-deaths/?src=rss,,['Benita Kolovos'],,,,2021-10-25 22:12:14,"Victoria has recorded 1510 new COVID-19 cases and four deaths as new pandemic laws are set to be introduced to the state's parliament. The health department confirmed on Tuesday the state is managing 24,715 active cases. There are 817 people in hospital, 15 more than the previous day, with the seven-day average at 789. Of those, 147 are in intensive care and 88 on a ventilator. The latest deaths take the toll from the current outbreak to 234. There were 55,679 tests processed and 28,232 COVID-19 vaccine doses administered at state-run hubs on Monday. About 75 per cent of Victorians aged 16 and over are now fully vaccinated. The latest figures come as the state government is set to introduce new laws to parliament that would allow the health minister to make public health orders for the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the changes, Victoria's premier will have the power to ""declare"" a pandemic and extend it in three-month blocks for as long as considered necessary. The Public Health and Wellbeing (Pandemic Management) Bill 2021 will be introduced to the lower house as parliament resumes on Tuesday, several MPs have confirmed to AAP. Under the laws, the health minister will be provided ""broad powers to make pandemic orders"" on the chief health officer's advice, bringing Victoria in line with NSW and New Zealand where the health minister is directly accountable to parliament. An independent oversight committee will review public orders and their impact on human rights, while public health advice will need to be made public. The laws also introduce safeguards around protecting contact tracing and QR code information, while an aggravated offence will be created to ""deter ... the most egregious pandemic-related behaviours"". Court-imposed penalties will be introduced to stop businesses receiving commercial benefit after breaching a pandemic order. The bill aims to improve transparency in pandemic decision-making, with decision-makers to be accountable to parliament and the community, its summary said. It will replace the current state of emergency, which expires on December 15. The government has consulted with community groups, health and human rights experts and legal stakeholders on the proposed laws, and the bill is expected to pass the lower house but in the upper house it will require the backing of three of the 11 crossbenchers. Victoria's opposition said the new powers would give the premier ""more power with less accountability"", as it proposed the constitution be amended to require parliamentary approval for emergency or pandemic declarations. Tuesday's sitting is also the first since a vaccine mandate came into effect banning MPs from parliament if they refuse to provide proof of their vaccination status.

(AP Photo/Anupam Nath) | ASSOCIATED PRESS The mortality caused by a deadly pathogen is partly a reflection of the social and political order it attacks Never in our lifetimes, it seems, has there been greater uncertainty about the future — and greater ignorance of the past. At the beginning of 2020, very few people grasped the significance of the news coming out of Wuhan about a new coronavirus. When I first spoke and wrote publicly about the rising probability of a global pandemic, in the week ending Jan. 26, 2020, I was regarded as eccentric (certainly by the majority of the delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos, who seemed oblivious to the danger). The conventional wisdom at that time, from Fox News to The Washington Post, was that the coronavirus posed a lesser threat to Americans than the usual winter wave of influenza. On Feb. 2, I wrote, “We are now dealing with an epidemic in the world’s most populous country, which has a significant chance of becoming a global pandemic. ... The challenge is ... to resist that strange fatalism that leads most of us not to cancel our travel plans and not to wear uncomfortable masks, even when a dangerous virus is spreading exponentially.” Looking back, I read those sentences as a veiled confession. I was traveling manically in January and February, as I had done for most of the previous 20 years. In January, I flew from London to Dallas, from Dallas to San Francisco, and from there to Hong Kong (Jan. 8), Taipei (Jan. 10), Singapore (Jan. 13), Zurich (Jan. 19), back to San Francisco (Jan. 24), and then to Fort Lauderdale (Jan. 27). I wore a mask once or twice but found it intolerable after an hour and took it off. In the course of February, I flew almost as frequently, though not so far: to New York, Sun Valley, Bozeman, Washington and Lyford Cay in the Bahamas. You may wonder what kind of life that was. I used to joke that the lecture circuit had turned me into an “international man of history.” I realized only later that I might have been one of the “superspreaders” whose hyperactive travel schedules were spreading the virus from Asia to the rest of the world. My weekly newspaper column in the first half of 2020 became a kind of plague diary, though I never mentioned the fact that I was ill for most of February, with a painful cough I could not shake off. (To get through lectures, I relied heavily on the alternative medicine that some call Scotch.) “Worry about grandparents,” I wrote on Feb. 29; “the mortality rate for people in their eighties is above 14%, whereas it’s close to zero for those under 40.” I omitted the less comforting data on asthmatic men in their mid-50s. I also left out the fact that I went to see a doctor twice only to be told that — as more or less everywhere in the United States at that time — there were no tests available for COVID-19. All I knew was that it was serious, and not only for me and my family. As I wrote on March 1: “Those who blithely say, ‘This is no worse than the flu’ ... are missing the point. ... Uncertainty surrounds it because it is so difficult to detect in its early stages, when many carriers are both infectious and asymptomatic. We don’t know for sure how many people have it, so we don’t exactly know its reproduction number and its mortality rate. There’s no vaccine and there’s no cure.” In another article, published in The Wall Street Journal on March 8, I wrote, “If the U.S. turns out to have proportionately as many cases as South Korea, it will soon have some 46,000 cases and more than 300 deaths — or 1,200 deaths if the U.S. mortality rate is as high as Italy’s.” At that point, total confirmed cases in the U.S. stood at just 541; deaths at 22. We passed 46,000 cases on March 24 and 1,200 deaths on March 25, just over two weeks later. On March 15, I noted, “John F. Kennedy airport was thronged yesterday with people doing what, since time immemorial, they have done in times of plague: fleeing the big city (and spreading the virus). ... We are entering the panic phase of the pandemic.” That was the same day I myself flew, with my wife and my two youngest children, from California to Montana. We stayed there for a year. I wrote and thought about little else in the first half of 2020. Why this intense preoccupation? The answer is that, although my core competency is financial history, I have been keenly interested in the role of disease in history ever since studying the Hamburg cholera epidemic of 1892 as a graduate student more than 30 years ago. Richard Evans’ meticulously detailed study of that episode introduced me to the idea that the mortality caused by a deadly pathogen is partly a reflection of the social and political order it attacks. It was the class structure as much as the bacterium Vibrio cholerae that killed people in Hamburg, Germany, Evans argued, because the entrenched power of the city’s property owners had been an insuperable obstacle to improving the city’s antiquated water and sewage systems. The mortality rate for the poor was 13 times higher than for the rich. Researching “The Pity of War” a few years later, I was struck by statistics that suggested the German army had collapsed in 1918 partly because of a surge of illness, possibly resulting from the Spanish influenza pandemic. “The War of the World” (Penguin, 2006) delved more deeply into the history of the 1918-19 pandemic, showing how the First World War ended with twin pandemics — not only influenza but also the ideological contagion of Bolshevism. The work I did on empires in the 2000s also involved excursions into the history of contagious disease. No account of European settlement in the New World could have omitted the role that disease played in “thinning the Indians, to make room for the English,” as John Archdale, the governor of Carolina in the 1690s, callously remarked. (The title of the second chapter of my book “Empire” was “White Plague.”) I was also very struck by the terrible toll of tropical disease on British soldiers stationed far from home: A man’s chances of surviving a tour of duty in Sierra Leone were pitifully low — 1 in 2. “The Great Degeneration” (Penguin, 2014) explicitly warned of our growing vulnerability to “the ... random mutation of viruses like influenza,” while “The Square and the Tower” (Penguin, 2017) was essentially a history of the world based on the insight that “network structures are as important as viruses in determining the speed and extent of a contagion.” The COVID-19 pandemic is far from over. The death toll worldwide approaches five million, which is certainly an underestimate, as the statistics from a number of large countries (notably Iran and Russia) cannot be trusted. And the cumulative body count continues to rise globally — to say nothing of the number of people whose health has been permanently damaged, which no one has yet estimated. It seems increasingly likely that Lord Martin Rees, Britain’s astronomer royal, has won his bet with the Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker that “bioterror or bioerror will lead to one million casualties in a single event within a six month period starting no later than Dec 31 2020.” Some epidemiologists have argued that, without drastic social distancing and economic lockdowns, the ultimate death toll could have been between 30 million and 40 million. Because of government restrictions and changes in public behavior, it will surely not be as high. ASSOCIATED PRESS Cemetery workers lower the coffin of a COVID-19 victim into his grave at the Vila Formosa cemetery in Sao Paulo, Brazil, late Wednesday, March 31, 2021. Because of the increased number of deaths in the city, the burial service in some public cemeteries has been extended to the hours of the night. (AP Photo/Nelson Antoine) Yet precisely these “nonpharmaceutical interventions” have inflicted a shock on the world economy far greater than that caused by the 2008-09 financial crisis — potentially as great as the shock of the Great Depression, but compressed into months, not years. Governments had to take drastic fiscal measures to stave off a collapse of the markets. You see, disasters and their impact are rarely entirely exogenous events, with the exception of a massive meteor strike, which hasn’t happened in 66 million years, or an alien invasion, which hasn’t happened at all. Even a catastrophic earthquake is only as catastrophic as the extent of urbanization along the fault line — or the shoreline, if it triggers a tsunami. A pandemic is made up of a new pathogen and the social networks that it attacks. We cannot understand the scale of the contagion by studying only the virus itself, because the virus will infect only as many people as social networks allow it to. At the same time, a catastrophe lays bare the societies and states that it strikes. It is a moment of truth, of revelation, exposing some as fragile, others as resilient, and others as “antifragile” — able not just to withstand disaster but to be strengthened by it. We still find ourselves in the middle of this pandemic, about which it’s hard to gain the perspective that hindsight affords. But looking at past pandemics and disasters not only helps provide perspective on the current one, but also allow us to understand and prepare for the inevitability of the next one. So cometh now My Lady Influenza, like a star Inebriously wan, and in her train Fever, the haggard soul’s white nenuphur, And lily-fingered Death, and grisly Pain And Constipation who makes all things vain, Pneumonyer, Cancer, and Nasal Catarrh. Rupert Brooke’s “To My Lady Influenza” (1906) was a facetious undergraduate work. Yet “Lady Influenza” was never to be trifled with. The first well-described influenza outbreaks were in 16th-century Europe, but the earliest was probably in 1173. There had been significant influenza pandemics in the 18th and 19th centuries, but the 20th century was to be hit much harder. A more populous world was also a more urban world and a more mobile world — a world in which low air quality in industrial towns may have made people more susceptible to respiratory illnesses. A year after Brooke wrote “To My Lady Influenza,” his eldest brother, Dick, died of pneumonia at the age of 26. Brooke himself would live only a year longer, dying of an infected mosquito bite that led to sepsis, off the Greek island of Skyros. A predictable “gray rhino,” in the sense that danger of a general European war was well known, but also a surprising “black swan,” in the sense that contemporaries seemed bewildered by its outbreak, the First World War was a true dragon-king event in terms of its vast historical consequences. As disastrous as the war was, its proximate impact in terms of lives lost was exceeded by that of the influenza pandemic that broke out in its final year. Where exactly the new strain of H1N1 first appeared is uncertain, but it is usually said to have been Fort Riley, Kansas, the site of Camp Funston, one of the network of Army camps where hundreds of thousands of young American men were being trained to fight in Europe as the American Expeditionary Forces. There is, however, evidence that the pandemic originated in the British Army in 1917, though the condition was initially identified as “purulent bronchitis with bronchopneumonia.” Here was the key to influenza’s 20th-century success. Never had armies been mobilized on such a scale before — more than 70 million men in uniform. Never had so many young men been taken from their homes and workplaces, crowded into primitive accommodations, and sent over long distances in ships and trains. The idea that the virus originated in pigs has been refuted (an avian origin seems more likely); if anything, the direction of infection was from men to pigs. The first American cases were recorded at Camp Funston on March 4. A week later, a member of Fort Riley’s catering staff entered the infirmary, followed in the coming days by a stream of infected soldiers. By the end of the month, more than a thousand cases had been recorded and 48 men had died of influenza. As if to mock the efforts of men to kill one another, the virus spread rapidly across the United States and then crossed to Europe on the jam-packed American troopships. It is possible that the pandemic explains the near doubling of the proportion of German soldiers reporting sick in the summer of 1918, which was a crucial factor in the imperial army’s subsequent collapse. Certainly, we have reports of German prisoners of war with the flu from July. By that time it had reached India, Australia and New Zealand. A few months later, a second and deadlier wave struck all but simultaneously in Brest, France; Freetown, Sierra Leone; and Boston. The virus made a new landfall in the United States at Boston’s Commonwealth Pier on Aug. 27, 1918, when three cases of influenza appeared on the sick list. Eight cases emerged the next day, and 58 the next, 15 of whom were so ill they were transferred to the U.S. Naval Hospital in Chelsea. On Sept. 8, influenza arrived at the Army’s Camp Devens. Within 10 days, thousands of feverish patients overwhelmed the camp’s hospitals; within weeks, the morgue was full of blue-tinged, asphyxiated corpses. Combatant countries sought to suppress the news of the pandemic as potentially harmful to wartime morale; this hardly helped to keep the public informed. The disease came to be known as the Spanish flu because only the largely uncensored press of neutral Spain reported on it with any accuracy. Between 40 million and 50 million people died as a result of the pandemic, the majority of them suffocated by a lethal accumulation of blood and other fluid in the lungs. The absolute numbers were highest in India (18.5 million deaths) and China (between 4 million and 9.5 million), but death rates varied widely from place to place. Close to half (44.5%) of the population of Cameroon was wiped out; in Western Samoa, nearly a quarter (23.6%). The worst mortality rates in Europe were in Hungary and Spain (each around 1.2%), with Italy not far behind. By contrast, North America got off lightly: between 0.53% and 0.65% for the United States, 0.61% for Canada. As these figures imply, the Spanish flu was indifferent as to a country’s combatant status. While its initial spread may have been related to wartime accommodation and transportation, that soon ceased to be true. In the United States, the deaths of as many as 675,000 people were attributed to the Spanish flu, of which 550,000 were excess deaths (above what would have been expected in that period under normal circumstances). Equivalent mortality in 2020 would have been between 1.8 million and 2.2 million Americans. The Spanish flu killed an order of magnitude more Americans than died in combat in the war (53,402). Ironically, unlike most flu epidemics, but like the war that preceded and spread it, the influenza of 1918 disproportionately killed young adults. Out of 272,500 male influenza deaths in the United States, nearly 49% were aged 20 to 39, whereas only 18% were under five and 13% were over 50. The very young and very old were also (as usual) vulnerable, so that all countries for which age-specific death rates are available recorded a roughly W-shaped age distribution of mortality. Death was not caused by the influenza virus itself so much as by the body’s immunological reaction to the virus. Perversely, this meant that individuals with the strongest immune systems were more likely to die than those with weaker immune systems. A good illustration of the impact of the pandemic on young adults, as well as a vivid description of the hallucinogenic miseries of the illness itself, can be found in Katherine Anne Porter’s short story “Pale Horse, Pale Rider” (1937), about a wartime romance cut cruelly short by the virus. In Sept. 2021, COVID-19’s American death toll overtook that of the 1918 flu. And yet, in Aug. 2020, it appeared that, with a regime of mass testing, contact tracing, social distancing and targeted quarantining, a country could contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2, as the virus relied heavily on superspreaders for its transmission and disproportionately sickened or killed people past retirement age. Only in the spring of 2021 did it join the elite of pandemics — the 20 or so in recorded history that killed upward of 0.05% of humanity. Only a handful of those nations that fought World War II have lost more people per day to COVID-19 than they have lost to the Axis powers. The United States is one of those countries. This illustrates something profound — that all disasters are at some level man-made political disasters, even if they originate with new pathogens. Politics explained why World War II killed 25 times as many Germans as Americans. Politics also helps to explain why COVID-19 has thus far killed more than eight times as many Americans as Germans.

Coronavirus cases in India are surging faster than anywhere else in the world. (AP Photo/Anupam Nath) This plague began as a gray rhino, predicted by many. It struck as a black swan, somehow completely unforeseen. Could it become a world-changing “dragon king”? As we have seen, disasters of any kind become truly epoch-making events only if their economic, social and political ramifications amount to more than the excess mortality they cause. Could this medium-size disaster nevertheless alter our lives permanently and profoundly? Let me now hazard three guesses. First, COVID-19 will be to social life what AIDS was to sexual life: It will change our behavior, though by no means enough to avert a significant number of premature deaths. I myself welcome a new age of social distancing, but then I am a natural misanthrope who hates crowds and will not greatly miss hugs and handshakes. Most people, however, will be unable to resist the temptations of post-lockdown gregariousness. There will be unsafe socializing just as there still is unsafe sex, even after more than three decades and 30 million deaths from HIV. Second, and for that reason, most big cities are not “over.” Do we all now head from Gotham or the Great Wen to the villages, there to cultivate our vegetable gardens in splendid, rustic isolation? Do nearly half of us continue to work from home, as we did during the pandemic — more than three times more than before? Probably not. It takes a lot to kill a city. True, just over a century after Thomas Mann wrote “Death in Venice” (1912), Venice is pretty much dead. But it was not cholera that killed it — it was the shifting pattern of international trade. Likewise, COVID-19 will not kill London or New York; it will just make them cheaper, grungier and younger. Some billionaires will not return. Some firms and many families will move to the suburbs or even farther afield. Tax revenues will drop. Crime rates will jump. As Gerald Ford supposedly did in 1975, when the city asked for a federal bailout, another president may tell New York to “drop dead.” San Francisco will lose talent to Austin. But inertia is a powerful thing. Americans these days relocate less than they used to. Only a third of jobs can really be done at home; everyone else will still need to work in offices, shops and factories. Workplaces will just be different — more spacious and campus-like, as they already are in Silicon Valley. Commuting will no longer involve being packed like sardines on a subway. No more unwelcome intimacies on elevators. Masks over most faces. No more tut-tutting at the hijab and the niqab. Perforce, we are all modest now. What of the pandemic’s impact on the generational imbalances that had grown so intolerable in many societies by 2020? Was COVID-19 sent by Freya, the goddess of youth, to emancipate millennials and Generation Z from bearing the fiscal burden of an excessive number of elderly people? It is tempting to marvel at this ageist virus. No previous pandemic was so discriminating against the elderly and in favor of the young. But in truth, the impact of COVID-19 in terms of excess mortality will probably not be great enough to balance the intergenerational accounts. In the short run, the majority of old people will remain retired; relatively few will die prematurely — hardly any in the most elderly of countries, Japan. The young, meanwhile, will be the ones struggling to find jobs (other than with Amazon) and struggling almost as much to have fun. An economy without crowds is not a “new normal.” It may be more like the new anomie, to borrow Émile Durkheim’s term for the sense of disconnectedness he associated with modernity. For most young people, the word “fun” is almost synonymous with “crowd.” The era of distancing will be a time of depression in the psychological as well as the economic sense. The gloom has been especially deep for Generation Z, whose university social lives — half the point of college, if not more — were wrecked. They spent yet more time on electronic devices — perhaps an hour a day more than before the pandemic. It did not make them happier. History tells us to expect the great punctuation marks of disaster in no predictable order. The four horsemen of the Book of Revelation — Conquest, War, Famine and the pale rider Death — gallop out at seemingly random intervals to remind us that no amount of technological innovation can make mankind invulnerable. Indeed, some innovations — like those fleets of jet airplanes that transported so many infected people from Wuhan to the rest of the world in Jan. 2020 — give the horsemen the opportunity to ride in their slipstream. Yet somehow the riders’ arrival always takes us by surprise. For a moment, we contemplate the scenario of total extinction. We shelter in place, watching “Contagion” or reading Atwood. Perhaps the black swan becomes a dragon king and turns life upside down. But very rarely. Mostly, for the lucky many, life after the disaster goes on, changed in a few ways but on the whole remarkably, reassuringly, boringly the same. With astonishing speed, we put our brush with mortality behind us and blithely carry on, forgetful of those who were not so lucky, regardless of the next disaster that lies in wait. Think, if you doubt the truth of this, of Daniel Defoe’s concluding doggerel from his “Journal of the Plague Year”: A dreadful Plague in London was, In the Year Sixty Five, Which swept an Hundred Thousand Souls Away; yet I alive!

At the beginning of 2020, very few people grasped the significance of the news coming out of Wuhan about a new coronavirus. When I first spoke and wrote publicly about the rising probability of a global pandemic, in the week ending Jan. 26, 2020, I was regarded as eccentric (certainly by the majority of the delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos, who seemed oblivious to the danger). The conventional wisdom at that time, from Fox News to The Washington Post, was that the coronavirus posed a lesser threat to Americans than the usual winter wave of influenza. On Feb. 2, I wrote, “We are now dealing with an epidemic in the world’s most populous country, which has a significant chance of becoming a global pandemic. ... The challenge is ... to resist that strange fatalism that leads most of us not to cancel our travel plans and not to wear uncomfortable masks, even when a dangerous virus is spreading exponentially.” Looking back, I read those sentences as a veiled confession. Related Is there hope for the family after the pandemic? Or will the battle of the sexes rage on? The river is round I was traveling manically in January and February, as I had done for most of the previous 20 years. In January, I flew from London to Dallas, from Dallas to San Francisco, and from there to Hong Kong (Jan. 8), Taipei (Jan. 10), Singapore (Jan. 13), Zurich (Jan. 19), back to San Francisco (Jan. 24), and then to Fort Lauderdale (Jan. 27). I wore a mask once or twice but found it intolerable after an hour and took it off. In the course of February, I flew almost as frequently, though not so far: to New York, Sun Valley, Bozeman, Washington and Lyford Cay in the Bahamas. You may wonder what kind of life that was. I used to joke that the lecture circuit had turned me into an “international man of history.” I realized only later that I might have been one of the “superspreaders” whose hyperactive travel schedules were spreading the virus from Asia to the rest of the world. My weekly newspaper column in the first half of 2020 became a kind of plague diary, though I never mentioned the fact that I was ill for most of February, with a painful cough I could not shake off. (To get through lectures, I relied heavily on the alternative medicine that some call Scotch.) “Worry about grandparents,” I wrote on Feb. 29; “the mortality rate for people in their eighties is above 14%, whereas it’s close to zero for those under 40.” I omitted the less comforting data on asthmatic men in their mid-50s. I also left out the fact that I went to see a doctor twice only to be told that — as more or less everywhere in the United States at that time — there were no tests available for COVID-19. All I knew was that it was serious, and not only for me and my family. As I wrote on March 1: “Those who blithely say, ‘This is no worse than the flu’ ... are missing the point. ... Uncertainty surrounds it because it is so difficult to detect in its early stages, when many carriers are both infectious and asymptomatic. We don’t know for sure how many people have it, so we don’t exactly know its reproduction number and its mortality rate. There’s no vaccine and there’s no cure.” In another article, published in The Wall Street Journal on March 8, I wrote, “If the U.S. turns out to have proportionately as many cases as South Korea, it will soon have some 46,000 cases and more than 300 deaths — or 1,200 deaths if the U.S. mortality rate is as high as Italy’s.” At that point, total confirmed cases in the U.S. stood at just 541; deaths at 22. We passed 46,000 cases on March 24 and 1,200 deaths on March 25, just over two weeks later. On March 15, I noted, “John F. Kennedy airport was thronged yesterday with people doing what, since time immemorial, they have done in times of plague: fleeing the big city (and spreading the virus). ... We are entering the panic phase of the pandemic.” That was the same day I myself flew, with my wife and my two youngest children, from California to Montana. We stayed there for a year. I wrote and thought about little else in the first half of 2020. Why this intense preoccupation? The answer is that, although my core competency is financial history, I have been keenly interested in the role of disease in history ever since studying the Hamburg cholera epidemic of 1892 as a graduate student more than 30 years ago. Richard Evans’ meticulously detailed study of that episode introduced me to the idea that the mortality caused by a deadly pathogen is partly a reflection of the social and political order it attacks. It was the class structure as much as the bacterium Vibrio cholerae that killed people in Hamburg, Germany, Evans argued, because the entrenched power of the city’s property owners had been an insuperable obstacle to improving the city’s antiquated water and sewage systems. The mortality rate for the poor was 13 times higher than for the rich. Researching “The Pity of War” a few years later, I was struck by statistics that suggested the German army had collapsed in 1918 partly because of a surge of illness, possibly resulting from the Spanish influenza pandemic. “The War of the World” (Penguin, 2006) delved more deeply into the history of the 1918-19 pandemic, showing how the First World War ended with twin pandemics — not only influenza but also the ideological contagion of Bolshevism. The work I did on empires in the 2000s also involved excursions into the history of contagious disease. No account of European settlement in the New World could have omitted the role that disease played in “thinning the Indians , to make room for the English , ” as John Archdale, the governor of Carolina in the 1690s, callously remarked. (The title of the second chapter of my book “Empire” was “White Plague.”) I was also very struck by the terrible toll of tropical disease on British soldiers stationed far from home: A man’s chances of surviving a tour of duty in Sierra Leone were pitifully low — 1 in 2. “ The Great Degeneration” (Penguin, 2014) explicitly warned of our growing vulnerability to “the ... random mutation of viruses like influenza,” while “The Square and the Tower” (Penguin, 2017) was essentially a history of the world based on the insight that “network structures are as important as viruses in determining the speed and extent of a contagion.” The COVID-19 pandemic is far from over. The death toll worldwide approaches five million, which is certainly an underestimate, as the statistics from a number of large countries (notably Iran and Russia) cannot be trusted. And the cumulative body count continues to rise globally — to say nothing of the number of people whose health has been permanently damaged, which no one has yet estimated. It seems increasingly likely that Lord Martin Rees, Britain’s astronomer royal, has won his bet with the Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker that “bioterror or bioerror will lead to one million casualties in a single event within a six month period starting no later than Dec 31 2020.” Some epidemiologists have argued that, without drastic social distancing and economic lockdowns, the ultimate death toll could have been between 30 million and 40 million. Because of government restrictions and changes in public behavior, it will surely not be as high. Cemetery workers lower the coffin of a COVID-19 victim into his grave at the Vila Formosa cemetery in Sao Paulo, Brazil, late Wednesday, March 31, 2021. Because of the increased number of deaths in the city, the burial service in some public cemeteries has been extended to the hours of the night. (AP Photo/Nelson Antoine) ASSOCIATED PRESS Yet precisely these “nonpharmaceutical interventions” have inflicted a shock on the world economy far greater than that caused by the 2008-09 financial crisis — potentially as great as the shock of the Great Depression, but compressed into months, not years. Governments had to take drastic fiscal measures to stave off a collapse of the markets. You see, disasters and their impact are rarely entirely exogenous events, with the exception of a massive meteor strike, which hasn’t happened in 66 million years, or an alien invasion, which hasn’t happened at all. Even a catastrophic earthquake is only as catastrophic as the extent of urbanization along the fault line — or the shoreline, if it triggers a tsunami. A pandemic is made up of a new pathogen and the social networks that it attacks. We cannot understand the scale of the contagion by studying only the virus itself, because the virus will infect only as many people as social networks allow it to. At the same time, a catastrophe lays bare the societies and states that it strikes. It is a moment of truth, of revelation, exposing some as fragile, others as resilient, and others as “antifragile” — able not just to withstand disaster but to be strengthened by it. We still find ourselves in the middle of this pandemic, about which it’s hard to gain the perspective that hindsight affords. But looking at past pandemics and disasters not only helps provide perspective on the current one, but also allow us to understand and prepare for the inevitability of the next one. So cometh now My Lady Influenza, like a star Inebriously wan, and in her train Fever, the haggard soul’s white nenuphur, And lily-fingered Death, and grisly Pain And Constipation who makes all things vain, Pneumonyer, Cancer, and Nasal Catarrh. Rupert Brooke’s “To My Lady Influenza” (1906) was a facetious undergraduate work. Yet “Lady Influenza” was never to be trifled with. The first well-described influenza outbreaks were in 16th-century Europe, but the earliest was probably in 1173. There had been significant influenza pandemics in the 18th and 19th centuries, but the 20th century was to be hit much harder. A more populous world was also a more urban world and a more mobile world — a world in which low air quality in industrial towns may have made people more susceptible to respiratory illnesses. A year after Brooke wrote “To My Lady Influenza,” his eldest brother, Dick, died of pneumonia at the age of 26. Brooke himself would live only a year longer, dying of an infected mosquito bite that led to sepsis, off the Greek island of Skyros. A predictable “gray rhino,” in the sense that danger of a general European war was well known, but also a surprising “black swan,” in the sense that contemporaries seemed bewildered by its outbreak, the First World War was a true dragon-king event in terms of its vast historical consequences. As disastrous as the war was, its proximate impact in terms of lives lost was exceeded by that of the influenza pandemic that broke out in its final year. Where exactly the new strain of H1N1 first appeared is uncertain, but it is usually said to have been Fort Riley, Kansas, the site of Camp Funston, one of the network of Army camps where hundreds of thousands of young American men were being trained to fight in Europe as the American Expeditionary Forces. There is, however, evidence that the pandemic originated in the British Army in 1917, though the condition was initially identified as “purulent bronchitis with bronchopneumonia.” Here was the key to influenza’s 20th-century success. Never had armies been mobilized on such a scale before — more than 70 million men in uniform. Never had so many young men been taken from their homes and workplaces, crowded into primitive accommodations, and sent over long distances in ships and trains. The idea that the virus originated in pigs has been refuted (an avian origin seems more likely); if anything, the direction of infection was from men to pigs. The first American cases were recorded at Camp Funston on March 4. A week later, a member of Fort Riley’s catering staff entered the infirmary, followed in the coming days by a stream of infected soldiers. By the end of the month, more than a thousand cases had been recorded and 48 men had died of influenza.

TUARAN, Oct 24 — The Sabah government hopes that its needs and claims in the Malaysia Agreement 1963 (MA63) be considered when tabling the bill in Parliament tomorrow to amend the Federal Constitution so as to be in line with this agreement.Chief Minister Datuk Hajiji Noor said the Sabah government had given its views on the state’s position and claims in line with MA63 at the special meeting held on October 18, so he hoped these could be realised.“We had the MA63 Special Meeting chaired by the Prime Minister (Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob) last week and several proposals in amending the constitution were made.“I have been informed that Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department (Parliament and Law), Datuk Seri Wan Junaidi Tuanku Jaafar would be tabling the bill.“The Sarawak government has also given its views on MA63. So, our hope is for our needs and claims be considered in amending the constitution at the next parliamentary sitting which will start tomorrow,” he told reporters, here, today.He was asked to comment on Wan Junaidi’s statement that the government would continue with its plan to table the bill in Parliament next Tuesday for the amendments to be in line with MA63.However, Wan Junaidi said in the statement yesterday that the second reading of the bill would be rescheduled to another date from the earlier planned date of October 28 to enable the Attorney-General to explain further the proposed amendments to members of the Cabinet.Earlier, Hajiji officiated at the state-level Urban Poor Career Carnival organised by the Sabah Social Security Organisation (Socso), offering over 1,000 job vacancies with15 employers participating in the job interview programme held in conjunction with the carnival.He said this effort could help the vulnerable urban residents and B40 group including school leavers, graduates and those who had lost their jobs to find employment.“Cooperation between the state government and Sabah Socso has also managed to find employment for 4,864 individuals in the first nine months of this year, hence helping to reduce the unemployment rate.“This is a very good move in the country’s process of reviving and invigorating the economy,” he said, adding that Sabah Socso had organised 307 interview sessions with the cooperation of various industries and employers during the Covid-19 pandemic.In line with the Sabah Maju Jaya Direction, Sabah Socso had also established strategic collaboration with the state government to help stabilise and manage the labour market through continuous employment service activities, he said. — Bernama",2021-10-24 09:37:45,,,malaymail

COVID-19's route from pandemic to endemic,https://www.newcastleherald.com.au/story/7479895/covid-19s-route-from-pandemic-to-endemic/?src=rss,,['Damon Cronshaw'],,"For a virus to become truly endemic, infection starts at birth.",,2021-10-24 08:00:00,"Newcastle-based viral immunologist Nathan Bartlett says there is a long way to go before the COVID-19 pandemic shifts to an endemic. ""We're still very much trying to understand how this virus will behave in the long term,"" said Associate Professor Bartlett , of HMRI and the University of Newcastle. ""At the moment we're still in a game of tug-of-war with this virus, as we work towards a high level of sustained immunity in the population."" He said it may take several years for immunity to ""slowly but surely be established and maintained"". ""If or when it becomes an endemic virus is still very unclear."" He said the push for immunity in the population was essentially a war with the virus, amid battles for the number of cases and severe disease to slowly fall. ""You eventually get to an equilibrium where COVID-19 would almost always be a mild infection, where everyone has some level of immunity and it's more like the flu by that stage. ""We're still a long way from there, unfortunately. There's a long way to go."" Dr Bartlett said an endemic meant ""a relatively predictable level of infection within a given geographical area"". For example, we know when flu season peaks. ""Some seasons are worse than others, depending on how the virus changes. But we all have some level of persistent immunity to flu, which is boosted by the flu vaccine."" The flu vaccine is updated annually to give the best possible protection, which is a particularly important measure for the elderly and those with chronic diseases. There were many endemic respiratory viruses - including the other coronaviruses - that ""we all get infected with early in life and repeatedly throughout life"". For a virus to become truly endemic, infection starts at birth. ""All respiratory viruses infect people as infants and children. They get lots of infections, but children's immune systems are such that they don't usually get seriously ill with these respiratory viruses. COVID is a great example of that. ""Kids get lots of respiratory viruses, but they won't get super ill except in very rare cases - a lot less rarely than older adults, certainly."" When children get infected with endemic viruses, the immune system ""establishes a level of baseline immunity"". ""Of course, that doesn't happen when a new virus introduces itself into a population. The majority of the population are adults. ""And so now you have an adult immune system faced with a new virus. That's a very different equation in terms of the sort of disease profile that carries. ""This is why the elderly and even middle-aged adults are very vulnerable to COVID."" Nevertheless, he said COVID can cause serious illness and death in some younger people ""because we haven't established any level of immunity from birth because the virus wasn't endemic"". ""If this virus is still circulating for years to come, babies will be exposed to it from birth and carry that immune protection into adulthood and indeed it will be a true endemic virus. ""It won't kill you, you'll probably get infected multiple times as a child and develop a level of immunity. So when you do reach adulthood, it's not going to whack you around as much."" Globally, governments have managed the pandemic as a balance between protecting people from the virus and protecting economies, amid struggles between individual rights and the common good. Asked if he thought we'd been too accepting in NSW of harsh restrictions, Dr Bartlett said: ""We had no choice"". ""We had a window of opportunity in early 2021 to get everyone vaccinated before winter. Obviously that didn't happen."" As Delta spread in Sydney and elsewhere, NSW cities and regions entered various levels of lockdown. ""It really couldn't go any other way because how else could you protect everyone until there was a high level of vaccine-induced immune protection?"" And while COVID posed a serious public health risk, lockdown came with rises in unemployment and isolation that also posed health risks. The questions for governments became about how much risk should be taken. ""Risk equations can go on and on. I totally get the frustration around this,"" Dr Bartlett said. ""But it is largely counterproductive and doesn't get you anywhere because the risk moves as the virus and levels of infection change. We can have an outbreak and you're in a whole different scenario."" IN THE NEWS: Our journalists work hard to provide local, up-to-date news to the community.

While many parents were overjoyed at the news that Health Canada is considering approval of the first COVID-19 vaccine for kids age five to 11 in Canada, parents like Hubert are feeling more trepidatious, and public health officials said they are going to have a much more nuanced conversation with parents about vaccination than they did with adults. While 82 per cent of eligible Canadians aged 12 and up are already fully vaccinated, a recent survey by Angus Reid shows only 51 per cent of parents plan to immediately vaccinate their kids when a pediatric dose becomes available. Of parents with children in the five to 11 year age range, 23 per cent said they would never give their kids a COVID-19 vaccine, 18 per cent said they would wait, and nine per cent said they weren’t sure, according to the survey of 5,011 Canadians between Sept. 29 and Oct. 3, which cannot be assigned a margin of error because online surveys are not considered random samples. “Most of the research that I've seen sort of indicates that parents are more hesitant to vaccinate their kids against COVID than themselves,” said Kate Allen, a post-doctoral fellow at the Center for Vaccine Preventable Diseases of the University of Toronto. There are several reasons parents might pause, she said. It’s true that children are at a much lower risk of serious outcomes associated with COVID-19, and there have been very rare incidents of mRNA vaccines like Pfizer or Moderna linked to cases of myocarditis, a swelling of the heart muscle. As of Oct. 1, Health Canada has documented 859 cases associated with the vaccines, which mainly seem to affect people under 40 years old, and people who’ve developed the complication have typically been fine. “I know it's rare, I know it's not deadly, but I also see the risk of severe symptoms from COVID as being rare and not deadly for Jackson,” Hubert said when asked about weighing up the risks and benefits of the vaccine. But public health experts stress that some children do suffer from rare but serious impacts from COVID-19, which can also cause myocarditis as well as the little-understood impacts of the condition known as long COVID. They say parents should consider the less tangible benefits of vaccination as well. “It's less of a conversation about a direct benefit to them, and more of a community benefit,” Allen said. The pandemic has taken a heavy toll on children, depriving them of school, time with their peers, extracurriculars — and their mental health has suffered as a result, said Dr. Vinita Dubey, associate medical officer of health with Toronto Public Health. “Not one child has been spared from this pandemic. I mean every single child has had to bear a sacrifice because of the pandemic in one way or the other,” Dubey said. So far Pfizer-BioNtech is the only manufacturer to request approval for its pediatric COVID-19 vaccine and Health Canada is still reviewing the data. The regulator has promised the review will be thorough, and the vaccine will only be approved for children if the benefits outweigh the potential risks. Policy-makers know they’re going to have to take parents' concerns seriously as well. On a recent tour of the Childrens’ Hospital of Eastern Ontario in Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with Dr. Anne Pham-Huy, a pediatric infectious diseases physician. “Vaccine confidence is going to be the most important part of it this time around,” Pham-Huy said, to which Trudeau agreed. Dubey has published research on improving parents’ vaccine confidence when it comes to long-established inoculations like mumps and rubella. While she offered several tips, they mainly come down to building trust. Her research focused on the role of family doctors, but she said during the pandemic anyone can be that trusted sounding board. “It could be a faith leader, it could be an important family member or friend, someone who you trust, to help guide you to the right sources to make that decision,” she said. With that in mind, several students from across North America launched a peer-to-peer education program called Students for Herd Immunity to allow kids to have those conversations among themselves. The public health experts agree, the debate around vaccines has become polarized and open conversations will be the key to addressing parents' concerns. “I think one thing to say to parents is you don't have to make your decision right away,” Dubey said. “I mean for those who are ready to make their decision, but it's fine but if you have questions, seek the answers.” Her only advice is to get those answers from a trusted source, and not social media.

MIRI, Oct 25 — A Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR) member said there could be a three- or even five-cornered fight for the Marudi state seat currently held by Assistant Minister of Local Government and Housing Datu Dr Penguang Manggil in the next state election.PKR Marudi chairman Elias Lipi Mat, himself a potential candidate for the seat, said apart from his party, the other likely contenders would be Progressive Democratic Party (PDP) representing the current ruling coalition Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS), and Parti Sarawak Bersatu (PSB) who is said to be fielding former assemblyman Datuk Sylvester Entri Muran.“There are also rumours about PBK (Parti Bumi Kenyalang) and Bersatu (Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia) having their respective candidates for Marudi,” he said.“With good planning, I believe that PKR has a good election manifesto.“We have many local issues and agenda that should draw the attention of the voters in Marudi, one of which is the basic infrastructure such as clean water and electricity supply, as well as roads — all of which have yet to be addressed properly over the years.“Such matters may look petty to others, but they are very close to the people, especially those living in the rural and remote areas,” said Elias in a statement.Moreover, he said the Marudi sub-branch of the PKR would be all ready for the 12th state election, despite them not agreeing to the polls being called amidst the current Covid-19 situation.He said his election machinery would kick off once the Sarawak State Legislative Assembly (DUN) had been dissolved.“Nevertheless, we do admit that the state election this time would be very challenging, in view of the Covid-19 pandemic,” he said.In the 11th state election in 2016, Penguang won the seat after garnering 5,493 votes, which earned him the majority of 1,387. — Borneo Post",2021-10-25 01:22:56,,,malaymail

It is the second COVID-19 booster vaccine to be approved in the EU. “This follows data showing that a third dose of Spikevax given 6 to 8 months after the second dose led to a rise in antibody levels in adults whose antibody levels were waning,” the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said. Earlier this month, the EMA approved Pfizer-BioNTech’s booster and recommended a third dose of a shot from either Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna for people with weakened immune systems. It left EU member states to decide if the wider population should receive a booster. EMA on Monday said that the implementation of vaccination campaigns remains the prerogative of the advisory groups guiding the vaccination campaigns in each EU Member State. Under pressure to revive their economies, fight the more infectious Delta variant of the coronavirus and avoid further lockdowns in the winter, several EU member states launched their own booster campaigns before EMA guidelines. The different states have taken widely varying views on who is eligible. The EMA said the risk of inflammatory heart conditions or other very rare side effects after a booster is being monitored. U.S. authorities have authorized booster doses of Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson.

KUCHING, Oct 26 ― Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture Datuk Seri Abdul Karim Rahman Hamzah calls for no open campaign and no open rally to facilitate the next Sarawak election.“No open campaigning or no open rally does not mean that democracy is curtailed,” the Parti Pesaka Bumiputera Bersatu (PBB) vice president said.Abdul Karim pointed out that there are other ways and means candidates in election can promote themselves, especially in this digital era.“We have seen what had happened in Sabah after they held their snap state election (in September 2020),” said the Asajaya assemblyman.“In view of Sarawak having to undergo a state election soon, it is advisable for the Election Commission (or SPR) to find ways to make sure that the ‘mistakes’ made during last Sabah state election are not repeated,” he added.Abdul Karim was reacting to the latest comment by Minister of Health Khairy Jamaluddin that no election-related social gatherings or activities are allowed to facilitate the coming Melaka snap state election in order to reduce Covid-19 infection among people there.Khairy said the order is to take effect yesterday (October 25) until November 27, 2021.When contacted yesterday, Parti Rakyat Sarawak (PRS) secretary-general Dato Janang Bungsu said he agreed with Khairy.“Agree that it should be within the stipulated standard operating procedures (SOPs). After all, we are yet to come out from Covid-19 problem. Stringent SOPs must be observed to minimise physical contact,” added Janang.Progressive Democratic Party (PDP) vice president Datu Dr Penguang Manggil however said it would still be premature now to talk about SOPs for Sarawak election which is being stalled as the state is under the Emergency Order (EO) until its expiry on February 1, 2022.“The SOPs mentioned therein are for Melaka, during this given time and circumstances. It may be relevant to be imposed in Melaka but may or may not be necessary for Sarawak,” said the Assistant Minister of Housing and Local Government.“It is also too premature to talk about the SOPs as we have to know when the Emergency is to be lifted and the State Legislative Assembly (DUN) is to be dissolved.“I am pretty confident that the Ministry of Health (MoH), State Health Department, the SPR and the Sarawak Disaster Management Committee will be duly consulted and SOP formulated, taking all factors and any emerging issues before the decision to call for the PRN12 (12th Sarawak election) is made,” said Penguang, who is also Marudi assemblyman.Khairy had said in a media statement on October 24: “Based on the monitoring by the Ministry of Health, among the contributors to the increase in cases and Covid-19 clusters in the country were related to the activities of gatherings or social gatherings that did not comply with the standard operating procedures (SOPs).”The MoH expected that similar activities will take place leading up to the Melaka state election on November 20, he said.“As the risk of Covid-19 infection is still high, especially with the spread of the Delta variant in the community, and the increasing number of new Covid-19 cases which have been reported, such activities will further increase the risk of Covid-19 infection within the community,” he said.Last Monday, the SPR set November 8 as the nomination date for the Melaka state election while the voting date is November 20.Khairy explained that this ban is in line with the list of unauthorised activities (negative list) in the latest SOPs for states under Phase 4 of the National Recovery Plan (PPN).Talks are rife in Sarawak that nomination day and polling day for the state election are slated for Nov 13 and Nov 27 respectively if the Yang di-Pertuan Agong wishes to repeal the EO earlier than its expiry date. ― Borneo Post",2021-10-25 23:28:05,,,malaymail

"Australia Post, NBN pay out $300 million in bonuses during COVID",https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/australia-post-nbn-pay-out-300-million-in-bonuses-during-covid-20211025-p592yu.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_politics,,['Lisa Visentin'],,The taxpayer-owned businesses spent a total of $295.9 million on employee bonuses over the past two years.,,2021-10-25 18:00:00,"Taxpayer-owned businesses Australia Post and NBN have collectively shelled out almost $300 million in personal bonuses to employees over the past two years as the COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on businesses and families. Both companies reined in their total spending on bonus payments in the 2021 financial year, with NBN splashing $46.5 million on staff, down from $78 million in the 2020 financial year , while Australia Post rewarded employees to the tune of $79 million compared with $92 million last year . Australia Post rewarded employees to the tune of $79 million compared with $92 million last year. Credit: Ryan Stuart This amounts to $295.9 million across the two years of the pandemic, the companies’ annual reports show. Public fury prompted a government crackdown on generous executive bonuses, with the Australian Public Service Commission recently issuing updated guidance to Commonwealth entities on senior executive bonuses, saying not to pay them unless there were “exceptional circumstances or a contractual obligation”. But a spokesman for Communications Minister Paul Fletcher said the new guidance would only apply from this financial year onward, adding remuneration paid by government-owned businesses “is a matter for their respective boards”. “NBN Co and Australia Post operate in a competitive commercial environment and have to attract and retain staff with the necessary skills and expertise to manage these complex telecommunications and logistics businesses,” the spokesman said. Australia Post executives who were forced to forgo their bonuses in 2020 at the height of the pandemic’s economic crisis and amid complaints about delivery delays, had them reinstated this year. Rodney Boys, who acted as chief executive for 10 months following Christine Holgate’s controversial exit in November, earned an annual salary of $1.8 million, including a $730,438 bonus this year. In total, the postal service’s top eight executives will share in a total of $4.8 million in bonuses this year, with each also receiving a bump in base salary. For example, executive general manager Nicole Sheffield received a $100,000 pay rise this year, plus a $714,000 bonus, taking her total salary to more than $1.5 million. Labor communications spokeswoman Michelle Rowland was scathing of executive payouts. “During a period of parcel delays and broader economic distress, the Australia Post board has stuffed excessive cash bonuses into the pockets of executives,” Ms Rowland said. “This is nothing short of a slap in the face to the Australian taxpayer.” NBN Co CEO Stephen Rue had his bonus cut back by almost 40 per cent to $734,000 this year. The pay packet of NBN boss Stephen Rue, who was one of the highest-paid public executives in 2020 earning a $3.1 million salary, took a trim to $2.6 million this year as his bonus was cut back by almost 40 per cent to $734,000. NBN executives were paid bonuses in both 2020 and 2021, although most were slightly reduced this year. New Australia Post boss Paul Graham, who began in the top job last month, will be paid a base salary of $1.4 million, with the possibility to double this through bonuses. Both Mr Graham and Mr Rue will appear at a Senate estimates hearing on Tuesday. An Australia Post spokesman said over 2000 payments were to frontline workers “who have managed through extraordinary circumstances to deliver for our customers and our community”. “Remuneration is regularly benchmarked externally and must be positioned competitively to attract, motivate and retain highly skilled senior managers. It reflects their responsibilities, performance, qualifications and experience,” the spokesman said. A spokesman for NBN Co said the $46.5 million in bonuses represented 5 per cent of the company’s wages and salary costs, and was spread across 3500 employees. “It is the communities’ judgement of our performance in providing affordable access to a ubiquitous, resilient and fit-for-purpose network which informs, in part, the board’s approach to setting annual incentives. The COVID circumstances have tested NBN Co and left our customers reassured,” the spokesman said.",,smh
B.C. lifting venue capacity limits across much of the province as COVID-19 cases ease,http://www.timescolonist.com/b-c-lifting-venue-capacity-limits-across-much-of-the-province-as-covid-19-cases-ease-1.24366058,,,,"VICTORIA — British Columbia is set to lift capacity restrictions on gatherings across much of the province today.

Negros Oriental appeals Alert Level 4 status,https://www.rappler.com/nation/negros-oriental-appeals-alert-level-4-status,,['Robbin M. Dagle'],,The provincial COVID-19 isolation hospital capacity is at a critical 92% but Governor Roel Degamo says their hospitals also accommodate patients from Siquijor and southern Cebu,"Fearing more economic setbacks, the provincial government of Negros Oriental has appealed the national coronavirus task force’s decision to place the province under Alert Level 4. While the province has one of the the highest COVID-19 case rates in Central Visayas and its hospital utilization rate is in the red zone, Governor Roel Degamo announced on Monday, October 25, that he was deferring the implementation of an executive order that adopts the Alert Level 4 guidelines of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF). The province’s official page shows a 92% isolation bed capacity. In the capital Dumaguete City, all hospitals are now at critical to beyond full capacity: the government-run Negros Oriental Provincial Hospital (NOPH) at 113%, Silliman University Medical Center at 90%, Holy Child Hospital at 95%, and ACE Dumaguete Doctors at 113%. Other areas in the Visayas like Bacolod City, Iloilo province, Iloilo City, and Negros Occidental were previously placed under the Department of Health’s Alert Level 4 when their hospital capacity rates hit at least 80%. Degamo, however, said one factor for the province’s full hospitals is that they accommodate patients from neighboring provinces such as Siquijor and southern Cebu. High case rates The governor said in a Facebook video that one of the reasons for the appeal is the “decline” of cases in the province. While the number of daily new cases have slightly decreased in recent days, Negros Oriental’s number of active cases is still the highest compared to neighboring provinces in Central Visayas. The provincial health office recorded a total of 2,530 active cases as of October 25. During the provincial IATF meeting on October 20, local officials expressed concern that the “unexpected declaration” would “adversely affect local businesses and jobs,” according to a report of state-run Philippine News Agency. Negros Oriental is among the 14 pilot provinces placed under the new “alert level” system from October 20 to 31. Under the new scheme, limitations are set for high-risk establishments and activities, while the fully-vaccinated enjoy certain perks depending on the alert level.  For the national government, the new scheme is supposed to be more relaxed than the old community quarantine system, as it allows full operation of less risky establishments and “non-essential” activities even underAlert Level 4. But recently, governors have also asked the national IATF for more time to study the new guidelines. Vaccination rates in Negros Oriental may also complicate the implementation of the alert level system, which has specific conditions that require full inoculation of employees in certain establishments such as restaurants, barbershops, salons, and spas. As of October 25, 163,264 residents in Negros Oriental have been fully vaccinated. This is only 17% of the 908,939 total target population of people 18 and above, and 11.3% of the province’s total population of 1.43 million. Staffing problems Degamo also appealed to the Department of Health to help the province augment hospitals’ manpower. He said that hospitals have already limited their COVID-19 beds due to the lack of healthcare workers. Dr. Liland Estacion, incident commander of the provincial IATF, said in a virtual press briefing that there were 20 vacancies for nurses in the government-run NOPH, but nobody wants to apply. “How can we accommodate people, how can we serve people nga kulang man kaayo? And then, that’s the reason why magka-COVID na kay sobra sobra na kaayo ang ratio of one nurse to a patient,” Estacion said on October 25. (How can we accommodate people, how can we serve people if we lack people? The reason why our healthcare workers get COVID is that the ratio of one nurse to a patient is too high.) “I’m now calling the deans of the school of nursing, naa’y daghang nipasar (many have passed the board exam), where are they now? Please do help our community,” she said.  Vice Governor Mark Macias earlier posted pictures of COVID patients stationed at the NOPH parking lot, as isolation facilities and beds inside were already full. – Rappler.com",2021-10-26 02:50:23,"Fearing more economic setbacks, the provincial government of Negros Oriental has appealed the national coronavirus task force's decision to place the province under Alert Level 4.

Eight things we learned from the Facebook Papers,https://www.theverge.com/22740969/facebook-files-papers-frances-haugen-whistleblower-civic-integrity,,['Russell Brandom'],,,"A massive new document release shows chaos and confusion inside the world’s most powerful social network For months, Facebook has been shaken by a steady leak of documents from whistleblower Frances Haugen, beginning in The Wall Street Journal but spreading to government officials and nearly any outlet with an interest in the company. Now, those documents are going much more public, giving us the most sweeping look at the operations of Facebook anyone not directly involved with the company has ever had. The documents stem from disclosures made to the SEC and provided to Congress by Haugen in redacted form. The Verge and a consortium of other news organizations have obtained redacted versions of the documents, which we’re calling The Facebook Papers. In order to receive the documents, we agreed to begin publishing our reporting on them this week, but we are not beholden to report on them in a certain way or coordinate what we cover with other outlets. We’ve already done some reporting on the files, and we’ll keep reporting on them over the coming weeks. (There are a lot of pages.) This isn’t a comprehensive list of everything in the documents, and you should fully expect more to come out. Instead, think of it as a summary of the files that, so far, have stood out to us the most. Hopefully, it will help you make sense of the sheer volume of Facebook news coming out this morning. Facebook was caught off guard by vaccine misinformation in comments Facebook has taken a lot of criticism for its handling of COVID misinformation — including from President Biden, who accused the platform of “killing people” by letting anti-vaxx sentiment run amok — but the leaks show just how chaotic the effort was inside the company. One document dated March 2021 shows an employee raising the alarm about how unprepared the platform was. “Vaccine hesitancy in comments is rampant,” the memo reads. “Our ability to detect vaccine-hesitant comments is bad in English, and basically non-existent elsewhere. We need Policy guidelines specifically aimed at vaccine hesitancy in comments.” (Editor’s note: We are not publishing the document itself since it contains the full name of a Facebook employee.) “Comments are a significant portion of misinfo on FB,” says another employee in an internal comment, “and are almost a complete blind spot for us in terms of enforcement and transparency right now.” “For English posts on Vaccines, vaccine hesitancy prevalence among comments is 50 percent.” The document makes clear that Facebook already had a “COVID-19 lockdown defense” project dedicated to the platform dynamics created by the pandemic, including a workstream dedicated entirely to vaccine hesitancy. That team had also created significant automated flagging systems for misinformation — but according to the files, those simply weren’t being used to downrank anti-vaccine comments. As of the March memo, there were no plans to develop moderation infrastructure like labeling, guidelines, and classifier systems to identify anti-vaccine statements in comments. The failure to meaningfully moderate comments was noticed outside the company. A First Draft News study in May looked at the comments for a handful of major news outlets with more than a million followers and found one in five comments on vaccine-related stories contained some kind of anti-vaccine misinformation. The documents show Facebook was aware of the problem, and First Draft may have even underestimated the issue. One comment on the post reads, “for English posts on Vaccines, vaccine hesitancy prevalence among comments is 50 percent.” Other aspects of the issue remained completely unstudied since the company had yet to dig in on the comment problem. “We currently don’t understand whether Group comments are a serious problem,” the post argues. “It’s clear to us that the ‘good post, bad comment’ problem is a big deal, but it’s not necessarily as clear that [vaccine hesitant] comments on [vaccine hesitant] posts are additive to the harm.” Another document published shortly after April 2021 shows the company still coming to terms with vaccine misinformation. The good news was that there was no evidence of a foreign influence campaign driving anti-vaxx sentiment, as had stung the company in 2016. But the vast majority of content was being sent by a relatively small portion of accounts, suggesting that Facebook had not yet taken the easiest measures to address the issue. Facebook has taken some steps recently to address misinformation in comments — including new downranking rules from just last week. But these documents show those changes came more than six months after the alarm had been raised internally and after Facebook had publicly expressed anxiety about the impending leak. Given the huge surge of COVID deaths among vaccine-skeptical populations over the past three months, it’s easy to see the recent changes as too little, too late. Apple threatened to ban Facebook over online “slave markets” Facebook scrambled to address human trafficking content after Apple threatened to kick its apps off the iOS App Store, a leaked SEV (or Site Event) report shows. The report, referenced briefly by The Wall Street Journal’s Facebook Files reporting, indicates that Apple threatened to pull Facebook and Instagram from iOS on October 23rd of 2019. Apple had been tipped off by a BBC News Arabic report that found domestic workers being sold via Instagram and other apps, where sellers encouraged buyers to mistreat the workers by doing things such as confiscating their passports. the policy was “highly likely leading to exploitation of domestic servants” Facebook had been aware of the problem but hadn’t understood the scope of it, apparently because very little content (less than 2 percent of the material it found) had been reported by users. “Removing our applications from Apple platforms would have had potentially severe consequences to the business,” the Facebook report notes. After Apple escalated the issue, Facebook moderators swept the platforms for keywords and hashtags mentioned in the BBC reporting, ultimately disabling 1,021 accounts and removing 129,121 pieces of content. Facebook also removed a policy exception letting established brick and mortar businesses like recruitment agencies post ads about domestic workers. Facebook determined that even if the businesses were legal, the policy was “highly likely leading to exploitation of domestic servants.” Apple was apparently satisfied with the mitigation measures, and the incident was closed within a week. The Civic Integrity team was often directly blocked by Zuckerberg One of the most alarming incidents uncovered by the papers was that Mark Zuckerberg personally intervened to ensure Facebook would comply with a repressive law instituted in Vietnam, agreeing to moderate more aggressively against “anti-state” content on the platform. The anecdote leads The Washington Post’s report on the papers and plays into a much more troubling dynamic described by Haugen before Congress. Facebook’s Integrity team had lots of ideas for how to make Facebook less harmful, but they were usually overruled, sometimes by Zuckerberg himself. Bloomberg News explores the issue in more detail, showing how the company often found its own efforts to downrank harmful content overwhelmed by the content’s inherent virality. As one employee put it, “I worry that Feed is becoming an arms race.” Politico highlights another employee quote showing just how demoralized the team had become. “If we really want to change the state of our information ecosystem, we need a revolution, not an evolution of our systems,” an employee wrote in October 2019. “If you don’t have enough good content to boost, it doesn’t matter how much you downrank the bad.” Facebook used a German anti-vaccine movement as a test case for more aggressive moderation Another document details Facebook’s so-called “Querdenken experiment,” in which the company’s moderators tested out a more aggressive moderation approach on a German conspiracy movement. Facebook’s Dangerous Content team was already developing a new classification — a “harmful topic community” — and the growing Querdenken was chosen as an experiment on how the classification would work in practice. As a Facebook employee writes in the document, “this could be a good case study to inform how we tackle these problems in the future” “this could be a good case study to inform how we tackle these problems in the future” Querdenken has become one of the leading anti-lockdown and anti-vaccination groups in Germany, with similarities to more extreme groups like QAnon. As the Facebook proposal framed it, the Querdenken movement had potential for violence but wasn’t yet linked to extreme enough activity that would justify banning followers from the platform entirely. The documents give few details about how the experiment proceeded, although clearly, some version of the Querdenken plan was implemented. (A later report says “results from some initial samples look promising.”) And judging by the company’s public statements, it did result in a meaningful change to moderation policy: in September, Facebook announced a new policy on “coordinated social harm,” specifically citing Querdenken as an example of the new approach in action. Unlike many of the other documents, the Querdenken experiment shows Facebook’s moderation system as relatively effective. The company identified the group before it caused significant harm, took action with an eye towards long-term consequences and was transparent about the policy shift after it took place. But the incident shows how complex the interplay of policy and enforcement can be, with broader policies often rewritten with an eye towards specific groups. And for supporters of Querdenken, it may be alarming to learn that the rules of the world’s largest social platform were rewritten specifically to keep their movement from gaining public support. Facebook’s January 6th response was shaped by glitches and delays Facebook discussed developing extreme “break-glass measures” to limit misinformation, calls to violence, and other material that could disrupt the 2020 presidential election. But when former President Donald Trump and his supporters tried to stop successor Joe Biden from being declared president on January 6th, 2021, Facebook employees complained these measures were implemented too late or stymied by technical and bureaucratic hangups. Reports at Politico and The New York Times outline Facebook’s struggle to handle users delegitimizing the elections. Internally, critics said Facebook didn’t have a sufficient game plan for “harmful non-violating narratives” that toed the line between misinformation and content Facebook wants to preserve as free speech. And some plans, like a change that would have prevented Groups from changing their names to terms like “Stop the Steal,” apparently got held up by technical problems. Facebook was trying to rebalance its News Feed for “civic health” The Wall Street Journal first revealed that news outlets and political parties had complained about users favoring negative and hyperbolic content. Facebook was considering ways to fix the problem, and one method involved re-weighting the News Feed to optimize for “civic health” instead of primarily focusing on meaningful social interactions or session time. In a product briefing called “Ranking For Civic Health,” Facebook acknowledged that “people think that political content on Facebook is low quality, untrustworthy, and divisive,” and the current ranking system was “not creating a wholly valuable civic experience for users.” (Based on document comment dates, the document was produced around January and February of 2020.) “people think that political content on Facebook is low quality, untrustworthy, and divisive” The document says Facebook’s ranking algorithm recommended civic content that users themselves didn’t report finding valuable — something earlier leaks have indicated was a problem with meaningful social interactions (MSI) and other engagement-based metrics. “Our current ranking objectives do not optimize for integrity outcomes, which can have dangerous consequences,” it says — for instance, MSI optimization was “contributing hugely to Civic misinfo,” and Facebook estimated that removing it from Civic posts would decrease it by 30 to 50 percent. Facebook tried to improve civic health by asking users explicitly what they thought constituted good civic content. This sometimes revealed even bigger problems — since Facebook apparently found that 20 to 30 percent of respondents “may say that known Civic hate is ‘good for the community’” in surveys. Facebook settled on a strategy to “prioritize the reduction of policy-violating content — such as Civic Hate or Civic Misinfo — even if the individual user finds it valuable” and aimed to reduce the prevalence of civic hate speech, misinformation, and inflammatory content by at least 10 percent. The company ran rebalancing experiments in February 2020 by slightly increasing the amount of “civic” News Feed content that a random set of users saw, then optimizing that content through different metrics (including MSI and whether people thought content was “worth your time”). It also ran a survey to collect how users felt about civic News Feed content. The company aimed to have a new optimization system chosen by March of 2020 — although it’s not clear how the coronavirus pandemic may have changed those plans. Why likes were never hidden on Facebook and Instagram A highly publicized plan from early last year to hide like counts on Instagram never happened because testing the change hurt ad revenue and led to people using the app less. A quiet test of the experience on the Facebook app was also killed after leadership told Zuckerberg that it wasn’t a “top barrier to sharing nor a top concern for people.” A lengthy internal presentation to Zuckerberg about the plan, dubbed Project Daisy, shows that there were concerns among leadership about how the Facebook app would have been perceived if Instagram hid like counts and Facebook did not, which is something employees who were involved in the project have told The Verge. Employees working on Instagram wanted to bill it as a way to depressurize the app for young people, but the team working on the Facebook app wasn’t into the idea. If Instagram went through with hiding likes, the presentation details how leadership at Facebook wanted to “minimize blowback to the Facebook app” for not hiding them and still “ensure credit ladders up to the Facebook company.” Instead of hiding likes for all users by default as was originally planned, Instagram earlier adopted a half measure by letting people opt into hiding their likes. Facebook’s “civic groups” policy stumbled over a simple design flaw In October 2020, Facebook announced that it would stop recommending civic and political groups to users in the US as part of a broader effort to avoid the mistakes of the 2016 election. (The policy was made permanent shortly after the January 6th riot.) But actually keeping those groups out of Facebook recommendation feeds has been a huge challenge for the company — and an internal document gives us new insight into why. The document shows Facebook employees grappling with a public article, flagged by the PR team, which found 30 separate groups still appearing in recommendation feeds in apparent violation of the policy. Escalated on January 19th, the document says many of the groups named in the report had been labeled as civic groups at one point — but were somehow still being recommended as part of facebook’s Groups You Should Join feature. Reducing churn could have solved almost all of the problems “Leakage has been there since Nov 2020 at the least,” the Facebook document reads. It’s not clear which article the document is referring to, but there were a number of reports spotting enforcement failures at the time. The Markup found a bunch of groups slipping through that January and again in June. Even now, it’s not clear the civic groups policy is being enforced as intended. At the time, most observers focused on the conceptual difficulty: it’s a hard philosophical problem to draw a clear line between which groups count as “civic” and even harder to scale it across a platform of Facebook’s size. But the internal report shows the real problem was much simpler. Facebook’s monitoring system (referred to in the report as “Laser”) had been trained to only look at the past seven days of content when determining whether a page fell into the “civic groups” category, which meant pages were constantly filtering in and out as the period viewed by the algorithm changed. In practice, that meant a pro-Trump or pro-Biden group could easily dodge the label by posting a few days worth of less obviously political content. The report estimates that a full 12 percent of labeled groups would churn out of the category from day to day. According to the report, 90 percent of the groups highlighted by the article had been caught by Facebook’s existing “civic groups” classifier — but they’d filtered out as part of the churn. So reducing churn alone could have solved almost all of the problems spotted by the report. There have been lots of stories like this over the past five years: Facebook sets a policy that seems measured and responsible, but a cursory test (usually from a journalist) shows banned content is still easily slipping through. From the outside, it’s often unclear how much of the problem is incompetence at Facebook and how much is just the inherent difficulty of managing a platform of that size. But in this case, the documents put the blame squarely on Facebook as a company. This was a high-profile policy with huge stakes for the country at large, with obvious delicacy in how it was implemented. A churn rate that high made it inevitable that targeted groups would slip through the cracks, and the company simply didn’t notice until reporters called them out.",2021-10-25 15:40:19,,,theverge

Horgan says the majority of health-care workers are immunized and often perplexed about why others wouldn't follow the science behind vaccination and the advice of provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry. The vaccine mandate will apply to everyone who works in health-care settings, including students, doctors, contractors and volunteers. Those who don't have their first dose by the deadline can't work unless they have a recognized medical exemption. Workers who get their first shot before Nov. 15 can resume working seven days after the first dose, but they must wear personal protective equipment and take other precautions until they have their second dose, which must be no more than 35 days after the initial dose. Staff at long-term care homes and assisted living facilities needed to be fully vaccinated by Oct. 12. British Columbia is reporting 1,618 new cases of COVID-19, 20 deaths and five new health-care facility outbreaks over the last three days.

Used car market likely to enjoy continued growth,https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/2204155/used-car-market-likely-to-enjoy-continued-growth,,,,"Thailand's used car market is expected to continue growing, thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic which boosted its growth to 20-30%, said the Association of Used Cars.",,2021-10-25 21:00:00,"Thailand's used car market is expected to continue growing, thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic which boosted its growth to 20-30%, said the Association of Used Cars. The used car market recorded a 10% growth on yearly average before the pandemic hit Thailand at the beginning of 2020. ""Normally the used car market grows slowly. Around 1-2 million cars are sold each year,"" said Pinyo Tanawatcharaporn, president of the Association of Used Cars. Second-hand car sales are usually one time higher than the sales of new cars. The pandemic alerted people to the chance of catching the highly contagious virus on public transport, causing many of them to buy cars, said Mr Pinyo. Second-hand cars are more attractive to people who cannot afford to buy new cars with higher price tags. Among used cars are those from motorists who could not pay instalments during the pandemic and saw them seized by creditors, including banks and financial institutions, though they are still in good condition. Average prices of used cars are 30-40% lower than those of new cars. ""The used car market is taking advantage of the government's lockdown easing and its plan to reopen Thailand. These factors have created good sentiments among prospective car buyers,"" said Mr Pinyo. Drastic lockdown approaches, including strict travel restrictions and a night-time curfew, which were enforced early last year, caused a drop in second-hand car prices, but the situation has bottomed out leading to a growth in the used car market, he said. Kasikorn Research Center expects second-hand car prices to go up by 5.5-7.5% this year due mainly to the pandemic's impact. The increase will be even higher in used car markets overseas. However, the prices will not sharply increase partly because of more supply of used cars seized by financial institutions from owners who failed to pay instalments, said Kasikorn Research Center. Consumers' lower purchasing power and banks' strict criteria to grant car loans also curbed the price increase. Kasikorn Research Center expects used car prices will continue to increase next year due to the recovery of purchasing power in the business sector, leading to more demand for used vehicles, especially trucks. Better business prospects for new car sales are also expected as the Federation of Thai Industries' automotive club believes car production will grow beyond the target of 1.6 million units this year amid falling Covid-19 infections and an easing of the semiconductor shortage situation. The bright business prospects come after the easing of lockdown in many countries and a greater supply of computer chips, according to the club. The Covid-19 situation is now better than it has been in months, resulting in a boost to business confidence and people's purchasing power, said Surapong Paisitpatanapong, vice-chairman and spokesman for the FTI's automotive club. The car production target for 2021 was earlier set at 1.55-1.6 million units, with 800,000-850,000 units to be exported. From January to September, domestic car production increased by 25.6% year-on-year to 1,211,946 units, according to the club. Though car production in September dropped by 6.43% year-on-year to 140,038 units, production prospects are expected to get better.",,bangkokpost

A ccording to two of the country’s leading paranormal investigation groups, Ireland ranks among the highest in the world for paranormal activity. Some of Ireland’s spookiest sites include Kilmainhan Gaol in Dublin, Loftus Hall in Wexford, Ross Castle in Meath and Spike Island in Cork, as well as Charleville and Leap Castles in Offaly. Paranormal investigators consider that, on a per capita basis, Offaly ranks as the most haunted county in Ireland. Irish Paranormal Investigations (IPI) official Ann Massey said reports of increased activity had included a surging number of contacts from the public about unexplained occurrences in people’s homes, not just known haunted houses and castles. Read More ‘Hospitals are at full tilt’: Urgent demand to give health workers the booster jab It is believed the traumatic impact on society of the world’s worst pandemic since the 1918 Spanish Flu has somehow heightened contacts between the living and spirit worlds. Ms Massey said such ‘step-over’ activity between the human and spirit worlds was common in times of societal trauma such as wars and pandemics. “From our perspective as a group we have been getting a lot more contact from people – especially in their private houses,” she said. “It is twofold – more people are more aware of what is going on around them now and noticing these step-overs from the spirit realm.

The IPI team includes Ms Massey, Dominic McElroy, Liam Canty and up to three others. Their investigations range from measuring physical, electrical and temperature changes through to examining the history and even archaeology of an area. Most haunted houses have exploited their paranormal legends with successful commercial offerings ranging from ghost tours to Halloween parties. Leap Castle even offers a special evening meal dubbed ‘Dining with the Dead’. However, the most feared site in Ireland is the Hellfire Club located at Montpelier Hill in Dublin. Built as a hunting lodge, legend has it the structure disturbed an ancient burial site – and has been troubled by angry spirits ever since. But its dark reputation dates from the mid-18th century when it was rumoured to have been used by the Hellfire Club, a group of dissolute nobles, for parties. Such was the behaviour of the group that it was even rumoured the building hosted ‘black masses’ – and that at each dinner a chair was deliberately left empty in case Satan decided to attend. Ms Massey said paranormal activity noted at the Hellfire Club had even extended to the estate grounds and woods. She said such was Ireland’s rich folklore history that almost every part of the country had stories of hauntings and supernatural activity. “Just like history has layers, so does supernatural activity,” she said. Ms Massey said her favourite investigation sites in Ireland were Dundrum, Tipperary and Cork’s Spike Island. “Prisons are places where there can be a lot of paranormal activity,” she said. Co-founder of Paranormal Supernatural Investigations Ireland (PSI), Richard Morrison (42), said Ireland was noted on an international scale for its residual energy and paranormal activity. “I think Ireland is up there in the top two at least, even as paranormal researchers we’re amazed. “We find that 95pc of the evidence that we capture is after the investigation from our appointment that’s gathered the evidence. “It’s very rarely something will happen visually, it’s our equipment that’s capturing all this. Ireland has a lot of history and the energy here is very active for paranormal researching. “We believe the whole land itself has got a lot of residual energy,” he said. Mr Morrison said the group preferred not to be referred to as ‘ghost hunters’; he said they researched locations that they believed had residual energy. “We research an area, analyse our evidence and see if we can back up any of the claims that the place is spiritually haunted,” he said. Mr Morrison has had personal experiences with paranormal activity since he was a young child. “My great-grandfather passed away during an operation. I always remember I asked, ‘Would you ever visit me, Granddad, if you died?’ and his exact words were, ‘Of course I’d come and visit you’. “He went in for a routine operation and he sadly passed away. A few nights after his death I woke up and for some reason my head was drawn to my bedside table, I remember seeing this luminous green outline of a person and I got the feeling that I knew that was my grandfather. “I was only six. Children are very open, they have their third eye and they’re very spiritually connected. “They can see things that maybe adults can’t see and as we get older, we tend to close that spiritual side of us. The second night that same incident happened again. “Then, when I was 15 I saw the same figure was standing at the bottom of my bed. I ran into my parents’ bedroom and told them. “My parents always told me it was a dream.” He went on: “It is nice to share the evidence that we’ve been gathering with people. Some people will always be sceptical and that’s the way human nature is. The way we work we just put the evidence out there and we let people decide for themselves.” Mr Morrison said the Galway-based group recently captured a photo of a ghostly figure in the window of Moore Hall in Co Mayo. “The image is as clear as day,” he said. “There’s no inside stairs or floors, it’s a complete shell of a house. “We love to go investigate these places because we research the history of the location.” Read More ‘Hospitals are at full tilt’: Urgent demand to give health workers the booster jab",https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/23eb4/40980812.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/atural%20Galway%2019543.jpg,independent

The post LOOK: Megan Thee Stallion’s college graduation pics leave fans inspired appeared first on HITC.,"Megan Thee Stallion is giving us all some much-needed inspiration as the Grammy winner graduated from college over the past weekend. The Texas native took some dank pictures from her commencement ceremony, to which she wore a stunning, bedazzled ‘real hot girl sh*t’ cap. While Megan looked stunning, the cap certainly became a show-stealer, while giving a not-so-subtle nod to her 2019 hit song Hot Girl Summer. SEE: Meet Micah Beals, actor who allegedly vandalized George Floyd’s statues View this post on Instagram A post shared by Megan Thee Stallion (@theestallion) Megan Thee Stallion college graduation pics explored The Savage singer took to her Instagram to post a slideshow of images from her college graduation ceremony. The pics see the 26-year-old looking absolutely gorgeous as she holds her ‘real hot girl sh*t’ cap. Megan is seen pouting and looking proudly at the camera as he shows off her cap. We also love her red and white manicures that contain the school’s acronym on them.   The singer wrote in the caption, “2021 finna graduate collegeeee taking my graduation pics today I can’t wait for y’all to see.” Hence, fans can expect to see more pictures from the ceremony. We are dying to see what the star wore on her special day. Back in June 2020, the three-time Grammy winner had explained why she didn’t let her fame get in the way of her education. In a candid interview with People, the Girls In The Hood singer said, “‘I want to get my degree because I really want my mom to be proud. She saw me going to school before she passed.” Megan’s mom, Holly Thomas, died in March 2019 after fighting brain cancer. The singer, who has been through her fair share of pain and loss in life, also lost her grandmother around the same time. Both these women have inspired her to be the star she is today. The singer, who was a part-time student at Texas Southern University, graduated with a degree in Health Administration. During COVID-19, Megan completed her classes online, just like other students around the world. SEE: Who is TikTok’s Jinnkid? Ali Abulaban’s charges explored View this post on Instagram A post shared by Megan Thee Stallion (@theestallion) Fans react to the singer’s latest achievement Megan’s fans already know that she is inspired by other educators in her family. Her grandma, who was a teacher, was her motivator to finish school. ‘I’m doing it for me, but I’m also doing it for the women in my family who made me who I am today,’ the rapper said in her interview with People. Fans were clearly over the moon to see the star’s latest accomplishment.

Megan has been keeping her fans up to date about her Health Administration Degree for years now. While the singer is yet to shed light on her detailed plans on how she will use this degree, she has revealed some of them. The singer previously expressed her interest in creating a healthcare facility post her graduation. She even suggested that she plans to hire her classmates. You Go Girl!!

He said on CNN: “Who has he fought? Deontay Wilder and Klitschko, he can’t call himself the greatest. “OK, you might be the best heavyweight around in your era now because you haven’t lost, then you beat everyone put in front of you. “But you’re not the greatest. You haven’t even achieved half of what Lennox Lewis has achieved: Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, George Foreman- all of these guys.” Whyte is currently the WBC ‘interim’ champion, putting him in line to challenge for Fury’s world title.

Vivo X70 Pro+ review: A versatile premium flagship in the true sense,https://www.business-standard.com/article/technology/vivo-x70-pro-review-a-versatile-premium-flagship-in-the-true-sense-121102501592_1.html,,,,"Vivo, in collaboration with Zeiss, has taken things a little further as the X70 Pro offers a fine imaging experience it does not compromise on any parameter",,2021-10-26 06:48:15,"It hasn't been long since Vivo launched its X60 series ( review ) that placed the Chinese smartphone maker at a fine spot in the cluttered smartphone market in India. And Vivo did not take long to launch its X70 series, yet again in collaboration with lens major Zeiss. The X70 series is geared towards content creators as imaging remains a focus here, not just that, the new series also features Vivo’s V1 imaging chip, which the company claims took almost two years to develop. That said, Vivo’s X60 Pro and X60 Pro+ had already set the bar so high for rivals and now with a new iteration in the X series, it remains to be seen if Vivo lives up to the expectation. I took the X70 Pro+ for a spin—from photography to gaming, I put the phone to a stiff test to see what’s on offer. I’ll talk about everything this phone has to offer in this review: Vivo X70 Pro+: Design and build quality The very first thing one notices in the X70 Pro+ is the rear camera module that gives this phone a distinct look and premium touch. Right next to it is a reflective panel which, it seems, is only to add more element to its looks. The next thing is the smooth, fingerprint resistant matte glass finish which makes the piece all the more premium. The overall body is pretty simple: there are three buttons on the right edge for volume and power, a USB-C and, yes, a speaker grill at the bottom. At 213g, this phone can’t be called lightweight —it feels heavy in the pocket or while you hold it. Due to its aesthetics, the piece is a bit slippery, so one has to be really careful. I had to use the faux leather cover that comes in the package to get a slightly better grip. The phone has stereo speakers, a USB-C at the bottom, and a SIM card tray right next to it. Overall, the X70 Pro+ is second to none when it comes to looks, the only thing is it’s slightly heavy and large, so a bit of care is needed for everyday use. Vivo X70 Pro+: Display The X70 Pro+ boasts a 6.7-inch WQHD+ AMOLED curved display. The display has a Schott Xensation protection, so the phone may be able to handle accidental falls on some occasions. Overall, the display is crisp and bright, even when uses outdoors. Vivo has done a great job with the display as watching any web series or gaming makes it worthwhile. The display also supports HDR10+ so high-quality videos look even better. Moreover, The panel features a 120Hz refresh rate so things are pretty smooth, be it gaming or usual scrolling. Finally, Vivo has also fixed the speaker issue as now you get stereo speaker setup, with the earpiece doubling up as the second speaker. I must say the speakers are loud and watching anything without earphones is not the problem now. Also new is the IP68 rating which means you get good protection against dust and water. Vivo X70 Pro+ performance The X70 Pro+ has pretty much everything you can ask for from a flagship device -- powered with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888+ processor, which is a minor upgrade to the Snapdragon 888, this phone has 12GB of LPDDR5 RAM and 256GB of UFS 3.1 storage. The FunTouch OS has improved significantly and it's safe to say there is less clutter or any other fuss. While the regular social media, multimedia, or any other task is a breeze for a device this powerful, the real test was if it can handle intense gaming, for that, I played Call of Duty and a few other games, and I must say, it was a smooth experience. What's even better is the speakers are now better than what it was in X60 Pro, so you get a proper gaming feel. Vivo X70 Pro+: Battery Vivo X70 Pro+ camera sample Vivo X70 Pro+ features a 4,500mAh battery which can easily last for a day with regular social media use, calls, some gaming and a lot of photography. You can easily rely on this phone's battery if you are usually out for long hours. The battery takes about an hour to charge fully. The package includes a 55W charger and this phone supports 50W wireless charging for which the dock will be available soon. Vivo X70 Pro+: Camera Vivo X70 Pro+ camera sample This is where it gets even interesting as there is plenty to write about the cameras in Vivo X70 Pro+. In total, you get four rear cameras including a 50-megapixel wide-angle camera, a 48-megapixel ultra-wide-angle camera with gimbal for stabilisation, a 12-megapixel telephoto camera with 2X optical zoom, and an 8-megapixel telephoto camera with 5X optical zoom. There is a 32-megapixel camera for selfies. Vivo X70 Pro+ camera sample What's different this time is Vivo's Imaging Chip V1 which helps the camera with accuracy and colours. All the shooters have a Zeiss T coating which reduces lens glare. To put it simply, the cameras work brilliantly in both indoor and outdoor photography. The images are crisp, bright, full of details with impressive colour accuracy. The image quality exceeds expectations if given the right light conditions. Vivo X70 Pro+ camera sample At times, images look over sharp but that's something we have often seen in Vivo phones. There is 5X optical Zoom up to which the images come out really well, beyond that, you get 60x digital zoom which isn't too impressive, but good to have in scenarios where you are too far from the subject. Vivo X70 Pro+ camera sample I tried night photography and while a lot depends on the light conditions, on some occasions, I was able to get good details while capturing the night sky. Rest, outdoor photography is fun using this phone. There are several features you can try including, Astro mode, long exposure, Slo-mo, Supermoon, etc. You also get good selfies with impressive edge detection. Vivo X70 Pro+ camera sample The Zeiss portrait mode will make you want to click more pictures as the background blurring is on point most of the time. You can record 8K videos at 30 fps, 4K videos up to 60 fps, besides the usual 1080p videos. There is also a feature for high stabilisation in case you are moving while recording a video. Vivo X70 Pro+ camera sample I had a great time recording videos on this phone. They come out really well and the phone captures the sound easily. Overall, the cameras are powerful and capable. Vivo X70 Pro+: Verdict At Rs 79,999, Vivo X70 Pro+ is a complete device with several features, an amazing camera, and performance. This is truly a premium flagship and justifies its heavy price tag.

Hong Kong convicts second person under national security law,https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/hong-kong-convicts-second-person-under-national-security-law-1.5638329,,['The Associated Press'],,"Hong Kong has convicted a second person under its sweeping national security law for chanting pro-independence slogans, amid a political crackdown in the city.",,2021-10-26 06:47:53,"HONG KONG -- Hong Kong has convicted a second person under its sweeping national security law for chanting pro-independence slogans, amid a political crackdown in the city. Ma Chun-man was convicted of inciting secession on Monday after he was found to have chanted slogans such as ""Hong Kong independence, the only way out"" on 20 occasions between August and November of last year. Critics in Hong Kong say the National Security Law erodes freedoms, such as those of expression and assembly, that were promised to the city for 50 years when the former British colony was handed over to China in 1997. Ma is the second person to be convicted under the new law, which outlaws what authorities describe as secession, subversion of state power, terrorism and foreign collusion in intervening in Hong Kong's affairs. Ma had been arrested multiple times for chanting such slogans before being remanded in custody. Sentencing for Ma was adjourned to Nov. 11, and he faces up to seven years in jail. Tong Ying-kit, the first person to be convicted under the national security law, was jailed for nine years for inciting secession and terrorism after he drove his motorcycle into a group of police officers last July while bearing a flag with the banned slogan ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times."" The majority of the city's prominent pro-democracy activists have been arrested for taking part in unauthorized assemblies, and dozens of political organizations and trade unions have ceased operation out of concern for their members' safety under the security law. Over 120 people have been arrested under the security law since it was implemented last June.

He was 88.",2021-10-26 06:46:08,"SEOUL, South Korea — Former South Korean President Roh Tae-woo, who participated in a military coup then won the election that was the country’s first move toward democracy before he was imprisoned for corruption, died on Tuesday. He was 88. The Seoul National University Hospital said Roh died while being treated for an illness. It gave no further details. Roh was a key participant in the 1979 military coup that made his army friend and coup leader Chun Doo-hwan president after their mentor, dictator Park Chung-hee, was assassinated earlier in 1979. Roh led his army division into Seoul and joined other military leaders for operations to seize the capital. The coup and the subsequent crackdown by the Chun-controlled military on pro-democracy protesters in the southern city of Gwangju in 1980 are two of the darkest chapters in South Korea’s turbulent modern history. About 200 people were killed in the military-led crackdowns in Gwangju, according to government records. Roh was Chun’s hand-picked successor, which would have assured him the presidency in an easy indirect election. But months of massive pro-democracy uprisings in 1987 forced Roh and Chun to accept a direct presidential poll that was the start of South Korea’s transition to democracy. Roh, despite his military background, built a moderate and genial image during the campaign, calling himself an “average person.” His victory in the hotly contested December 1987 election was largely attributable to a split in opposition votes between Kim Young-sam and Kim Dae-jung, who both later became presidents. During his five-year term, Roh aggressively pursued ties with communist nations under his “Northward Diplomacy” as communism fell in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union dissolved. South Korea was then deeply anti-communist because of its rivalry with North Korea, but under Roh it opened diplomatic relations with a communist nation for the first time — Hungary in 1989, the year when the Berlin Wall fell and communism crumbled across Eastern Europe. Roh established relations with the Soviet Union in 1990 and with China in 1992. Relations with North Korea improved under Roh, with the two sides holding their first-ever prime ministers’ talks in 1990 and both countries joining the United Nations at the same time in 1991. Ties between the rivals have suffered huge setbacks and subsequent retreats in recent years, with Pyongyang pursuing a nuclear weapons program it sees as a means of survival. On domestic issues, Roh was seen by many as lacking charismatic and aggressive leadership. His nickname, “Mul (Water) Tae-woo,” implied his administration had no color and no taste. He also brought more openness by allowing more political lampooning, in contrast with his authoritarian predecessors, Park and Chun. The governments led by Park and Chun often used security laws to suppress political opponents and restrict speech under the pretext of guarding against civil disorder and North Korean threats. In his later years as president, Roh concentrated on boosting domestic consumption to make up for exports that were slowed by global economic downturns, only to be dealt the lowest full-year growth rate in his tenure. After his successor, Kim Young-sam, investigated the coup and military-led crackdown, Roh was arrested, convicted of mutiny, treason and corruption and received a 22 1/2 prison term. Chun was sentenced to death. The Supreme Court reduced those sentences to life imprisonment for Chun and 17 years for Roh. Both were still ordered to pay back hundreds of millions of dollars they collected illegally. After spending about two years in prison, both Roh and Chun were released in late 1997 under a special pardon requested by then President-elect Kim Dae-jung, who sought national reconciliation amid an Asian financial crisis. Kim Dae-jung was a former dissident whom the military junta led by Chun and Roh had sentenced to death on trumped-up charges of masterminding the 1980 civil uprising. Roh had stayed mostly out of the public eye following his release from prison, refraining from political activities and speeches.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/roh-tae-woo-1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all,nypost

It has found the behaviour of the casino’s operator, Crown Resorts to be “disgraceful”, with practices that have been “variously illegal, dishonest, unethical and exploitative”. But royal commissioner Ray Finkelstein has also decided the economic effects of Crown losing its licence, the impact on innocent parties, and the company’s belated attempts at rehabilitation mean it should keep its casino licence – at least for now. The Victorian government has accepted this recommendation. It will appoint a “special manager” – Stephen O'Bryan QC, a former commissioner with the state’s anti-corruption commission – to oversee the casino’s operations over the next two years. After two years O'Bryan will prepare a report for the new gambling regulator the Victorian government will establish in response to the deficiencies identified with the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation. The new beefed-up regulator, to be known as the Victorian Gambling and Casino Control Commission, will then decide if Crown keeps its licence. The government has also announced it will repeal provisions enabling Crown to be compensated for any regulatory changes affecting its business. It will also increase the maximum penalty for breaches of the Casino Control Act from A$1 million to A$100 million. This is all good. But all these things should, of course, have been in place far earlier. It is the failure of regulation, and the politics that sit behind it, that made the Crown Melbourne debacle possible, and perhaps inevitable. As with other gambling businesses, Crown’s political influence has been significant, and a key feature of its business model. Politically and socially well connected directors and staff were recruited, clearly with an eye to their ability to influence governments. Their aim, it seems, was to make Crown too big to be regulated. They seem to have succeeded. Read more: Crown Resorts is not too big to fail. It has failed already Recommendations kicked down the road Beyond the government’s headline announcements, some of Commissioner Finkelstein’s key recommendations have been kicked down the road – until next year, at least. These include those addressing money laundering, and changes to the operator’s structure. The latter relate to reductions in maximum shareholdings, and the independence of the board and senior management. Also deferred is any response to the recommendations focused on gambling harm prevention and minimisation. Many in favour of gambling reform will be encouraged by Finkelstein’s focus on these. The government says it accepts all his recommendations, but exactly how it will act on them requires “further detailed analysis and consultation”. Finkelstein focused on the harms of gambling, finding that: Crown Melbourne had for years held itself out as having a world’s best approach to problem gambling. Nothing can be further from the truth. His recommendations to improve Crown’s paltry “responsible gambling” program are far reaching and significant. They include implementing a comprehensive pre-commitment system, requiring gamblers to establish accounts and set limits of time and money. This would establish an effective self-exclusion system for the first time, in which those struggling with gambling would be able to ban themselves from gambling without the possibility of easily revoking that arrangement. Australia’s Productivity Commission recommended a pre-commitment system in its 2010 report on gambling. The Gillard government was set to implement that recommendation, but ClubsNSW spearheaded a successful campaign to sink the plan. The gambling lobby will no doubt be keenly interested in how the Victorian government responds to Finkelstein’s recommendation, which goes further than the Productivity Commission by recommending a default loss limit and regulated breaks in use. Reversing the ‘responsible gambling’ discourse Finkelstein’s report recommends the casino also have “a duty to take all reasonable steps to prevent and minimise harm from gambling”. This effectively reverses the “responsible gambling” discourse which puts the onus on gamblers – and arguably blames them for harming themselves. Such a change, if well implemented, has the potential to finally make harm prevention a high priority in gaming regulation. The report also recommends that casino data be made available for proper research purposes. It points out the importance, and difficulty, of obtaining such data. Without it, evaluating the casino’s personal and social impacts is virtually impossible. This too would be a big step forward in harm prevention and reduction efforts. It could also help with anti money-laundering endeavours. Read more: Responsible gambling – a bright shining lie Crown Resorts and others can no longer hide behind A blueprint for wider regulation Assuming its board and executives have the nous to clean up the business to the necessary standard, Crown Resorts will get to keep its Melbourne casino. This will shock many, given what has transpired. Political will is needed. The outcome may be that a powerful and harmful gambling business is cleaned up. Or the situation may revert to business as usual – the default position for gambling regulation. This depends on what the Victorian government does with the recommendations on which it has postponed action. Read more: The Crown allegations show the repeated failures of our gambling regulators Most of the money Victorians (and Australians) gamble away is through poker machines in local clubs and pubs. The Finkelstein royal commission has provided an important blueprint to tackle that gambling harm, too. The Victorian government could lead the way by extending Finkelstein’s recommendations to all gambling businesses. No business, or sector, should be too big to be regulated. Charles Livingstone has received funding from the Victorian Responsible Gambling Foundation, the (former) Victorian Gambling Research Panel, and the South Australian Independent Gambling Authority (the funds for which were derived from hypothecation of gambling tax revenue to research purposes), from the Australian and New Zealand School of Government and the Foundation for Alcohol Research and Education, and from non-government organisations for research into multiple aspects of poker machine gambling, including regulatory reform, existing harm minimisation practices, and technical characteristics of gambling forms. He has received travel and co-operation grants from the Alberta Problem Gambling Research Institute, the Finnish Institute for Public Health, the Finnish Alcohol Research Foundation, the Ontario Problem Gambling Research Committee, and the Problem Gambling Foundation of New Zealand. He was a Chief Investigator on an Australian Research Council funded project researching mechanisms of influence on government by the tobacco, alcohol and gambling industries. He has undertaken consultancy research for local governments and non-government organisations in Australia and the UK seeking to restrict or reduce the concentration of poker machines and gambling impacts, and was a member of the Australian government's Ministerial Expert Advisory Group on Gambling in 2010-11.

The post 12 of the Best Couch Co-op Games to Play With Real Live Friends appeared first on Gizmodo Australia.","Online multiplayer is great, but sometimes you want to plop down on the sofa next to your friend or spouse and play a game on the same screen. These 12 split-screen games were all released within the last five years, and any would make an excellent choice on your next couch co-op game night. A Way Out (2018) A Way Out is a rarity: A top-tier, AAA game that can only be played in split-screen with another player, ensuring “player 2” isn’t just an afterthought to a single-player campaign. The narrative is smart and novel — you are convicts helping each other escape from a maximum security prison — and every aspect of A Way Out was designed for cooperation, from the levels, to the puzzles, to the mini games. If you play no other game on this list, play A Way Out. Available on: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Android, Microsoft Windows Snipperclips: Cut it Out, Together (2017) In this friendly puzzle-solving game, you and your partner control Snip and Clip, two paper characters who cut each other up into different shapes to solve puzzles. By offering multiple solutions to each level, Snipperclips rewards creativity and brains over gamer-reflexes, so everyone, from hardcore gamers to brand noobs, is on a level playing field. Available on: Nintendo Switch Phogs! (2020) In this cartoonish cooperative puzzle platformer, each player controls half of a double-doggo — a cute little pup with two heads and one stretchy belly. Working together, you and your pal solve puzzles by stretching, barking, and biting as you traverse worlds themed around everything dogs love best: Food, sleep, and playing. In a word: Delightful. Available on: PlayStation 4, Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, Google Stadia, Xbox One Untitled Goose Game (2019) I thought Untitled Goose Game couldn’t possibly be any better; then they added a second goose. Another malevolent waterfowl opens up new possibilities for bedeviling the put-upon townspeople, and now there’s twice as much honking. (So much sweet, sweet honking.) Available on: PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Microsoft Windows, Xbox One, macOS, Macintosh operating systems, Classic Mac OS Unravel 2 (2018) In this lush, beautiful platformer, you and your pal are Yarnies, little creatures made of yarn. To solve puzzles and beat levels, you unravel yourselves and work together to swing across gaps, rappel down cliffs, tie things up, and dream of becoming sweaters one day, I assume. Available on: PlayStation 4, Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One Mario Kart 8 (2014), Mario Kart 8: Deluxe (2017) I know I said I would only include cooperative games released in the last five years and Mario Kart 8 technically fits neither criteria — unless, ahhh, you’re playing Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on Switch, which dropped in 2017. If that offends you, well, I just couldn’t handle making a list of split-screen games and without including the latest entry in the greatest couch co-op franchise of all time. Please do not call the police on me. Available on: Wii U, Nintendo Switch Human: Fall Flat (2016) Up to eight people can play Human: Fall Flat together online, and only two can play it locally, but it’s better to play it locally anyway. The intentionally kludgy controls for the Schmoo-like main dude, and the constant obstacles he faces, create slapstick humour better enjoyed with a friend. Also: You might need a second brain to solve the harder puzzles. Available on: Windows, Linux, macOS, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Stadia, Nintendo Switch, Android, iOS, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5 It Takes Two (2021) From Hazelight Studios, the same developer as A Way Out, It Takes Two tells the story of a couple on the verge of divorce. Rather than seek a qualified marriage counselor, they are transformed into doll versions of themselves and must learn to work together through solving platforming puzzles. It’s a head-scratching premise, but the gameplay really explores the possibilities of cooperation within a game, and it looks amazing. Available on: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and Series S, Microsoft Windows Call of Duty: WWII (2017) It’s a shame the main campaign of Call of Duty: WWII isn’t co-op, but I’ll take what I can get: Zombies mode, where you and up to three friends face off against hordes of undead Nazis. The ridiculous comedy premises of more recent COD zombie modes have been axed in favour of a deeper, more story-driven, and definitely darker experience. The see-how-long-you-can-survive gameplay that makes Zombie mode so fun was left intact, thankfully. Available on: Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One Luigi’s Mansion 3 (2018) Luigi’s Mansion 3 offers an unbelievable level of couch co-op. A friend can drop in at any time during the story and play as “Gooigi,” Luigi’s twin made of goo. Luigi’s gooey doppelganger has special powers to enter new parts of maps. There’s also ScareScraper Mode, a mini-campaign where up to four Switches can be connected either locally or online, and each can host two players. That’s eight Luigis and Gooigis running around collecting coins and being scared by ghosts! That might even be too many Luigis, if such a thing is even possible. Available on: Nintendo Switch Cuphead (2017) I can’t decide if Cuphead is more adorable than it is difficult, or more difficult than it is adorable. Either way, this platformer with visuals based on cartoons from the 1930s is like no other game ever made. It draws you in with its amazing look, and then keeps you hooked with incredibly challenging and addictive gameplay. You might think having another player to help would make Cuphead easier, but it does not. It only gives you someone else to blame for your many failures. Available on: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Microsoft Windows, macOS, Macintosh operating systems Overcooked 2 (2018) Imagine an enjoyable version of the busiest back-of-house restaurant job you have ever held. That’s Overcooked 2. While it is possible to play Overcooked 2 online, it’s much more fun to have someone next to you to yell at. And there will be so much yelling as you and your partner frantically try to complete meals to send out of your kitchen to defeat the evil unbread [sic] horde.

"Between the lines, Morrison's plan has coal on the way out, with the future bright","https://theconversation.com/between-the-lines-morrisons-plan-has-coal-on-the-way-out-with-the-future-bright-170643","","['John Quiggin', ' Professor', ' School of Economics', ' The University of Queensland']","","","Masmikha/ShutterstockThe most striking feature of Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s long-term emissions reduction plan outlined on Tuesday is not the long-telegraphed commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050, or the promise of a A$20 billion clean energy program (around 0.2% of national income annually). It is the announcement of a technology target which is entirely outside the government’s control: solar photovoltaic electricity at a cost of A$15 a megawatt-hour ($/MWh). That price translates to 1.5 cents per kilowatt hour (c/kWh), a tiny fraction of the 20 to 30 (c/kWh) currently being paid by Australian households. Most of the price households pay consists of charges for transmission, distribution and retail services. The Australian government cannot deliver (or even significantly obstruct) this target, any more than Australia, acting alone, can much effect the global climate. But it’s easy to see Mr Morrison is on safe ground in setting ultra-cheap solar photovoltaic electricity as his goal. That’s because the world is almost there. Long-term solar power supply contracts in many countries are being settled at prices of less than A$0.02 c/kWh and prices are continuing to fall. Reductions in the cost of solar modules, inverters and the like are being driven by a massive global industry, with an annual turnover of more than $A200 billion a year, and correspondingly huge research and development budgets. Read more: Morrison's climate plan has 35% 2030 emissions reduction 'projection' but modelling underpinning 2050 target yet to be released The programs announced today might help to accelerate progress a little, but they are part of a massive global effort. Equally critical, and less subject to government control, is the global decline in long-term real interest rates which are now zero or negative, even over terms of 30 years, more than the expected life of a solar plant. A zero real interest rate, combined with near-zero operating costs means a solar plant only needs to generate enough electricity over its lifetime to pay for its initial installation cost. Solar electricity now costs very little Utility-scale solar can now be installed at a cost of less than $A1/watt or $A1,000/kWh. In favourable locations, such as those in most parts of Australia, solar cells can deliver the 2,000 hours of full power per year, over a lifetime of 25 years. That’s 50,000 kWh, implying a cost of A$0.02 c/kWh. We can expect to see such prices appearing in contracts very soon, as the ultra-low cost of capital is factored into calculations of returns. Technological progress will get us the rest of the way to Morrison’s target. This remains about as true even when we take account of the need for energy storage, to ensure electricity generated at the midday supply peak can be shifted to meet the demand peak in the early evening and to meet the much lower night-time need (sometimes called “baseload”). The costs of batteries are declining in the same way as solar cells. Read more: Australia's stumbling, last-minute dash for climate respectability doesn't negate a decade of abject failure What are the implications for the Australian coal industry? It’s already clear new coal-fired power is uneconomic in competition with solar and wind power, and most countries have stopped commissioning new generators. The exceptions, including those in China, reflect the desire of provincial governments to keep capital investment going, rather than a calculation of costs and benefits. But as the price of solar falls, even the existing paid-for plants will become uneconomic, unless the price of coal falls drastically. Brutal arithmetic The arithmetic is brutal. One tonne of high-grade thermal coal is sufficient to generate 2-3 MWh of electricity. In a market where the price is set by competition from solar at A$15/MWh, that would yield revenue A$30-45/tonne, out of which has to come the costs of maintaining and operating an ageing coal-power plant, as well as the cost of mining and shipping the coal. At the moment thermal coal costs in excess of US$180 per tonne. Steel will one day be produced without coal. Shestakov Dmytro/Shutterstock Add to that the fact China is in the process of introducing a carbon price, and it’s clear the achievement of Morrison’s solar electricity price target will spell the end of thermal coal. A similar analysis applies to gas. “Green” hydrogen, produced by cheap electrolysis, could do the same for coking coal, as well as undercutting “blue” hydrogen produced from gas. That won’t happen immediately. In the very short term in places such as China, growth in electricity demand is outpacing installations of solar and wind, pushing coal prices high. And carbon-free steel is some way off. When the global demand for coal does declines, it will be higher-cost and lower-quality producers such as those in Indonesia that will feel it before Australia’s. But the idea Australia will still be exporting significant quantities of coal in 2040 — let alone 2050 — is a fantasy. The broader story delivered by Morrison (and the right one) is a story of optimism. Coal on way out, future bright Instead of the alarmist scenarios of $100 roasts and economic catastrophe still being pushed by opponents of action, we are at a point where we can safely predict we will have more than enough ultra-cheap, pollution-free electricity to power homes, vehicles and most kinds of industry. All that’s needed is the courage to embrace it. It will require more than we have seen from our leaders so far. Read more: The Nationals finally agree to a 2050 net-zero target, but the real decisions on Australia's emissions are happening elsewhere We need to accelerate the transition away from coal-fired electricity and internal combustion vehicles, starting immediately. The internal politics of the LNP might have stopped Morrison from announcing a serious target for emissions reductions by 2030, but there is no reason we couldn’t reduce emissions by 50% or more, while setting a course for a more prosperous and sustainable future.

"Supreme Court directs UP to grant protection to witnesses of Lakhimpur violence","https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-directs-up-to-grant-protection-to-witnesses-of-lakhimpur-violence-329920","","","","New Delhi, October 26 The Supreme Court on Tuesday directed the Uttar Pradesh government to grant protection to the witnesses of the Lakhimpur Kheri violence case in which eight people, including four farmers, were killed during a farmers' protest. A bench headed by Chief justice NV Ramana asked the Uttar Pradesh government, represented by senior advocates Harish Salve and Garima Prasad, to record the statements of other relevant witnesses before judicial magistrates under Section 164 of the CrPC. ""We direct the district judge concerned to entrust the task of recording of evidence under Section 164 of the CrPC to the nearest judicial magistrates available,"" said the bench which also comprised Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli. The bench asked Salve to convey its concerns to forensic labs and experts on preparation of reports on electronic evidence of the incident. The top court, meanwhile, asked the state government to also file its report on two complaints, including the one related to the lynching of a journalist. ""The state is directed to file separate replies in the cases,"" the bench said and fixed the plea for further hearing on November 8. Observing that the probe into the Lakhimpur Kheri violence should not be an ""unending story"", the Supreme Court on October 20 had rapped the government, saying the court was getting the impression that the state police was dragging its feet, and also ordered the protection of witnesses.

The likes of “grandma’s footsteps” and tug of war are turned gory as contestants try to survive long enough to claim a share of the prize. Its viral success has prompted an escalation of a not quite so life-or-death, but decades-long dispute between telecoms giants and big tech over net neutrality. Almost as old as the internet itself, net neutrality is the concept that internet providers should give equal access to all content, regardless of the product or website. The Squid Game’s viral success has prompted an escalation of a decades-long dispute between telecoms giants and big tech over net neutrality. Essentially, the question is: who pays for the internet? Broadband providers cannot charge Netflix more, simply because the 142 million people streaming Squid Game are hogging all the bandwidth. But that could be about to change. South Korean network provider SK Broadband sued Netflix earlier this month, demanding it cough up for delivering Squid Game - the court ordered the parties to agree on a payment, although Netflix is appealing. In the US, net neutrality has been a hot political issue. Hundreds of millions in lobbying fees crossed both sides of the debate as tech and telecoms firms waged war, while internet activists took to the streets to protest, defending the web. And in the UK, current rules face a potential shake-up. As revealed by The Sunday Telegraph in March, Ofcom is reviewing whether regulations should change amid pressure from telecoms companies, to force tech giants to contribute to the tens of billions being spent on broadband upgrades. A call for evidence will close in November. The review is still in its information gathering stage and no decisions have been made. The dispute has heated up, largely spearheaded by Marc Allera, chief executive of EE, who said in March: “We ask ourselves: are current net neutrality laws fit for purpose?” EE argues that, at times, 80 per cent of internet traffic is being driven by just four big tech firms. “You can understand the motivation [from telecoms companies],” says Paul Bernal, a professor of IT law at the University of East Anglia. “They think: ‘hang on, Netflix is making billions out of our infrastructure. It should pay its way.’,” But the logic behind their demands falls flat, he says. When a hit like Squid Game or the next Call of Duty is launched, people buy a better broadband package, boosting revenues for telecoms firms. Forcing Netflix to pay more is like getting paid twice for providing the same service. Still, these network operators believe there are tweaks to net neutrality that regulators may be open to. Ofcom has said it would examine the impact of net neutrality on investment, on new technology such as 5G and gaming, and on zero rating - the process of giving away some services for free. The last area is one that demands more clarity. During the pandemic, mobile networks were under pressure to “zero rate” education websites as students were forced to study from home, despite it not generally being permitted under net neutrality rules. The UK did it anyway, on a de facto basis with websites such as the NHS, and Ofcom did not intervene. In fact, the regulator has always been quite light on “zero rating”, allowing several operators to offer social media apps free traffic that doesn’t count towards users’ data allowance. But telecoms are likely to push for further change. “They want more freedom to have a more commercial relationship with content providers,” says Matthew Howett, founder of consultancy Assembly Research. That could, he says, see “operators striking deals with games makers to prioritise a particular update or traffic”. Broadband insiders say gaming giants should be required to work with networks when they are planning to deliver huge software updates, so these can be managed efficiently - for example, so the next Call of Duty download doesn’t clash with an England match. But tech companies are suspicious, especially after bruising battles in the US. They fear any watering down of net neutrality could cause networks to slow down their services unfairly. And streaming companies argue they already invest heavily in technology that stops their traffic overwhelming mobile and broadband networks. “Netflix invests millions in content delivery networks to get its traffic to you,” says Howett. The real overriding problem, critics say, is that networks have not invested enough in fibre and 5G until now, meaning bottlenecks will continue until the infrastructure catches up with our increasingly online world. After years of trying, UK telecoms have finally got net neutrality back on the agenda, made known by Squid Game . For them to push through even a few tweaks would be toasted as a win.

Read More","2021-10-26 06:37:19","Washington State and Arizona State, two Pac-12 programs rocked by off-the-field developments this season, will try to find themselves on the field at Tempe, Ariz., on Saturday. The Cougars (4-4, 3-2 Pac-12) lost to BYU 21-19 last week at Pullman, Wash., in their first game under Jake Dickert. The former defensive coordinator was elevated to interim head coach after Nick Rolovich and four assistants were fired for not complying with the Washington mandate that all state employees be vaccinated against COVID-19. Arizona State (5-2, 3-1) is under investigation for recruiting violations, and assistant coaches Prentice Gill, Chris Hawkins and Adam Breneman have all been placed on paid leave. The Sun Devils’ bye last week came at an opportune time following a disappointing 35-21 loss at Utah on Oct. 16 after the Arizona State led 21-7 at halftime. Arizona State is healthier than it was for the Utah game. Cornerback Chase Lucas and wide receiver Johnny Wilson are expected to play against Washington State, while safety Evan Fields will be a game-time decision. All are returning from injuries. “We got a lot of guys back,” Sun Devils coach Herm Edwards said. “We’ve lost some pretty good players, especially on the D-line that are gone. That’s just how it goes. Every team has that. That’s what you deal with.” Lucas, a senior who has played in 46 games since 2017, missed games on Sept. 25 and Oct. 16. Wilson, a redshirt freshman, has missed each of the past three games. Fields, a senior, sat out two of the past three games. Washington State and Arizona State each lost to both BYU and Utah, although the Cougars’ setbacks were by closer margins. Washington State’s 24-13 loss at Utah occurred last month. The Cougars’ three-game winning streak was snapped in the loss to BYU despite three rushing touchdowns by Max Borghi. Jayden de Laura, a sophomore recruited from Honolulu by Rolovich, completed 26 of 37 passes for 257 yards, but he didn’t throw a touchdown pass and had an interception. “It’s a little bit learning on the fly,” Dickert said of his first experience as a head coach. “I felt it was really smooth. For the most part we operated as a staff.” Dickert must now prepare for an Arizona State offense that is balanced with dual-threat quarterback Jayden Daniels and running backs Rachaad White (477 yards rushing and nine touchdowns), Daniyel Ngata (253 yards) and DeaMonte Trayanum (215 yards). Arizona State is tied for seventh in the nation with 22 rushing touchdowns. –Field Level Media","","nationalpost"

"Are Black women being failed by domestic abuse services?","https://metro.co.uk/2021/10/26/are-black-women-being-failed-by-domestic-abuse-services-15470817/","['Lifestyle', 'Domestic abuse', 'Race', 'Racism']","['Ella Glover']","","'We don't fit the mould of the ""ideal victim""'.","‘I felt like I didn’t fit the profile of what a victim should look like’ (Picture: Getty) Black survivors of domestic violence are being treated unequally by police and are unable to access the same level of specialist help. According to Refuge, the UK’s largest single provider of domestic abuse services, Black women are less likely to be referred by police to Refuge for support.   Between March 2020 and June 2021, Black women were 14% less likely to be referred to Refuge for support by police than white survivors of domestic abuse.   However, Refuge also found that Black survivors were 3% more likely to report the abuse they experienced to the police than white survivors of domestic abuse, over the same period.   Erica Osakwe has experienced first-hand the institutional failings when dealing with Black victims of domestic abuse. After years of suffering emotional and physical abuse, Erica decided to go to the police. ‘Like a lot of people, I thought there was nothing that the police could do for me,’ she tells Metro.co.uk. ‘I didn’t feel comfortable with the idea of coming forward at all, because I was online reading other people’s stories and hearing that people got nothing out of it, that it was emotionally traumatising. It put me off.’ Unfortunately, Erica’s fears were confirmed when she arrived at the station with her friend, a white woman.  ‘Although we had spoken on the phone, the police didn’t know what I looked like,’ she says. ‘I told the police officer that we wanted to discuss assault and they immediately assumed that it was my friend who had come to report a crime. ‘I already felt like I didn’t fit the profile of what a victim should look like. It was not the start I expected.’  This phenomenon is down to what Evie Muir, a domestic abuse specialist, calls the ‘ideal victim’ narrative. Evie tells Metro.co.uk: ‘When I’m delivering training on Black people’s experiences of abuse, I ask participants to think of a survivor of abuse. ‘It’s likely that the first image to pop into their head will have instantly been a white, cisgender, heterosexual woman who may be covered in bruises, or be cowering under a fist. ‘This public story is regurgitated in the news (which victims get the most airtime?), on television and even in the publicity distributed by domestic abuse sectors and charities. ‘This tells us, wrongly, that domestic abuse mostly happens to young, white, cisgender, heterosexual women, that it’s mostly physical, and that the abuse must be visible.’ More: RacismInterracial couple who split as teens because parents disapproved get back together at 60Woman kicked out of bar starts racist rant at security guards‘I was right to feel afraid': People of colour are terrified amid the rise in hate crimes Obviously, this poses a problem for Black survivors. ‘When a Black survivor presents themselves to the police with barely-visible bruises due to the pigmentation of their skin, or tells of how their partner expects them to always be up for sex, and types of sex they aren’t comfortable with because of the ways Black people are fetishised, or how the emotional abuse caused by microaggressions from their non-Black partner and family is becoming unbearable, police won’t recognise this as abuse – because it doesn’t fit the public story,’ Muir continues. ‘It’s because the survivor doesn’t fit the mould of the “ideal victim”; it’s a story so powerful that it dictates who is seen as a victim and who is seen as worthy of support.’  After reporting her experience of abuse, Erica was told to leave the station and file her report online, because of the restrictions of the pandemic. But when another officer saw that she was noticeably distraught outside the station, she was welcomed back in and asked to recount her story. ‘It took around five hours and then, after that day, if I’m being honest, I did not hear a single piece of information about that investigation for about five to six months,’ she says.  During this time, having not been referred to any specialist domestic abuse services, Erica says she spiralled into a period of depression. ‘I had to start counselling, I was on the waiting list for therapy and I was dealing with PTSD as well,’ she explains. ‘Everything was quite heightened due to the uncertainty of the investigation and the uncertainty of my wellbeing. ‘I was kind of left with no support, so I was just there on my own trying to deal with everything.  ‘I was quite paranoid all the time always wondering if this person was going to find me or confront me. ‘It was a very, very tough period of time.’ For domestic abuse specialist Evie Muir, Black women not being referred to specialist domestic violence services is not only a police failure, but a failure of the support sector more generally. ‘When we look at why Black women are less likely to be referred to specialist services by police, it can be very misleading for it to be depicted that there is an abundance of specialist services that the police aren’t utilising,’ she says. ‘The services themselves hardly exist – it’s a ripple effect.  ‘Specialist services are few and far between, and the ones that do exist are underfunded, at over-capacity and not necessarily undeserving of critique.’ After around six months of waiting, Erica heard that the police filed her report incorrectly and there was nothing they could do for her, thanks in part to the six-month deadline for victims to report domestic abuse. Erica began campaigning for a change in the law to allow survivors more time to come forward with reports of abuse.  ‘I was determined to make sure that no one experiences that sort of pain again,’ she says. ‘I needed to do something about it.’ ‘I started a government petition that was running for six months, ironically.  She got 64,000 signatures, less than the 100,000 that was needed for a debate, but the petition was still considered for discussion anyway, which Erica says was ‘amazing’ to see. ‘Since then, I’ve been working alongside Refuge, Women’s Aid, and the Centre for Women’s Justice trying to push this motion on extending the time limit so that people have more time to process abuse and assault, come to terms with it, and then have the courage to come forward,’ she adds. Breaking down the barriers preventing Black survivors from getting the help they need and deserve is far from simple, and sticking plaster methods are far from ideal. Evie Muir explains: ‘Unconscious bias training might just scratch the surface of topics like privilege and accountability, but it’s certainly not going to make a Black survivor any safer. ‘It doesn’t change the prison industrial complex, it doesn’t change prosecution and sentencing outcomes, it doesn’t the way services are funded, and it doesn’t change support provisions on the ground. ‘Any training that does take place however needs to be on Black experiences of domestic abuse.  ‘For example, Sistah Space is currently campaigning for Valerie’s Law to be instated, which would see the police and mainstream services receiving compulsory training on African and Caribbean heritage experiences of abuse, delivered by Black survivors and Black practitioners.’ More: RacismInterracial couple who split as teens because parents disapproved get back together at 60Woman kicked out of bar starts racist rant at security guards‘I was right to feel afraid': People of colour are terrified amid the rise in hate crimes Ruth Davison, CEO of Refuge, said: ‘Time and again, Refuge hears about the additional barriers Black women face when coming forward to report domestic abuse.  ‘We know that Black women’s concerns are less likely to be taken seriously and this new data from Refuge shows that they’re also less likely to be referred for the lifesaving support that our organisation provides.  ‘What message does that send to Black women experiencing domestic abuse? ‘We must ensure all agencies work better to protect Black women and ensure they are able to access support swiftly and easily.’ Do you have a story to share?

During this time, having not been referred to any specialist domestic abuse services, Erica says she spiralled into a period of depression. ‘I had to start counselling, I was on the waiting list for therapy and I was dealing with PTSD as well,’ she explains. ‘Everything was quite heightened due to the uncertainty of the investigation and the uncertainty of my wellbeing. ‘I was kind of left with no support, so I was just there on my own trying to deal with everything. ‘I was quite paranoid all the time always wondering if this person was going to find me or confront me. ‘It was a very, very tough period of time.’ For domestic abuse specialist Evie Muir, Black women not being referred to specialist domestic violence services is not only a police failure, but a failure of the support sector more generally. ‘When we look at why Black women are less likely to be referred to specialist services by police, it can be very misleading for it to be depicted that there is an abundance of specialist services that the police aren’t utilising,’ she says. ‘The services themselves hardly exist – it’s a ripple effect. ‘Specialist services are few and far between, and the ones that do exist are underfunded, at over-capacity and not necessarily undeserving of critique.’ After around six months of waiting, Erica heard that the police filed her report incorrectly and there was nothing they could do for her, thanks in part to the six-month deadline for victims to report domestic abuse. Erica began campaigning for a change in the law to allow survivors more time to come forward with reports of abuse. ‘I was determined to make sure that no one experiences that sort of pain again,’ she says. ‘I needed to do something about it.’ ‘I started a government petition that was running for six months, ironically. She got 64,000 signatures, less than the 100,000 that was needed for a debate, but the petition was still considered for discussion anyway, which Erica says was ‘amazing’ to see. ‘Since then, I’ve been working alongside Refuge, Women’s Aid, and the Centre for Women’s Justice trying to push this motion on extending the time limit so that people have more time to process abuse and assault, come to terms with it, and then have the courage to come forward,’ she adds. Breaking down the barriers preventing Black survivors from getting the help they need and deserve is far from simple, and sticking plaster methods are far from ideal. Evie Muir explains: ‘Unconscious bias training might just scratch the surface of topics like privilege and accountability, but it’s certainly not going to make a Black survivor any safer. ‘It doesn’t change the prison industrial complex, it doesn’t change prosecution and sentencing outcomes, it doesn’t the way services are funded, and it doesn’t change support provisions on the ground. ‘Any training that does take place however needs to be on Black experiences of domestic abuse. ‘For example, Sistah Space is currently campaigning for Valerie’s Law to be instated, which would see the police and mainstream services receiving compulsory training on African and Caribbean heritage experiences of abuse, delivered by Black survivors and Black practitioners.’ Interracial couple who split as teens because parents disapproved get back together at 60 Woman kicked out of bar starts racist rant at security guards ‘I was right to feel afraid': People of colour are terrified amid the rise in hate crimes A-level textbook withdrawn over 'horrifying' question about Native Americans Ruth Davison, CEO of Refuge, said: ‘Time and again, Refuge hears about the additional barriers Black women face when coming forward to report domestic abuse. ‘We know that Black women’s concerns are less likely to be taken seriously and this new data from Refuge shows that they’re also less likely to be referred for the lifesaving support that our organisation provides. ‘What message does that send to Black women experiencing domestic abuse? ‘We must ensure all agencies work better to protect Black women and ensure they are able to access support swiftly and easily.’ Do you have a story to share?

The changes will mean that about 40% of all New Zealand workers will need to get fully vaccinated against the coronavirus or risk losing their jobs, up from about 15% previously. Speaking with reporters, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said she didn’t believe the new rules were an overreach of government power. “This requirement means staff and customers are treated equally and it will play a big part in helping to minimize the spread of the virus in the highest-risk venues by reducing the potential for COVID to enter the business in the first place,” Ardern said. Workers who had previously been told they needed to get their shots included teachers and health care professionals. Tuesday's announcement came just a few days after the government set a target of getting 90% of people aged 12 and over fully vaccinated in order to end the cycle of lockdowns. Auckland, the largest city, has been in lockdown for more than two months after an outbreak of the delta variant. As part of its plan to end lockdowns, New Zealand will also require people visiting high-traffic businesses to show vaccine passports to prove they've had their shots. The conservative opposition National Party said there was no need for restrictions such as vaccine passports once vaccination targets were met. “Some businesses will choose to require proof of vaccination. Others will not,” said opposition leader Judith Collins in a statement.

Dover became the NBL’s first female Aboriginal referee, making her debut in the league’s Indigenous round. The proud Yugambeh woman will move to New York where she will work with legendary NBA referee Monty McCutchen as an NBA trainee referee. Dover said she is hopeful it won’t take her too long to get on the NBA court. “I’m really excited for the challenge. I know there’s a whole lot of work ahead of me to get to the actual NBA court. But yeah, I’m just excited for what the journey is going to provide,” she said. “I’m not a super patient person. So, hopefully quick enough I’ll be on the NBA court soon.” Growing up in Townsville, Dover started off her career as a player but became frustrated with the sport as she began to realise she didn’t have a future as a professional athlete. Jacqui Dover is set to join the NBA’s trainee referees program. Credit: Getty Instead of walking away from basketball completely, Dover decided to pick up a whistle. Dover began officiating locally in Townsville late in 2014 and joined the Queensland Basketball League less than 12 months later. By the end of 2019, she progressed into the WNBL before joining the men’s NBL last year. Now, Dover will join the long list of NBA identities who have used the NBL as a springboard to the US. “When you’re so obsessed with basketball and on that playing path, every kid’s dream is to be in the NBA or WNBA,” she said. “So to realise that opportunity from an officiating point of view is pretty exciting.” Dover is hopeful her move to the NBA will encourage more kids – especially Indigenous children – to give refereeing a go. “Hopefully, it’s just the same ripple effect down the chain,” she said. “Hopefully we see new First Nations officials picking up a whistle and getting into officiating and also seeing that there’s that opportunity outside of playing.” Dover also hopes she can inspire kids to stay in the basketball system, even if they aren’t able to make it as a player. “If anyone can pick up the whistle that comes from playing or coaching and that it’s just going to make the game better,” she said. “It’s just showing that that’s an opportunity. I know growing up I never thought that I’d be a referee. So highlighting that opportunity that’s there for everybody.” Dover will continue as a NBL referee for the 2021-22 season before she moves to the US. Sports news, results and expert commentary.

"Stocks rally in Asia, China property sector worries dampen sentiment","https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/stocks-rally-asia-china-property-sector-worries-dampen-sentiment-2269212","","","","","","2021-10-26 06:24:25","HONG KONG : Asian stocks largely rallied on Tuesday, following Wall Street's record highs overnight, though fresh worries about China's property sector weighed on investors' sentiments. Europe and U.S. markets look set to keep the upward momentum as FTSE futures and E-mini futures for the S&P 500 index were up 0.06per cent and 0.24per cent respectively at 0531 GMT. MSCI’s gauge of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan rose 0.15per cent and briefly touched its highest in six weeks on Tuesday, after gaining throughout October. The Asian regional benchmark however is down about 11per cent from its February high compared to the MSCI world equity index which is in sight of its record high hit six weeks ago. ""Equity prices are likely to be driven by technical positioning this week, as trade enters the final week of the month,"" said Anderson Alves, an equities trader at global online trading platform ActivTrades. Japan's benchmark Nikkei average gained nearly 1.8per cent, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 closed 0.03per cent higher. The CSI300 index inched 0.05per cent higher led by information technology stocks, but the Hong Kong benchmark Hang Seng Index eased 0.4per cent. China property stocks extended their losses in the afternoon sessions as another developer, Modern land, defaulted on a payment, adding to worries about spiralling effects of the debt crisis at China Evergrande Group. An index of Hong Kong-listed mainland property firms dropped 4.7per cent and the mainland's CSI 300 Real Estate Index was down 2.4per cent. China has said it will roll out a pilot real estate tax in some regions, adding to existing investor concerns about real estate in the mainland. Edison Pun, Senior Market Analyst at Saxo Markets in Hong Kong noted that markets remained on a strong trend, having begun digesting the prospect that the U.S. Federal Reserve will begin tapering its monetary stimulus in November. ""However, we need to watch whether it will put on extra pressure on the Chinese property market when the property tax is rolled out. It could hurt consumption in the end if we are seeing an overall downturn in Chinese property prices,"" he said. A large proportion of S&P 500 companies are due to report results this week, including technology heavyweights Facebook, Apple Inc, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet, which have been the drivers of the market rally this year. ""Of the S&P 500 firms that have reported this season, the net surprise on earnings has been 13per cent. So it is easy to understand the optimism percolating through risk appetite despite inflation fears,"" said ANZ Research in a note. ""The economy remains very strong. We expect the recovery will re-accelerate once bottlenecks and COVID concerns subside."" The European Central Bank and Bank of Japan are both set to hold monetary policy meetings on Thursday, although neither are expected to take major action on interest rates. The Dow Jones Industrials and S&P 500 closed at record highs on Monday. Tesla, which jumped 12.66per cent and breached US$1 trillion in market capitalisation, also provided the biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes were steady at 1.6397per cent off last week's five month top of 1.7per cent as uncertainty about when the Federal Reserve would raise rates to curb rising inflation weighed on market sentiment. The dollar rose 0.1per cent on Tuesday, recovering from a near one-month trough hit during the previous session. Already nudging multi-year highs, oil prices rose marginally in a market gripped by tight global supply and strengthening fuel demand in the United States and beyond. Brent crude futures pared earlier losses to stand atUS$86.11 a barrel, up 0.14per cent, while the U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures edged 0.01per cent higher to US$83.76 a barrel. Spot gold was down nearly 0.2per cent to around US$1,804 per ounce. (Reporting by Kane Wu; additional reporting by Alun John; Editing by Sam Holmes & Simon Cameron-Moore)","","channelnewsasia"

"Former South Korean president dies at 88","https://www.newcastleherald.com.au/story/7485654/former-south-korean-president-dies-at-88/?src=rss","","['Sangmi Cha and Josh Smith']","","","","2021-10-26 06:14:05","South Korean former president Roh Tae-woo, a decorated war veteran who played a pivotal but controversial role in the transition to democratic elections from rule by authoritarian leaders, has died, a Seoul hospital confirmed. The 88-year-old died on Tuesday, a Seoul National University Hospital official said, without citing the cause of death. Roh had been in poor health since 2002 when he received surgery for prostate cancer and he was repeatedly hospitalised in recent years. In the space of a few decades, Roh went from military coup conspirator to South Korea's first popularly elected president, before ending his political career in ignominy with a jail sentence for treason and corruption. ""I now feel limitlessly shameful for being a former president,"" Roh told the public in a tearful televised apology in 1995 for secretly amassing a $US654 million slush fund while in office. Roh was born on December 4, 1932, the son of a poor farmer in Talsong County, near the southeastern city of Taegu. He was educated first at the Korean Military Academy in Seoul and later attended a psychological warfare course at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Roh began his military career during the 1950-1953 Korean War and was the commander of a combat unit in the Vietnam War. When former strong man Park Chung-hee was assassinated in 1979, Roh supported his former military classmate Chun Doo-hwan in a military coup that installed the latter in the presidential Blue House. Roh was rewarded with a series of government posts. However, when Chun named Roh as his successor ahead of the 1987 presidential elections there was a public outcry, with large pro-democracy rallies held in Seoul and other cities. In response and to distance himself from Chun, Roh issued the ""June 29 Declaration"", announcing significant political reforms including the direct election of the president. He campaigned as a man of the people. In office, he discarded the title ""excellency"" and opened up the Blue House to the public. Roh had success as a global statesman, scoring a diplomatic breakthrough with his ""Nordpolitik"" drive to establish formal ties with Cold War-era enemies Russia and China. As the original driving force behind the 1988 Seoul Olympics, Roh helped South Korea forge a new international identity. He also ushered the country into the United Nations in 1991. But his term in office was blighted by street protests and economic instability. Two weeks before he left the Blue House he was voted the worst politician in South Korea in a public survey. Just a few years later he was sentenced to 22-1/2 years in prison for his role in the 1979 coup and the 1980 Gwangju army massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators, as well as massive corruption. Grim-faced and wearing prison pyjamas, Roh faced court alongside Chun, who received a commuted death sentence. Local media dubbed it the ""trial of the century"" as it dug up many of the dirtiest secrets from South Korea's era of strongman rule. Referring to the massacre, the judges' verdict accused Chun and Ro of ""putting down popular resistance to clear the way for their rise to power"". Female relatives of the Kwangju victims, dressed in traditional mourning white, attacked Roh's son, Jae-hun, as he left the court, shouting ""Kill the murderer's son"". Both men were pardoned by President Kim Young-sam and freed from jail in 1997. In 2013, Roh's family helped him pay off the last of the money he illegally amassed during his presidency.

"Above 80% of Indians live in districts vulnerable to climate risks: Report","https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/above-80-of-indians-live-in-districts-vulnerable-to-climate-risks-report-121102600434_1.html","","","","Dhemaji and Nagaon in Assam, Khammam in Telangana, Chennai in Tamil Nadu, Gajapati in Odisha, Vizianagaram in Andhra Pradesh and Sangli in Maharashtra among India's most climate vulnerable districts","","2021-10-26 06:09:09","More than 80 per cent Indians live in districts vulnerable to climate risks, while Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Bihar are states which are most vulnerable to extreme climate events such as floods, droughts and cyclones in India, said the Climate Vulnerability Index released by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) on Monday. The report has cited Dhemaji and Nagaon in Assam, Chennai in Tamil Nadu, Khammam in Telangana, Gajapati in Odisha, Vizianagaram in Andhra Pradesh and Sangli in Maharashtra among India’s most climate vulnerable districts. Overall, 27 Indian states and Union Territories are vulnerable to extreme climate events which often disrupt the local economy and displace weaker communities, it said. The study, supported by the India Climate Collaborative and Edelgive Foundation, further highlighted that 463 out of 640 districts in India are vulnerable to extreme floods, droughts and cyclones. More than 45 per cent of these districts have undergone unsustainable landscape and infrastructure changes. Further, 183 hotspot districts are highly vulnerable to more than one extreme climate event. The CEEW study also found that more than 60 per cent of Indian districts have medium to low adaptive capacity. The CEEW study also highlighted that states in North East are more vulnerable to floods, while the ones in the south and central are most vulnerable to extreme droughts. Further, 59 and 41 per cent of the total districts in the eastern and western states, respectively, are highly vulnerable to extreme cyclones. Only 63 per cent of Indian districts have a District Disaster Management Plan (DDMP). “While these plans need to be updated every year, only 32 per cent of them had updated plans until 2019. Highly vulnerable, states like Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Karnataka and Gujarat have improved their respective DDMPs and climate-proofed critical infrastructures in the recent years,” it said. Abinash Mohanty, programme lead, CEEW, and lead author of the study, said, “The frequency and intensity of extreme climate events in India have increased by almost 200 per cent since 2005. Our policymakers, industry leaders and citizens must use the district-level analysis to make effective risk-informed decisions. India must create a new Climate Risk Commission to coordinate the environmental de-risking mission.” The CEEW study recommended that restoration of climate-sensitive landscapes will act as natural shock absorbers against extreme climate events. Further, integration of climate risk profiling with infrastructure planning is imperative for protecting the existing and planned infrastructure projects. The findings are relevant since India is considered the seventh most vulnerable country across the globe, according to the Climate Risk Index by Germanwatch. The CEEW study is the first one to assess the vulnerability of India’s districts against extreme climate events. Arunabha Ghosh, chief executive officer of CEEW, said, “Combating the rising frequency and scale of extreme climate events is fiscally draining for developing countries such as India. At COP-26, developed countries must regain trust by delivering the $100 billion promised since 2009 and commit to stepping up climate finance over the coming decade. Further, India must collaborate with other countries to create a Global Resilience Reserve Fund, which could act as insurance against climate shocks.”","","business-standard"

KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 26 — Malaysia fully supports the decision made by the Asean Chair, Brunei, on the issue of representation from Myanmar at the 38th and 39th Asean Summit and Related Summits, said Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob.He said this in his Twitter posting regarding Malaysia’s statement at the three-day summits beginning Tuesday under the chairmanship of Brunei via virtual conference.During the Asean foreign ministers’ online meeting on Oct 15, the regional bloc took a bold step to exclude Myanmar’s junta from the summits and also shot down the request by Myanmar’s shadow government, the National Unity Government (NUJ), to join the summits.The grouping instead decided to invite a non-political representative to represent the country.Since the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi was overthrown by the junta on Feb 1, there has been internal unrest in Myanmar with nearly 1,000 civilians killed by security forces.During the 38th Asean Summit, Ismail Sabri also touched on the Covid-19 pandemic, urging Asean to enhance cooperation with like-minded countries and relevant international organisations towards ensuring that vaccines were affordable, accessible and equitably shared for all as well as prioritising engagement in health diplomacy through greater collaboration.Meanwhile, he said the High Level Task Force (HLTF) on the Asean Community Post-2025 Vision is to prepare Asean to be more agile in dealing with challenges and adapting to changes.He pointed out that the regional grouping should identify measures to make way for Asean to work more efficiently and effectively with optimum utilisation of resources.“Include opportunities derived from the experience and lessons from the pandemic,” he said.Meanwhile, on the 39th Asean Summit, he said Malaysia urged Myanmar to continue with efforts in delivering its commitment to begin and ensure effective repatriation of the refugees and protect the human rights of the returnees.He stated that Malaysia also firmly holds that matters relating to the South China Sea must be resolved peacefully and constructively, in accordance with universally recognised principles of international law, including the United Nations Convention on The Law of The Sea (UNCLOS).Malaysia also remains strongly committed to ratifying the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) by the end of this year as it will help expedite regional recovery as well as resilience. — Bernama","2021-10-26 06:09:07","","","malaymail"

(Theratechnologies) (TSX: TH) (NASDAQ: THTX), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies, is pleased to announce that it has reached an agreement with the Italian Medicines Agency, AIFA, for the reimbursement of Trogarzo ® for eligible people aged 18 and older living with multi-drug resistant (MDR) HIV-1. “This agreement is an important milestone for Trogarzo ® and for HIV-1 patients in Italy,” said Conor Walshe, General Manager, Europe. “Italy is the first country with a universal healthcare plan that has approved the formal reimbursement of Trogarzo ® for all patients in need. We expect to launch Trogarzo ® in Italy during the current quarter and look forward to its wider commercial availability in Europe over the coming months.” Trogarzo ® was first approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2018 and was the first long-acting agent approved for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in heavily treatment-experienced adults with MDR HIV-1 infection failing their current antiretroviral regimen. Trogarzo ® was approved by the European Medical Agency (EMA) in September 2019 for the treatment of adults infected with MDR HIV-1 for whom it is otherwise not possible to construct a suppressive antiviral regimen and is also commercially available in Germany. A number of patients are also being treated with Trogarzo ® in other European countries through early access programs. Theratechnologies plans to launch Trogarzo ® on a country-by-country basis across Europe as it gains reimbursement in each individual country. In addition, the Company received regulatory approval in Israel for Trogarzo ® and is working to secure pricing and reimbursement. About Trogarzo ® 1 Trogarzo ® a humanized monoclonal antibody of immunoglobulin G type 4 (IgG4), is a CD4 domain 2-directed HIV-1 inhibitor. Trogarzo ® blocks HIV-1 from infecting CD4+ T cells by binding to domain 2 of CD4 and interfering with the post-attachment steps required for the entry of HIV-1 virus particles into host cells and preventing the viral transmission that occurs via cell-cell fusion. Trogarzo ® is administered every 2 weeks via intravenous infusion. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were rash (9.2%), diarrhea (3.9%), dizziness (3.9%), headache (3.9%), nausea (3.9%), fatigue (2.0%) and vomiting (2.0%).

When the NFL GOAT switched over from the Patriots to the Buccaneers last year, many people speculated whether he would really be able to find success under a head coach whose name wasn’t Bill Belichick. Well, Brady proved them wrong and then some. Not only did he play sensational (top five in passing yards and touchdowns), he also won the Buccaneers a Super Bowl finishing as the Super Bowl MVP. This year, he’s exceeding expectations too as he’s first in the league in passing yards (2,275) and touchdowns (21) with only three interceptions. He also recently became the first player to throw 600 career touchdowns.

LFG pic.twitter.com/eEBQxVo5GS — Jill Beckman (@_jillbeckman) July 23, 2021 That mentality almost led Brady to taking up a different jersey number with the Buccaneers. It might feel like a lifetime ago now, but there was a time when Chris Godwin used to wear the #12 that Brady had donned for 20 years with New England. After the deal had gone through, GM Jason Licht wanted to make sure that Brady knew Godwin was already wearing the number that he’d been used to having for so long. “Hey, there’s one other thing here,” Licht told Brady. “It’s a small thing, but maybe a big thing. We have a No 12 on our team and he’s pretty good – Chris Godwin. What are you thinking about that?” Brady isn’t the kind of person to demand anything outright from a teammate in terms of his own desires, so his response was much more diplomatic, and yet, at the same time it showed how competitive he truly is. “Oh, he’s a great player,” Brady answered back. “I’m not going to take his number. I don’t care about that. You know what number I’m thinking of? I’m thinking of taking maybe No 7. Is that available?” The number was certainly available but Licht didn’t understand why Brady wanted seven. “It is,” Licht replied back. “Why do you want that number?” The answer Brady gave is something you can only expect from the legend. “I want that seventh ring,” Brady calmly answered. That attitude, and that mindset, to always be on the look out for a championship is what enabled Brady and the Bucs to never give up. They got off to a shaky start, and 13 weeks in, they were sitting at 7-5 looking nothing like a Super Bowl contender. Brady and Arians would then have what is now a storied phone call where they dissected the offense to fit both Brady’s playstyle and Arians’ scheme. The result was an undefeated run all the way to the Super Bowl.

"Is the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion pack worth it? - CNET","https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/is-the-nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-worth-it/#ftag=CADf328eec","","['Mark Serrels']","","Commentary: The answer isn't as straight forward as you think...","","2021-10-26 05:51:00","Nintendo It was March 1997. I was 15 years old. I remember it like it was yesterday. I collected my pocket money, hard earned savings from a gruelling paper run and some change I scooped up between the cushions of my parents sofa. I walked nervously to the counter at a Comet retail store in Glasgow, Scotland and laid down a ludicrous £350+ on a brand new Nintendo 64 and two games, Super Mario 64 and Pilotwings 64. Get the CNET Culture newsletter Explore movies, games, superheroes and more with CNET Culture. Delivered Tuesdays and Fridays. The Nintendo 64 had just launched and it cost me everything I owned on this earth. It sent me to the cleaners. Hilariously, just two months later in May, Nintendo announced a £100 price cut. I was heartbroken. It takes you back! Yvonne Hemsey, Getty Images If you'd told me then that 25 years later it would be possible to play Super Mario 64, alongside a library of classics for the piddling price of $5 per month, I have no idea how I would have reacted. Violently? Possibly. Most likely I'd have collapsed into a pathetic foetal ball, shedding real, visceral tears for the exorbitant amount of money I'd just poured down the drain. What a time to be alive. On Tuesday in the glorious year 2021, Nintendo fans can easily access the glorious past for next to nothing. In September 2018, Nintendo launched Nintendo Switch Online, a service that, like Xbox Live or PlayStation Plus, allowed users to play games like Fortnite or Mario Kart 8 online. In addition to the ability to play current games online it provided access to a host of retro NES and SNES games, all for the fairly low price of $20 per year. As of Tuesday, Nintendo has expanded that offering. Now you can subscribe to an Online Expansion Pack to the online service which gives you additional access to a selection of Nintendo 64 and Sega Mega Drive games (alongside -- bizarrely -- new DLC for Animal Crossing). The catch? The service costs more. A significant amount more. Instead of $20 for an annual subscription to the service, the expanded package costs $50 collectively per year. The initial offering of Nintendo 64 games. Nintendo Is it ""worth it""? That's a loaded question and I don't even know where to start. If you'd have asked 15 year old me, in line at Comet to lay down his life savings for a Nintendo 64 and two -- just two -- video games, he'd have snatched that deal with all the power his spindly adolescent arms could muster. But when I asked on Twitter if the Expansion Pack was unfairly priced, people went buckwild . Do people really think the N64 and Mega Drive expansion stuff is unfairly priced? — Mark Serrels (@Serrels) October 26, 2021 The broad consensus, in my Twitter mentions at least, was an additional $30 for access to a rotating cast of N64 and Mega Drive games was much too much. Many complained about the additional cost, or compared it to the value of competing services like Xbox Game Pass or PlayStation Plus. Some took issue with the quality of the games available and wondered how regularly Nintendo would add new titles. All fair points. For me, the ability to easily access a broad library of games I love, across multiple retro platforms, for what amounts to less than $5 a month makes total financial sense. The ability to play online on games like Splatoon 3 when it finally arrives is a bonus. But value is subjective. One reply stood out to me. I get *why* people think it is overpriced but I also think the way people perceive the value of entertainment products is fundamentally broken — James O'Connor (@Jickle) October 26, 2021 Particularly this point: ""the way people perceive the value of entertainment products is fundamentally broken"". I'd go one layer deeper. I'd argue the way people perceive video games specifically is completely and utterly broken. Beyond repair. Right now we're all over the shop. On Xbox Game Pass we have access to entire library of cutting edge video games for $15 a month. Yet one single video game not available on Game Pass could potentially set you back $60. Then we have the question of the games themselves. Smaller scale indie games like, say, the newly released Inscryption on PC, are expected to be cheaper by default than AAA productions like Deathloop on PS5. Why? All the Mega Drive games available on Nintendo Online at launch. Nintendo Should video games really cost more because they cost more to produce? Nobody pays more money to see the latest Marvel movie at the cinema because it has a bigger budget than an Oscar-winning indie flick like Nomadland, so why do the same with video games? Consider major titles like Fortnite and Apex Legends that you can literally play for free and you have a smorgasbord of confusion. In this wild environment where anything goes, who's to say what individual video games are worth? It's complete chaos. By most measures, $50 for 12 months of access to dozens of rotating classic video games should represent value for money. Is this package not valuable because the games are old? The Nintendo Online Expansion pack is a weird, messy package dropped into a rapidly evolving marketplace where the rules and concepts of ""value"" are constantly in shift or -- worse -- contradicting one another. Is the Nintendo Online Expansion unfairly priced? If you think so, then yes. Is it also an incredible deal that gives you access to a host of classic video games? Also yes. It exists at every point of the value spectrum because in video games the rules of value don't make sense. The same people who balk at paying an extra $30 dollars for classic video games might easily fork out the same amount on Fortnite skins. And that's okay. Your mileage will vary. Are you the type of person who'll play Mario 64 for 10 minutes then never use the service again? Maybe this isn't for you. Maybe you'll spend the next month replaying Ocarina of Time in its entirety. If so, this is the best money you'll ever spend. Me? I'll happily fork out some extra cash. The 15 year old that once queued up at Comet to drop his life savings on a Nintendo 64 is happy -- and furious -- at the exact same time.

Five of the Ducks’ seven games have been decided by a touchdown or less, including three in a row. The fact that Oregon has won four of those five close games has the Ducks in the top 10. Oregon (6-1, 3-1 Pac-12) overcame a 14-point deficit, almost blew a 17-point lead and needed a DJ James interception with 51 seconds to play to finish a 34-31 win over UCLA at the Rose Bowl last Saturday. The Ducks host Colorado Saturday afternoon in Eugene, Ore., perhaps hoping for a less stressful afternoon of football. But at the very least, head coach Mario Cristobal likes the type of team he has. “This team, its leaders, its players, they’re a special, special bunch,” Cristobal said via the school’s athletic website. “They’re just resilient. They just keep coming. They truly believe there’s no play, no circumstance, no bad call, no injury we can’t overcome.” During the game, the Ducks lost offensive lineman Jackson Powers-Johnson, defensive lineman Mase Funa and defensive back Dontae Manning to injuries. Powers-Johnson could miss a few weeks, but Funa and Manning are expected back to play the Buffaloes (2-5, 1-3 Pac-12). Other hobbled Ducks include starting center Alex Forsyth, who appears closer to a return from a back injury. But the Ducks showed the strength of their level of talent and roster depth in continuing to win and carry the hopes of the Pac-12 for the College Football Playoff. Travis Dye, now the lead running back, had only 35 rushing yards but scored four touchdowns in the win over the Bruins. Defensive end Kayvon Thibodeaux had two sacks and numerous quarterback hurries against the Bruins, continuing his strong play this season. “We love games like that, being able to be out there playing to the last whistle. It was exciting. There was so much going on. I love it,” Thibodeaux said. Averaging only 15.1 points per game this season, Colorado faces a stiff challenge. The Buffaloes fell 26-3 at California last Saturday, with quarterback Brendon Lewis passing for only 69 yards and the rushing offense gaining just 35 yards. Lewis was sacked six times, which bodes well for Thibodeaux and the Oregon front seven. “That wasn’t the type of game I was expecting at all,” Colorado head coach Karl Dorrell said of the Cal loss, speaking to the Boulder Daily Camera. The result sparked an immediate staff change. Colorado relieved offensive line coach Mitch Rodrigue of his duties on Monday. “We still have five games remaining in the season and can work hard to do what we can to improve our offensive line play,” Dorrell said. “We have struggled most of the season, and without much consistency up front, it’s been hard to find an identity for our offense. Not all of this is on Mitch, but in the end, it falls on the coaches.” — Field Level Media","","nationalpost"

"Victoria's draft pandemic law misses one critical element – stronger oversight of the government's decisions","https://theconversation.com/victorias-draft-pandemic-law-misses-one-critical-element-stronger-oversight-of-the-governments-decisions-170623","","['William Partlett', ' Associate Professor', ' The University of Melbourne']","","","The Victorian government is introducing a pandemic management bill that will structure its ongoing and future response to pandemics. According to a draft dated October 23, the bill gives the executive wide powers in the time of a pandemic, including detention powers and the possibility of two years in prison for failing to comply with a pandemic order. But drawing on the practice in other jurisdictions such as NSW and NZ, it also seeks to create safeguards on these powers. Perhaps the best example is the transfer of decision-making power from the unelected chief health officer to the health minister, who is responsible to parliament. In one critical way, however, the bill rejects a key parliamentary safeguard that is used in NSW and NZ. Instead of creating a dedicated cross-party parliamentary committee to oversee the exercise of these broad public health powers, it creates an executive-appointed oversight committee for this purpose. The use of an appointed committee to oversee these powers is a problematic departure from the usual role of parliamentary committees in the scrutiny of executive governance. To ensure a fuller set of safeguards, dedicated parliamentary oversight should be created alongside that of an appointed committee. Read more: As Melbourne cautiously opens up today, what lies ahead? What the bill would do Victoria’s draft bill comes at an important time. It is the first fit-for-purpose law in Australia seeking permanently to structure the way a state or territory government should respond to a pandemic. It provides the Victorian premier with extraordinary power to make pandemic declarations and extend them for “three months at a time, with no outer limit on the total duration of a declaration”. Once in place, the health minister has broad powers to issue “pandemic orders”; failure to comply could lead to two years in prison. Some of the bill’s provisions respond to the need to balance democratic accountability with an emergency pandemic response. This is particularly so with those creating protections on people’s privacy when checking in with QR codes, and ensuring more transparency in the government’s decision-making process. But the bill breaks significantly with Australian democratic tradition in one key way. It gives the health minister the power to reinstate a pandemic order that has been disallowed by a key parliamentary committee. Moreover, it gives oversight of these pandemic powers to an appointed non-parliamentary committee. The creation of this kind of specialised committee (made up of public health and human rights experts) is a good idea. But it should not replace oversight by a dedicated cross-party parliamentary committee. The makeup, powers, and funding of parliamentary scrutiny bodies are well established in Australia, having been part of our parliamentary governance for more than a century. By contrast, the specialised committee created in this bill is largely advisory. It is fully appointed by the Victorian government and, according to the draft legislation, has no statutory powers to ensure its oversight role (such as guaranteed funding or the power to compel testimony). This appointed committee should not replace specialised parliamentary scrutiny. In fact, the Human Rights Law Centre actually recommended establishing an independent committee of this type alongside a “dedicated cross-party parliamentary committee” in a recent report. Read more: Explainer: why is the Victorian government extending the state of emergency, and is it justified? The importance of parliamentary checks and balances Unlike many other liberal democracies, such as the United States or Germany, which have constitutional bills of rights, Australia does not have strong judicial checks on government overreach. Instead, Australia’s liberal democracy relies heavily on political checks and balances contained within parliamentary oversight of the executive branch. The elected upper houses of parliaments have emerged as key institutions in this oversight, developing cross-party committees at both the national and state level that oversee the executive branch’s implementation of the law. The pandemic has undermined this parliamentary oversight at all levels of Australian government. This has been particularly noticeable at the state level, where premiers and health officials have used broad emergency powers to close state borders and issue stay-at-home orders. These powers have often been issued with minimal parliamentary scrutiny. For instance, at times, parliaments have been suspended for health reasons. How NSW and New Zealand have established oversight This shift toward executive governance at the state level is understandable on a short-term basis, as the pandemic requires rapid and flexible policymaking that is simply not possible through parliamentary process. But some jurisdictions have recently figured out ways of ensuring parliamentary scrutiny even during a pandemic state of emergency. In response to pressure from opposition parties (particularly the Greens) in NSW, for example, the upper house of parliament created a permanent oversight committee of the executive’s pandemic response. This body live-streams and records its oversight hearings on YouTube. New Zealand, with a similar tradition of parliamentary checks on executive overreach, also created a specialised parliamentary oversight body at the beginning of the pandemic. This was led by the leader of the opposition and live-streamed its hearings. These bodies are underpinned by the idea that when operating at such speed, mistakes are sometimes made. To date, Victoria has not yet followed this trend toward specialised parliamentary oversight of the government’s pandemic response. Instead, it has taken the route of external, independent review. The best example is the judicial inquiry into the staffing of quarantine hotels prior to Victoria’s devastating second wave in 2020. Read more: Expanding Victoria's police powers without robust, independent oversight is a dangerous idea Where to from here? As the proposed bill is debated in parliament, the government must answer a key question: why depart from this practice of emergency parliamentary oversight and instead choose review by a wholly appointed and weak independent committee? Given the vast powers given here, there appears to be little justification. The bill should therefore be amended to include cross-parliamentary oversight alongside independent oversight. This will not only better accord with Australia’s democratic traditions, it will also better preserve trust between government and the people – a critical resource in any pandemic response.

"Mitchell Pearce is not the only target for Catalans","https://www.newcastleherald.com.au/story/7485559/mitchell-pearce-is-not-the-only-target-for-catalans/?src=rss","","['George Clarke']","","The Knights are yet to agree for their halfback to explore his options.","","2021-10-26 05:34:00","Mitchell Pearce isn't the only NRL target the Catalans Dragons have their eyes on as the Newcastle playmaker looks increasingly likely to swap the Hunter Valley for the south of France. Pearce has been linked with an immediate move away from the Knights where he is contracted until the end of the 2022 season. The departure of James Maloney from the French club following their maiden Super League grand final appearance has opened the door for Pearce to head to Perpignan. The sticking point remains, though, that the Knights are yet to agree for Pearce to explore his options and Catalans are yet to table an offer. ""We've been mindful that we don't want to just go and grab anything,"" Catalans' football manager, Alex Chan, said of their search for Maloney's replacement. ""We want to do our due diligence and make sure we will add to an existing group because of what's available. ""We're not just in the market to fill spots. There's a connection with Steve McNamara - our head coach - they are really close from their history together at the Roosters. ""We've shown we are interested in him, but it comes down to whether Newcastle are prepared to let him go early."" Should Pearce, 32, leave Newcastle, the blow would be softened for the Knights in the fact they have signed St George Illawarra's Adam Clune and Jake Clifford over the past 12 months. Young playmaker Phoenix Crossland has agreed to a new one-year contract with the club, while Kalyn Ponga could also shift into the halves. A move to France is not just an option for the Knights No.7, with Catalans actively looking in the NRL market to fill their foreign quota. Under Super League rules clubs are allowed to import seven players from overseas. Catalans have Sam Kasiano, Dean Whare, Samisoni Langi and Josh Drinkwater on the books for 2022, meaning there they have three spots available. ""We're probably looking for another strong middle with some size as well as an outside back,"" Chan added. ""We're lucky at the moment in the young crop we've got coming through, some of whom played for France in the Test against England on the weekend. ""We will continue to work hard for those boys to bring them up to the standard."" ""But for us, it's always about adding value.""

China's state planner was to meet with property firms carrying large dollar-denominated debts later in the day to take stock of their total issuance volume and repayment capability, amid the mounting concerns about liquidity. Evergrande, which narrowly averted a costly default last week, is reeling under more than $300 million in liabilities and has a major payment deadline on Friday. Modern Land (China) Co Ltd said in a filing that it had not repaid principal and interest on its 12.85% senior notes that matured on Monday due to ""unexpected liquidity issues"". This follows a default by Fantasia Holdings Group on a maturing dollar bond in early October that heightened concerns in international debt markets, already roiled by worries over whether Evergrande would meet its obligations. Developers are defaulting ""one by one"", said an investor with exposure to Chinese high-yield debt, who asked not to be named as he was not authorised to speak with media. ""The question is always, who's next?"" Shares of Chinese property shares extended losses, hurt also by concerns over plans to introduce a real estate tax. China's CSI 300 Real Estate Index fell 2.6%, and the Hang Seng Mainland Properties Index slumped nearly 5%. The prospect of contagion and more defaults have weighed on the sector in a major setback for investors. Chinese Estates Holdings Ltd said it would book a loss of HK$288.37 million in the current financial year from its latest sale of bonds issued by Chinese property developer Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd. Shares in China Evergrande Group's electric vehicle (EV) unit rose as much as 5.8% early on Tuesday, as the cash-strapped developer said it would prioritise the growth of its EV business, before reversing course to slump 3%. China Evergrande gave up early gains to fall 6%.","","bangkokpost"
"Eternals review: A unique Marvel entry that doesn't quite hit the mark - CNET","https://www.cnet.com/news/eternals-review-a-unique-marvel-entry-that-doesnt-quite-hit-the-mark/#ftag=CADf328eec","","['Mike Sorrentino']","","Chloe Zhao's fine take on blockbuster fare is weighed down by a confusing plot.","","2021-10-26 05:33:00","Eternals (2021) Marvel Studios The latest entry to the Marvel Cinematic Universe has an ambitious goal: Eternals aims to reveal new events in the MCU that no one knew took place over thousands of years. It's a complicated task, involving multiple time periods, a huge cast and plenty of infodumps. Unfortunately, for me, the whole package doesn't quite work. The Eternals, we discover, are superheroes who lived on Earth throughout the entire saga of the Marvel films. They include Ajak (Salma Hayek), Sersi (Gemma Chan), Ikaris (Richard Madden), Thena (Angelina Jolie), Klingo (Kumail Nanjiani), Sprite (Lia McHugh), Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), Druig (Barry Keoghan) and Gilgamesh (Ma Dong-seok). Get the CNET Culture newsletter Explore movies, games, superheroes and more with CNET Culture. Delivered Tuesdays and Fridays. These heroes discuss their own backstories early and often, from a failed romantic relationship between two characters that lasted 5,000 years, to a medical condition that might require a memory-wiping procedure. There's a whole lot of talk about these details that surprisingly don't go much deeper, despite a hefty 2-and-a-half-hour runtime. Angelina Jolie plays Thena. Marvel Studios You end up having to wait through the entire first half to actually see what powers these heroes are capable of. Fortunately, it's worth it: The variety of gorgeous action sequences showcase the Eternals at war with the Deviants, which look like CGI wolves made of wires. They are apparently the only creatures the Eternals can engage their time and powers against, providing a fairly weak excuse for why they choose to sit out most human conflicts. Not to mention that one time Thanos snapped away half of the universe. It's an odd restriction when many of the Eternals describe how much they wish to protect human society. The powers themselves aren't particularly memorable. Thena can make luminous weapons appear out of thin air. Ajak can heal. Sersi can turn stone into other elements. Ikaris can fly and shoot laser beams. The most interesting character to me was Phastos: He can seemingly invent technology whenever he wants. Among the group, no one is a jack-of-all-trades-type like Brie Larson's Captain Marvel , nor particularly specialized at their skill like Scarlett Johannsson's Black Widow. At one point Ikaris is called Superman, only stamping home the feeling Eternals' lacks a clear identity. Marvel's Eternals brings a new group of heroes together. Marvel Studios/Screenshot by Sean Keane/CNET The non-linear storytelling can be confusing: We are whisked back and forth in time, across constantly changing international settings. One minute the Eternals are with humans in the Stone age. The next they're back in the present day. Then we flash back to an event 2,000 years in the past, then forward again. It might be a natural journey for the characters, but I felt whiplash. It might have helped if the characters wore outfits that reflected the society they were visiting, instead of sticking to superhero suits in the past and casual jackets and jeans in the present. Still, the time-hopping is what places director Chloé Zhao's entry in a different space from the recently wrapped Infinity Saga. While I wouldn't recommend this as a first-time Marvel watch for anyone, the only cursory knowledge it requires is that Eternals' present day storyline takes place in the fallout of Avengers: Endgame . You should also take note that there are two end-credit scenes to wait for. Eternals was originally supposed to be the first Marvel movie after Spider-Man: Far From Home , set to further dive into the ramifications of post-blip life. Instead, that honor went to Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings , which from introduction to post-credits scene told a story with a new voice in the Marvel universe. While I appreciate that Eternals takes a creative risk with its time-jumping events, its convoluted plot ultimately lets it down.

The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Office of the Vice President, Laolu Akande, communicated this in a statement in Abuja. The statement said Buhari, represented by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, gave a virtual address at the opening of the 27th Nigerian Economic Summit. The theme of the summit is, “Securing our Future: The Fierce Urgency of Now.’’ Buhari said in order to tackle existing problems and at the same time benefit from domestic and global trends, stakeholders both in public and private sectors must take timely actions and immediate steps. The president emphasised the imperative of the theme of the summit, saying the theme is compelling as it stresses the importance of taking timely action to tackle existing problems while at the same time, taking immediate steps to cope with or benefit from domestic and global trends. According to him, growth figures are meaningless if they do not translate into good-paying jobs and improved standard of living for our people. “The question, of course, I insist, that must be answered regarding all our policies, is what do they mean for the creation of wealth and human capacity development? “The new plan incorporates aspects of the National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy, which was articulated as a guide towards achieving our poverty reduction target. “The starting point for the implementation of the Strategy is the realisation that increased employment is an indispensable tool for reducing poverty. “The Federal Government is responding to the challenges and opportunities of the moment by articulating forward-looking policies and strategies and implementing a coherent, clear and consistent set of actions in order to achieve our desired objectives,’’ he stated.

And she hopes she is dishing out the lessons this afternoon in Ireland’s pivotal World Cup qualifier with Finland. Amber Barrett will play where the coach wants as long as she’s in the teamSportsfile The Girls in Green are in Helsinki for their second game of the campaign. But it could turn out to be the crucial one by the end. The lessons of the Euro 2020 campaign —  when Ireland lost away to Ukraine in the pivotal game —  have been absorbed. But Barrett — a qualified secondary school teacher — insisted that there is always something new to learn, as she discovered last month. Normally a No 9, Barrett was asked to play further back in midfield by boss Vera Pauw and learned fast. She said: “Vera had a conversation with me in the last camp where she mentioned she wanted me to play this role. “When the manager wants you to play a certain position and it means representing your country, you’ll play anywhere.

She said I probably have the speed that others don’t to get up and down the pitch. “We were down numbers in the last camp, Megan Connolly was a big loss. Maybe I just filled in a role but I’d be happy to play in goal if Vera wanted. “If you look at the best players in the world, they’re all flexible. “Katie McCabe can go left midfield, left wing, go in as a No 10. The same with Denise O’Sullivan. “We need to have that flexibility in our positions. It’s something I have to learn and adapt to. PRO FOOTBALL “Other players are good at what you’re good at, or better at it. You have to be learning, getting better at things. “And that’s why the majority of players have moved abroad into professional football. “You get exposed to a situation where you can’t just knock the ball past someone because the defenders are as quick as you.” What she has found harder to grasp is her exclusion at club level with FC Koln. A regular since she moved to Germany from Peamount two years ago, the 25-year-old is not in the team, and frustrated with no guidance on what she has to do to get back into it. Barrett added: “If you’d asked me last week, you would have got a very fiery response! I’m just a wee bit frustrated. CLUB ISSUES “I’m always honest if someone is playing better or I’m not training as good but I’m not getting a look-in no matter what I’m doing. “They’re not very helpful in terms of what I need to do. They said to stay positive but my idea of positive is different. “Something’s not right if I’m not playing. I feel good.  My head’s good, which is important. I haven’t killed anybody yet! “Seriously, the coach has been good for me and very helpful but sometimes I just want to get a little bit of feedback.” Barrett did not start in Thursday’s loss to Sweden with Connolly available again, but she was sprung from the bench. The manner of the defeat —  via a Louise Quinn OG —  was disappointing. But the  performance was not as Barrett stressed that they remain confident. FIGHTING FOR SECOND And all last week, everyone connected to the squad knew that today against Finland is the bigger match. Top seeds Sweden are expected to win every game which will leave Ireland, the Finns and Slovakia  scraping for second place and a play-off. The head-to-heads are likely to prove crucial and Barrett said: “We’ll do our homework and be prepared. “I know for a fact that Finland will be thinking that they have to get three points off us as well. “Even at this early stage, it’s   definitely a six-pointer. A positive result in Helsinki to get us really started in the group is exactly what we’re looking for.","2021-10-26 05:30:00","","","thesun_ie"

In an intense clash at the Euroborg Stadium in Groningen, Ngonge produced a beauty as he executed a tough skill in front of the home fans to give his team the lead. In the 20th minute, winger Mohamed El Hankouri cut back in from the left wing and curled a cross towards Ngonge near AZ's penalty spot. With the ball a tad bit behind him, Ngonge cleverly waited for the ball and used his left heel to put the ball into the back of the net, leaving the goalkeeper and defender in complete disbelief. Moment van de Week: Wat een goal van @cyrilngonge27 ! Highlights van #groaz staan nu online: https://t.co/IJ7p07Saux #trotsvanhetnoorden pic.twitter.com/2tetfnfMg0 As soon as the ball went in, the crowd erupted in joy while the commentators couldn't find words to describe the goal with many fans saying that the goal was worthy of the Puskas award. The interesting aspect of the match proved to be AZ's 21 shots as compared to the home team's nine. AZ even registered more shots on target, nine, to Groningen's four. AZ's 65 per cent ball possession and 11 corners didn't yield the desired results for the team. They even enjoyed more passing accuracy, completing 625 passes against 336 by the Groninger players. Promoted Despite dominating the stats, AZ failed to find a way past Groningen's goalkeeper Peter Leeuwenburgh as the home team registered a 2-0 victory, thanks to striker Michael de Leeuw doubling the lead in the 71st minute. The home team struck when it mattered the most and a goal in each half secured them 15th position in the points table.","https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-10/a9odqk8s_cyril-ngonge_120x90_26_October_21.jpg","ndtv"

"SK Hynix more upbeat than rivals on rising memory-chip demand","https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/sk-hynix-more-upbeat-rivals-rising-memory-chip-demand-2269037","","","","","","2021-10-26 05:29:34","SEOUL : SK Hynix forecast steady demand for memory chips on Tuesday as it posted its highest quarterly operating profit in nearly three years on the back of rising prices, striking a more bullish note than rivals including Micron. SK Hynix and other other chipmakers have been hit by slowing personal computer sales after a pandemic-led surge, but the South Korean company said supply bottlenecks had created pent-up demand for PC chips that could boost sales next year. ""There have been a lot of uncertainties recently, but I think memory is still doing business at a level that provides good supply and predictability compared to other semiconductors,"" SK Hynix's chief financial officer, Kevin Noh, told an earnings call. Intel said earlier this month shortages of other chips were stopping its customers from shipping PCs and servers, echoing comments from Micron. Corporate demand and changing hybrid working environments would also underpin PC chip demand, said SK Hynix, which trails only Samsung Electronics Co Ltd in DRAM chips used for temporary storage in PCs, servers and mobile devices. An expected replacement cycle of equipment bought by data centres during 2017-2018 will create demand for server chips, Hynix added. SK Hynix shares rose 3per cent on Tuesday compared with a 0.6per cent rise in the wider market. Operating profit rose to 4.2 trillion won (US$3.6 billion) in the July-September quarter, up from 1.3 trillion won a year earlier, SK Hynix said. That was its highest quarterly profit since the fourth quarter of 2018, and above a Refinitiv Smartestimate of 4.1 trillion won from 18 analysts. The Apple Inc supplier's NAND business turned profitable for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2018, analysts said. NAND chips are used for permanent storage in mobile devices and servers. SK Hynix said it expected Chinese regulators to approve its deal to buy Intel's NAND business this year. Analysts said the company had improved the yield of its 128-layer NAND flash chips that serve the data storage market, which would propel shipments. SK Hynix said third-quarter revenue rose 45per cent on-year to a record 11.8 trillion won.

After Dennis Schroder tied it at 129 on a 3-pointer with 2:41 left in overtime, Brown added a trey of his own and followed it with an emphatic dunk at the 1:21 mark. Schroder added four consecutive free throws and Tatum made two to put the game away. Tatum dished eight assists while Brown grabbed nine rebounds. Schroder finished with 23 points, eight assists and six rebounds for Boston, which had dropped two in a row to open the season before a 107-97 win at Houston on Sunday. Miles Bridges and LaMelo Ball scored 25 apiece to lead the Hornets. Bridges, who was named the Eastern Conference’s Player of the Week earlier Monday, also grabbed 10 boards. Ball contributed nine assists. Heat 107, Magic 90 Jimmy Butler scored 24 of his 36 points in the first half to fuel host Miami to its sixth win in seven meetings against Orlando. Butler made 15 of 21 shots from the floor and added five steals, and his sharpshooting was significantly better than his previous game. He made just 7 of 22 shots in Miami’s 102-91 overtime loss to the Indiana Pacers on Saturday. Bam Adebayo collected 16 points and 13 rebounds to record his third straight double-double to begin the season. Markieff Morris had 16 points off the bench for the Heat. The Magic were led by Franz Wagner and Jalen Suggs, who each scored 15 points. Bucks 119, Pacers 109 Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 30 points, grabbed 10 rebounds and dished nine assists, Khris Middleton added 27 points and Milwaukee held on for a win over Indiana in Indianapolis. An 11-2 run that sent Milwaukee into halftime and extended into the early third quarter gave the Bucks a double-digit-point lead for most of the second half. The gap grew to as many as 18 points. Malcolm Brogdon led the Pacers with 25 points and seven assists, though he also committed seven turnovers. Domantas Sabonis contributed 21 points and 13 rebounds. Nets 104, Wizards 90 Kevin Durant scored 25 points and Brooklyn led virtually the entire way in a victory over Washington in New York. Durant followed up a 38-point effort by shooting 9 of 17 from the field in 35 minutes. He added eight rebounds and four assists. Nets reserve Patty Mills hit five 3-pointers and finished with 21 points. Bradley Beal paced the Wizards with 19 points. Daniel Gafford scored 13 for Washington, which shot just 34.7 percent from the floor. Bulls 111, Raptors 108 DeMar DeRozan scored 26 points — 11 in the fourth quarter — and visiting Chicago defeated Toronto. DeRozan, a former Raptor, made three important jump shots late in the fourth quarter after Toronto had cut the lead to two. Toronto’s Fred VanVleet missed a 3-point attempt in the final second that would have tied the game. Zach LaVine added 22 points for the Bulls, who have won four games in a row to open the season. OG Anunoby scored 22 points for the Raptors, and VanVleet finished with 15 points and 17 assists. Cavaliers 99, Nuggets 87 Jarrett Allen had 21 points and 16 rebounds, Kevin Love scored 22 points, and visiting Cleveland won at Denver. Collin Sexton scored 14 points, Lauri Markkanen had 12 points and Evan Mobley amassed 10 points and eight rebounds for the Cavaliers. Nikola Jokic finished with 24 points and 19 rebounds for the Nuggets, who committed 22 turnovers. Pelicans 107, Timberwolves 98 Brandon Ingram scored 27 points and Jonas Valanciunas had 22 points and 23 rebounds as New Orleans got its first victory of the season, defeating Minnesota in Minneapolis. Devonte’ Graham added 21 points and Nickeil Alexander-Walker had 17 as the Pelicans bounced back from a 96-89 loss at Minnesota on Saturday. They turned the ball over 20 times, but that was a significant improvement over the franchise-record-tying 30 they committed on Saturday. Karl-Anthony Towns had 32 points and 14 rebounds, Anthony Edwards scored 28 and Patrick Beverley added 13 for the Wolves. Hawks 122, Pistons 104 Trae Young bounced back from a subpar shooting performance to score a season-high 32 points and lead Atlanta over visiting Detroit. Cam Reddish came off the Atlanta bench to score 17 points, including three 3-pointers, and Bogdan Bogdanovic and Kevin Huerter both scored 14. Detroit got 21 points each from Kelly Olynyk and Saddiq Bey — season highs for both — and 18 from Josh Jackson. The Pistons played without Jerami Grant (left elbow infection). Clippers 116, Trail Blazers 86 Luke Kennard scored 23 points off the bench to help Los Angeles roll to an easy victory over visiting Portland. Kennard made 8 of 10 field-goal attempts, including 6 of 7 from 3-point range, as Los Angeles notched its first win of the season in its third contest. Reggie Jackson scored 18 points and Paul George contributed 16 points and a career-best eight steals for the Clippers, who defeated the Trail Blazers for the seventh consecutive time. CJ McCollum scored 20 points for Portland, which committed 30 turnovers while losing for the second time in three games under new coach Chauncey Billups. Damian Lillard had just 12 points on 4-of-15 shooting while missing all eight of his 3-point attempts. –Field Level Media","","nationalpost"

The post This Massage Gun is Currently on Sale and Will Sort Out Your Back Knots appeared first on Lifehacker Australia.","Lockdown again. Not unfamiliar, but definitely unwanted. I am like I’m sure most people are, trying to keep busy with a series of hobbies that aren’t outside my field of general interest, but far enough outside my immediate reach that I usually wouldn’t be arsed with them in everyday reality. I’ve begun parading as a limber geriatric, spending my increasingly free hours knitting, cooking soups with the persistence of a madwoman and running. Running is a fickle friend of mine. We have periods of intense infatuation and then almost as quickly as we started up, I won’t see her for months. There is no going steady for us. It’s either a shotgun wedding in Las Vegas or the cold shoulder. During this lockdown, I’ve had to sub her back into my life to break up the Love Island marathons. When you’re improving your mind at such a rapid rate, it’s important that you don’t leave the body behind too. Of course, this rapid transformation from couch potato to Usain Bolt with a uterus has left my body crampy and sore. Enter the Bob and Brad C2 massage gun – a treat and a half. Update 26/10: The Bob and Brad C2 massage gun is currently on sale for $109.99, down from $159.99, when you use the $50 off coupon via Amazon. How does it work? Image: Bob and Brad The massage gun is shaped like a drill and has a surprising weight to it. The design is rather ergonomic while the weight makes it feel sturdier, but I found it a bit too heavy and bulky to use at times. The gun comes with five attachable heads – ball, bullet, fork, flat and an air cushion. At first glance, these heads kind of look like some sort of medieval torture device. When I did finally try them out, these different heads were actually quite enjoyable. The ball head, in particular, was my favourite as I found it really helped to loosen up my shoulders and lower back, which often get quite tight from hunching over a computer every day. The different heads allow you to comfortably target different muscle groups, relieving your shoulders from the Millennial slouch or your thighs from that run you did one time. The massage gun has five gears, which really means there are five-speed settings. The instruction manual includes a guide that lets you know how hard you should be going on which part of your tender bod, but I found the speeds to be super intense, even on a lower setting. Setting it to gear two was more than enough for me, so I can’t imagine how hectic it is at top speed. I wouldn’t be cranking it up to full blast on your neck. Do massage guns actually work? Surprisingly, the massage gun is not a new invention. In 1883 English physician Joseph Mortimer Granville invented an electric vibrator, which was not used for sexual pleasure but rather for curing ailments of the body. Similar devices, such as the steam-powered “manipulator” invented by Dr. George Taylor were also in use around the same time. These massagers were considered to be alternative medicine and believed to improve male impotence, stimulate hair growth for the balding, soothe upset stomachs for colic children and even help cure broken bones. Unsurprisingly, they weren’t the magic cure-all for every imaginable complaint. However, massage guns stuck around and found their place in the modern zeitgeist because they are pretty good at relaxing sore muscles. Is it worth it? Image: Bob and Brad The Bob and Brad C2 massage gun is small, compact, and comes in a little briefcase, which is perfect for transporting it from your living room to the backyard, or wherever else you may be venturing these days. Compared to big-name massage gun brands likes Theragun, which retails in the range of $349 to $899, the Bob and Brad massager goes for a more affordable $159.99 (or even less, as it’s currently on sale with the aforementioned $50 discount). It’s a convenient solution if your masseuse is closed and your dicky back hasn’t gotten the memo. You’re able to use the massager by yourself or you can ask your housemates to target some hard-to-reach areas whilst you lay splayed on the living room floor like a lumpy pancake. For me, I found the massage gun to be a bit bulky and quite intense to use, even at a low speed. That might not be a problem for some, but it’s worth considering if you want a massage gun that won’t tire you out while using it. If you’re interested in having a powerful massage on tap, this is the perfect product for you.

"E-Mode: Applying First Principles To A Complicated Law That Many Drivers Don’t Know Exists — Part 1","https://cleantechnica.com/2021/10/26/e-mode-applying-first-principles-to-a-complicated-law-that-many-drivers-dont-know-exists-part-1/","['Autonomous Vehicles', 'Cars', 'Clean Transport', 'Consumer Technology', 'Electric Cars', 'Electric Vehicles', 'Interviews', 'James Law', 'Slow Down Move Over laws', 'Tesla', 'Wreckonize']","['Johnna Crider']","","This is a feature that Tesla really needs to adopt.","","2021-10-26 05:27:15","James Law, a wreck technician and researcher who has been struck a total of four times while working, has a solution and invention that would apply first principles to a complicated law that many drivers are unaware of. It would also save lives. In a nutshell, James has developed a life-saving concept called “E-Mode” that is part of a seven-tier program named Wreckonize that can reduce struck-by incidents. He wants to donate E-Mode to Tesla. I’ve written extensively about this before. However, Kacey Green and Trevor Page of Tesla Owners Online noticed that their Teslas have been slowing down for emergency vehicles and that resurfaced the topic. Kacey has even received a message on the screen about it. As I've said on a few streams now, my car has been slowing for emergency vehicles, tonight I got the message on the screen explicitly stating this, then a separate one for slow traffic in the lane to my left. They were on the shoulder & I was center lane. 👍 — Kacey Green (@GCustom) October 1, 2021 First look at the new emergency vehicle lights speed limit on autopilot 🎥: u/pengellyb @elonmusk @JamesWLaw1 pic.twitter.com/faSvjNPunj — ⚡️Tesla Owners Online (@Model3Owners) September 25, 2021 James’ goal is to help Tesla comply well with Move Over laws, particularly as Tesla is developing FSD. This is a two-part article and this one will cover these two points. Why E-Mode is being donated to Elon for Tesla How Elon Musk’s First-Principles Thinking Helps Move Over Laws Evolve Before we dive in, E-Mode is a light sequence technology that James created to automate compliance with the Move Over law. The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) stated that after being law for 25 years, 71% of Americans don’t even know what it is . This law was put in place to prevent the deaths of emergency personnel and civilians who have to pull over on the side of the road. “The AAA has reported that the people who do know about these laws are confused and the reason for this is because every state has different laws.” Unintelligent ICE vehicles, James explained, have a high body count. “The body count was 38 struck by deaths of responders and now it is at 49: 21 Law enforcement, 18 Tow Ops, 7 fire/EMS, 1 Mobil Mechanic, 2 Safety-Service Patrol Operators. ”The number has gone up just recently and it’s now at 51 not 49.” James also noted that two Tesla Road Side Assistance (RSA) providers were killed. He added that in 2020, there were a total of 46 responders killed, and in 2019, 44 responders were killed. Why It’s Going To Elon For Tesla The first reason is simple logic. By giving this to Elon Musk, obviously, he will give E-Mode to the Tesla fleet — every Tesla owner and everyone in the community will benefit from this safety feature. James noted that with Tesla’s open-source attitude, eventually, all carmakers can use the light sequences — once they see the light (pun intended). Moreover, it would make Tesla the first company in history to have complete Move Over Law awareness of its customers and the fleet. “E-mode isn’t just light sequences, it’s a prescribed behavior.” James explained that he’s studied these laws in every province in Canada and every state in the U.S. He’s also studied them in Australia and is studying them in other countries. The key problem is confusion regarding these laws. He pointed out that they need to be simplified in a similar fashion as to how we were taught what to do when we are on fire. You stop, drop and roll. Clear, precise, and easy to remember. “When you see a car on the side of the road whether it’s a fire truck or just a civilian, the behavior that Tesla will do will be for all vehicles because these laws are slowly changing. They’re evolving. I know where they’re going to evolve to.” James explained that he knows the complete 25-year history of the Move Over Laws and that he’s friends with the person who started the laws. His friend started out as an EMS technician and was struck in 1994. This inspired him to lead efforts that eventually began what is now known as the Move Over laws. The laws started out for emergency vehicles and have since expanded to tow trucks in all 50 states. However, 10 states have now included any vehicle with hazard lights on the side of the highway in order to protect civilians as well. While James had been looking into Tesla and started to learn and understand Elon Musk, he discovered Elon’s “first principles” approach to problems. Photo by James Law, used with permission. 4 pics of tow hazards (tow trucks are hard to detect because their flashing light are often blocked by the vehicle that is being towed, especially flatbed tow trucks and heavy semi tow trucks). James explained that he was lucky. The first time he had been struck, he was 18 and had just started his company. It taught him to become hyper-aware of traffic. He started training and teaching his employees what to watch out for in traffic flow and how to survive while working the scene of a wreck or incident on the side of the road. These protocols that James put in place saved his life a total of four times. But the problem now is how does oncoming traffic deal with these situations? Obviously, following the law is a must, but as the NHTSA said, 71% of drivers don’t know of these laws. This is where James applied Elon’s first-principles approach. “Looking at the complications of these laws, it’s just so complicated that your brain will go crazy trying to read all of these laws. So I try to do what Elon does. What do we know about Elon? You take something really complicated and you simplify it into an undeniable truth. Stop making stuff, there’s no more stuff.” Solving a Complicated Problem The inconsistencies in the wording of the Move Over laws between states (because traffic laws must be passed by each individual state) have understandably led to confusion. For the past 10 years, James has pushed for a straightforward protocol based on physics. Simple, clear, and precise. However, there is very little incentive to change these laws, and when there is change, it’s usually to increase penalties. Looking for a solution in Tesla’s AI, James came across the video where Elon explains using first principles for problem-solving. When James applied this first principles physics method, he found what Elon calls a “fundamental truth.” James explained that there was consistency in cases where an emergency vehicle was hit. He has looked at several hundred struck-by incidents and it’s there. He brought his findings to his friend, James D. Garcia, who had originally started the Move Over laws and has been a safety advocate at the Emergency Responders Safety Institute since 2002. He also helped get the Move Over laws written into Chapter 6. I-MUTCD 2002 Edition Federal Highway Administration . James told me that it didn’t take long for Mr. Garcia to realize that James’ findings using Elon’s first principles method had clearly ended a 25-year argumentative phase. Ending the “and/or” debate. This was a pivotal moment in the history of this 100-year-old problem The debate was about these wordings: Move over or slow down Slow down or move over Move over and slow down Slow down and move over And the variation in specific speed reduction “Simple, and unarguable.” James shared what he called an immutable universal fundamental truth: “People have hit and killed people with a vehicle by not moving over. People have hit and killed people with a vehicle by not slowing down. People have hit and killed people with a vehicle by not being prepared to stop. But, zero — not one single death — has occurred by a vehicle that slowed down, then moved over and was prepared to stop. “‘Slow Down, Then Move over and be prepared to stop.’ If you cannot move into the next lane, you can still Slow Down, Then Move Over within your lane. If you have to stop to avoid a collision, then stop. All lanes are affected.” James told me that on that night, they both agreed on the wording for the laws for humans. James went on to write the protocols for autonomous vehicles that surpass human behavior based on first principles, the laws of physics, and Asimov’s three laws to robotics, hence E-Mode! “Mr. Garcia’s mission is now for uniformity and consistency of legislation wording. This will take time.” What does this mean for Tesla? If Elon adopts E-Mode and programs Tesla with the respective behavior, the Tesla fleet surpasses the expectations of the current Move Over laws in every state and every province. “E-Mode will be semi-automated where the driver easily triggers the respective sequence Right, Left, or All Stop.” As for full automation E-Modes, James has not disclosed any information on that to protect the idea for Tesla. “I can’t say much about it except that there’s more than meets the eye. It’s a mind-blowing aspect of the feature and that’ll be Elon’s job to announce that, not mine.” Speaking of jobs, James told me that after Part Deux of this article, he’ll be applying at Tesla to be an ADAS Operator. He believes Tesla could be trained to “Wreckonize” these hazards within a year. This would set the example for all companies. “In ten years, struck by incidents could be a thing of the past” Stay tuned for Part Deux: How Tesla is actively changing traffic behavior and how the Cybertruck could play a major role in reducing struck-by incidents, saving the government millions of dollars in the process. That’ll be coming in 2 weeks-ish, Elon time. Appreciate CleanTechnica’s originality? Consider becoming a CleanTechnica Member, Supporter, Technician, or Ambassador — or a patron on Patreon .

"Facebook Removes Jair Bolsonaro Video Linking COVID-19 Shots to AIDS","https://gadgets.ndtv.com/social-networking/news/facebook-youtube-jair-bolsonaro-covid-19-vaccine-aids-brazil-president-video-remove-block-2587981","","","","Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro found himself in social media time-out after his video warning of a supposed link between COVID-19 vaccines and AIDS triggered action by Facebook and YouTube.","","2021-10-26 05:27:11","Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro found himself in social media time-out Monday after his video warning of a supposed link between Covid-19 vaccines and AIDS triggered action by Facebook and YouTube. Facebook removed the offending video, while YouTube went further, suspending the far-right leader for one week in addition to blocking the clip. ""We removed a video from Jair Bolsonaro's channel for violating our medical disinformation policies on COVID-19 by claiming that vaccines do not reduce the risk of contracting the disease and that they cause other infectious diseases,"" YouTube said in a statement sent to AFP. Bolsonaro's latest run-in with social media networks including Facebook, on which he heavily relies to rally his base, came after he cited purported ""official reports"" from the British government — since debunked — in his weekly live address on Facebook last Thursday. He claimed the reports ""suggest that people who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 are developing Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome much faster than expected."" ""I recommend you read the article,"" he added, without saying where the information came from. ""I'm not going to read it here, because I don't want to lose my Facebook live video."" Facebook, which took down the comments late Sunday or early Monday, has removed Bolsonaro posts in the past. Earlier, it found he spread misinformation or incited people to violate social distancing policies. But this is the first time it has taken down one of his weekly live addresses, a cornerstone of his communications. Bolsonaro has violated YouTube standards once before as well, and the company said the president will not be able to post new videos or do live broadcasts for seven days. The rest of his videos on the channel, where he has 3.5 million subscribers, will remain accessible. The British government denied any such ""reports"" cited by Bolsonaro, in response to an AFP fact-checking team. The Brazilian Society of Infectious Disease Specialists said in a statement there was no evidence of any relationship between COVID-19 vaccines and AIDS. Bolsonaro's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The president has said he does not plan to be vaccinated against COVID-19, and joked in the past the vaccine could ""turn you into an alligator."" .embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }","https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/facebook_reuters_small_1528432001577.JPG","ndtv"

Zhang Jinan, Head of the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security of China, says that the 2021 Hainan Free Trade Port Worldwide Talent Attraction Program, co-hosted by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security of China and the People's Government of Hainan Province, is to recruit talents of all fields from around the world to meet the urgent needs of Hainan Free Trade Port. The recruitment is from October 2021 to June 2022, focusing on pillar industries with Hainan characteristics, strategic and emerging industries, and high-tech and cutting-edge industries, especially the three major industries -- tourism, modern services industries, and high-tech industries. Since the Master Plan for the Construction of Hainan Free Trade Port was released and started to be implemented in 2020, the main economic indicators of Hainan Province, including GDP of Hainan, fixed assets investment, total retail sales of consumer goods, have witnessed rapid growth. Xu Qifang, Head of the Organization Department of Hainan Party Committee, says that Hainan has introduced 260,000 talents since June 2020, a year-on-year increase of 391% compared with that before the release of the Master Plan. Xu Qifang adds that Hainan has issued a series of favorable policies in taxation, household registration, house purchase, car purchase, schooling support for children, and heathcare since 2018 to attract talents. To facilitate overseas talents to work in Hainan, Hainan has made 38 types of professional qualification examinations available to overseas talents including registered architect qualification and licensed pharmacist qualifcation, and has recognized 219 professional qualifications acquired overseas. Regarding taxation, the high-end talents and talents urgently needed in Hainan work in Hainan will only be taxed at a rate up to 15% for their actual tax burden of the individual income tax, if their actual tax rate is higher than 15%. In terms of healthcare, Hainan spends 3,000 to 10,000 yuan to purchase commercial health insurance for groups for every high-end talent working full time in Hainan. In addition, Hainan implements many attractive talents-related programs. Those teams rated as ""Hainan Excellent Talents Teams"" will be granted 10 to 30 million yuan as the construction fund. Shen Xiaoming, Secretary of Hainan Provincial Party Committee, says that it is now a critical period when Hainan is deepening the program and operating up in all-round way and constructing the free trade port. Hainan has a favorable environment for talents and looks forward to embracing talents from all over the world to make the best use of their talents.

The team suffered its first loss on Sunday, falling 5-2 to Nashville after giving up three first-period goals — including two on the power play. Linemates Nick Bjugstad and Nico Sturm scored for the Wild, the second straight game the fourth line has contributed. LW Kirill Kaprizov is still seeking his first goal of the season. He has five points in five games but none in the past two. Canucks update: Vancouver (3-2-1) will finally have its home opener. It hasn't faced off against the Wild since the 2020 playoffs in the Edmonton bubble when the Canucks won the best-of-five, qualifying-round series in four games. Since then, the team has struggled, going 23-29-4 last season and finishing at the bottom of the all-Canadian division. Offseason acquisition Conor Garland is off to a strong start; he's tied for the team lead in goals (three) and points (eight) and is on a six-game point streak. G Thatcher Demko has been in net for all three of Vancouver's wins. In their last game, the Canucks edged the Kraken 4-2 on Saturday in the finale of a season-opening, six-game road trip.","","startribune"

While researchers were interested in the reptile that occupied Earth hundreds of millions of years ago, the movie made people curious about it. Since then, technological advancements have let scientists uncover deep-buried facts about dinosaurs. Today, whatever we know about them, we know through fossils. There still remained one area where fossil studies were unable to reveal much about — the social behaviour of dinosaurs. However, a set of recently discovered fossils has provided a rare insight into the social lives of one dinosaur — the herbivore Mussaurus patagonicus. After studying the fossils, found in a sag basin in southern Patagonia (Argentina, South America), scientists concluded that the occurrence of many fossils of dinosaurs at different life stages within a square kilometre suggests they lived in herds nearly 190 million years ago (the fossils have been dated to 192 million years ago). The researchers also think the social cohesion of the Mussaurus may have helped it survive longer. “Most specimens were found in a restricted area and stratigraphic interval, with some articulated skeletons grouped in clusters of individuals of approximately the same age. Our new discoveries indicate the presence of social cohesion throughout life and age-segregation within a herd structure, in addition to colonial nesting behaviour,” the researchers said . The researchers studied the skeletal specimens of 80 individuals, ranging from embryos to eggs and infants to fully-grown adults. They also found evidence of individuals having formed age-based subgroups within the community. This was not unique, however. Many existing animals with notable differences in body size segregate themselves based on age. Living in a tightly knit group of the same body size allows animals to better arrange for their food and other behaviour.","https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/uk_dino_portsmouth_small_1624250010433.jpg","ndtv"

KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 26 ― The Simpsons has been praised for the inclusion of an inspirational breast cancer survivor character with one breast after unilateral mastectomy.Marking the breast cancer awareness month, Dr Wendy Sage, a hypnotherapist, made her debut on the Fox animated comedy on Sunday night's episode.According to Daily Mail, the character was developed and dubbed by actress, writer and breast cancer survivor Renee Ridgeley who is also the wife of Simpson’s showrunner Matt Selman.The episode, titled Lisa's Belly, which emphasised a watershed moment for all breast cancer survivors, was all about body positivity and those who had chosen to remain flat rather than have breast reconstructive surgery.In the episode, the new character, Sage, chose not to have surgical reconstruction after her unilateral mastectomy which survivors refer to as a “uniboob.”She also has a noticeable scar from her port-o-cath, a device placed under the skin for chemotherapy.Ridgeley, who has openly lived as a one-breasted woman, told Yahoo Life that the character Sage appears on the screen as the person she is right now.She went on to say that she has been hounding many individuals in the entertainment industry, including her spouse, regarding the inclusion of breast cancer survivors in the cast.Fans were overjoyed to see the inclusion and representation in the touching episode, which made them leave overwhelming comments for her Instagram post on her Less than two breast official page.Ridgeley was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2016 and previously opted for reconstruction after mastectomy.Her breast implants were eventually removed since they were giving her health problems.Selman, who supports his wife's advocacy work, had an index card with a note “Simpson's uniboob” on his desk for a number of years, stating that he wanted the character to blend in perfectly with the sitcom.When they started working on the new episode written by Juliet Kaufman, he thought the Sage’s character was the ideal fit for the issue of body acceptance.“The people who have watched it so far are more emotionally touched by any other episode I've ever worked on, which is just complete magic,“I did feel good about it. But people are just watching it and crying! You do want to make them laugh. But crying is a close second,” explained Selman.","2021-10-26 05:18:44","","","malaymail"

PRIVATE EYE Trainer: Joe Pride Jockey: Nash Rawiller 13 starts: 8-1-0 Major wins: Group 1 Epsom Handicap, Group 2 Queensland Guineas Thomas says: Private Eye gets back in his races but has a tremendous finishing burst as he demonstrated to win the Epsom Handicap last start. He needs a genuine tempo and plenty of pressure in his races to show his best and he gets that in the Golden Eagle. Likely to be standing the leaders a huge start on the turn but with clear galloping room he will be closing fast late. 2. I’M THUNDERSTRUCK Trainer: Mick Price and Michael Kent Junior Jockey: Hugh Bowman 8 starts: 5-0-2 Prizemoney: $905,150 Thomas says: I’m Thunderstruck won a Sale class 1 at the start of this preparation but has emerged as a genuine Group 1 horse after his luckless third in the Rupert Clark Stakes before his dominant win in the Toorak Handicap. Very promising galloper with a barnstorming finish and a tremendous will-to-win. His star is on the rise. 3. AEGON Trainer: Murray Baker and Andrew Forsman Jockey: Jason Collett 9 starts: 5-0-0 Prizemoney: $1,097,216 Major wins: Group 1 NZ 2000 Guineas, Group 2 Hobartville Stakes Thomas says: Top class Kiwi who won his first five starts but has been unplaced in his next four outings, including twice in Melbourne this spring. Aegon was sent back home after his Makybe Diva Stakes flop but has done so well since, connections have decided to target the Golden Eagle. Aegon has a good fresh record and is a Group 1 winner at 1600m. Don’t rule him out. 4. APACHE CHASE Trainer: Desleigh Forster Jockey: Jim Byrne 16 starts: 7-1-1 Prizemoney: $871,125 Major wins: Group 3 Fred Best Classic, Listed Weetwood Handicap Thomas says: The much-improved Apache Chase ended Ayrton’s unbeaten run in the Fred Best Classic in Brisbane during the winter carnival. He’s returned this spring with successive wins at Toowoomba and Eagle Farm to earn his Golden Eagle start. Apache Chase is in super form, he can either lead or tuck in behind the pace and he’s going to be very competitive. 5. AYSAR Trainer: Ben and JD Hayes Jockey: Jay Ford 13 starts: 2-4-1 Prizemoney: $577,120 Best performance: 2nd Group 1 Caulfield Guineas Thomas says: Aysar has only won two minor races but he has a proven ability to be competitive at a high level. He was runner-up in the Caulfield Guineas, Carbine Club Stakes, Manfred Stakes and CS Hayes Stakes last season and his form this spring includes a length fourth in the Group 1 Sir Rupert Clarke Stakes at Caulfield. He’s not the worst $101 shot. 6. AIM Trainer: Peter and Paul Snowden Jockey: Andrew Adkins 16 starts: 4-0-1 Prizemoney: $1,661,025 Major wins: Magic Millions 3yo Guineas, Silver Eagle Thomas says: Aim settled back in the field and avoid the carnage on the home turn before storming through to win the Silver Eagle impressively last start. Talented four-year-old who needs a firm track and a solid tempo which he will get in the Golden Eagle. The 1500m might test him but he’s racing in top form and should be in the finish. 7. AMISH BOY Trainer: Ciaron Maher and David Eustace Jockey: TBA 19 starts: 1-5-4 Prizemoney: $939,875 Best performance: 3rd Group 1 Newmarket Handicap Thomas says: Amish Boy’s conversion rate of just one win in 19 starts is a concern but he has produced some very good efforts at a high level during his career. He’s a multiple placegetter in feature races including his close third to Zoutori in the Newmarket Handicap and he nearly upset super sprinter Masked Crusader earlier this spring. He’s not out of this race. 8. EXOBOOM Trainer: Peter and Paul Snowden Jockey: TBA 12 starts: 4-4-1 Prizemoney: $307,730 Major win: Group 3 Hawkesbury Guineas Thomas says: Exoboom is a powerful gelding who is hitting form at just the right time after his fast-finishing win at Randwick last week. He has won over 1500m previously and showed his class winning the Hawkesbury Guineas earlier this year. Exoboom probably lacks the acceleration of some of his main rivals but he’s a determined horse and will be strong to the line. 9. ELLSBERG Trainer: Gerald Ryan and Sterling Alexiou Jockey: Josh Parr 11 starts: 4-4-2 Prizemoney: $429.850 Major win: Listed South Pacific Classic Thomas says: Ellsberg is a talented sprinter with good tactical speed which enables him to settle on speed and give himself every chance. He scored a strong first-up win at 1400m then came back to 1300m for the Silver Eagle and also struck interference before rallying under pressure to finish second. Definite winning chance. 10. LOVE TAP Trainer: Richard and Michael Freedman Jockey: Robbie Dolan 9 starts: 5-0-0 Prizemoney: $262,525 Major win: Group 3 Gloaming Stakes Thomas says: Love Tap showed glimpses of his talent last season with a dominant all-the-way win in the Gloaming Stakes and his game fourth to Montefilia in the Spring Champion Stakes. He’s been lightly-raced this year but won well at Kembla Grange then was competitive when fourth to Yonkers in the Shannon Stakes. He’s been kept fresh for this and had an easy barrier trial between runs. 11. COUNT DE RUPEE Trainer: Robert and Luke Price Jockey: Brock Ryan (a) 13 starts: 5-3-3 Prizemoney: $374,205 Best performance: 3rd Silver Eagle Thomas says: Improving sprinter building a consistent record. His first-up win at Kembla Grange over 1200m last month was impressive but his effort to run third in the Silver Eagle was even better. He was ready to challenge on the turn when there was severe interference and he was shunted off the course. His effort to recover and finishing fast for third was quite outstanding. One of the main chances. 12. LAWS OF INDICES Trainer: Annabel Neasham Jockey: Tommy Berry 11 starts: 3-0-1 Prizemoney: $543.228 Major win: Group 1 Prix Jean Prat Thomas says: Laws Of Indices makes his Australian debut in the Golden Eagle but the former English galloper has obvious ability as he showed winning the Group 1 Prix Jean Prat at Deauville in France in July. There has been good money for Laws Of Indices but his best form is over sprint distances, he hasn’t been out further than 1400m and probably needs some cut in the ground to show his best. 13. MAXIMAL Trainer: John O’Shea Jockey: Sam Clipperton 8 starts: 1-5-0 Prizemoney: $96,300 Best performance: 2nd Listed Dee Stakes, 2nd Listed Henry Cecil Stakes Thomas says: Maximal is a three-quarter brother to all-time great Frankel and although he has only one win in eight starts, he has held his own against the best three-year-olds in Europe this year. He has finished second behind Hurricane Lane and the unbeaten Baaeed, and ran a close fourth to Poetic Flare at Royal Ascot. Maximal has been heavily backed to win the Golden Eagle. 14. REVE DE VOL Trainer: Annabel Neasham Jockey: Brodie Loy 8 starts: 2-1-1 Prizemoney: $87,630 Major win: Listed Orby Stakes Thomas says: Reve De Vol is a talented former Irish galloper with his best form around 2000m including his win in the Orby Stakes at The Curragh. He last raced in August when a good second in the Group 3 Royal Whip Stakes. Reve De Vol has to come back to 1500m for the Golden Eagle and also may be better with some give in the track but he does have good finishing speed. 15. FORBIDDEN LOVE Trainer: Richard and Michael Freedman Jockey: Jean Van Overmeire 17 starts: 5-0-5 Prizemoney: $946,650 Major win: Group 1 Surround Stakes Thomas says: Classy mare who followed a couple of indifferent runs with a much-improved effort when third to Icebath in The Invitation last week. Forbidden Love looks to have found form again at just the right time for the Golden Eagle. She has the ability to win this race but might need a track with some give in it to be at her best. 16. VANGELIC Trainer: Gai Waterhouse and Adrian Bott Jockey: Tim Clark 16 starts: 2-3-2 Prizemoney: $674,800 Major win: Group 2 Golden Pendant Thomas says: Vangelic scored a deserved win in the Golden Pendant last month when she led throughout, controlled the tempo to suit and defied her challengers late. She was then involved in the Silver Eagle scrimmage on the turn and was eased out of the race before her fifth in The Invitation last week. Likely leader, this very fit, underrated mare will be in front for a long way. 17. MEDIA AWARD Trainer: Chris Calthorpe Jockey: Jack Martin 7 starts: 3-1-1 Prizemoney: $344,200 Major win: Group 1 Australian Oaks Thomas says: Media Award won the Australian Oaks over 2000m at Morphettville in May and had not raced since until resuming in The Invitation last week where she ran eighth to Icebath. She ran a solid race, working to the line over 1400m to be beaten three lengths on the line. She is better over further but will be running on and could sneak into the minor money. 18. ATISHU Trainer: Chris Waller Jockey: Glyn Schofield 13 starts: 6-2-2 Prizemoney: $251,445 Major win: Group 3 Bill Ritchie Handicap Thomas says: Atishu came back in distance to win the Bill Ritchie Handicap narrowly then went to the Randwick mile and ran a very competitive sixth in the Epsom Handicap behind Private Eye. She loomed as a winning chance at the 250m and fought hard to the line. She has been kept fresh since and is good enough to be in the finish.

Not only is one of the country’s biggest property developers China Evergrande teetering on the brink of collapse, but the Chinese Communist Party also announced plans to trial property taxes on both residential and commercial properties. It’s a big move considering an estimated two thirds of wealth is tied up in property in China, 90 per cent of families in urban areas own their home and around 10 per cent own three properties. The proposed tax, which would be an annual levy based on the value of the house, has experts warning it could cause a collapse in house prices and also impact consumer spending. Michael Shoebridge, director of defence, strategy and national security at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said it was clear the Chinese government wants to find a way to deflate the overheated property market. But he said the property taxes risk causing way too much damage to an already distressed market. Chinese President Xi Jinping has already been forced to scrap introducing the property tax nationally and instead is piloting a program in 10 cities, he noted. “So there is a recognition of the really difficult challenges in the Chinese property market and financial sectors because of the distress of Evergrande and others,” he told news.com.au. “But even doing this pilot in 10 cities across China still sends further shock into the distressed market and signals this is going to happen to the rest of China. “The biggest issue is about social stability in China and forcing divestment in multiple properties will not just impact wealthy Chinese citizens but every day households as property is seen as a more secure investment in the Chinese economy. “That’s because other Chinese investment had high risks such as buying shares on the stock markets with rollercoasters caused due to arbitrary government intervention or investing in the tech sector, which are now subject to much greater Chinese government control, like with Ali Baba.” It has been exactly a year since Chinese businessman Jack Ma publicly criticised his communist government and since then he’s lost hundreds of billions of dollars of his vast fortune. Over the last 12 months, his business, Alibaba — pegged as China’s version of eBay, Amazon and PayPal all rolled into one — has lost around $US373 billion ($A497 billion). Meanwhile, property developers’ appetite for buying land has dropped, causing a slowdown in construction and potentially resulting in pain for Australia's most value export – iron ore, which bought in $A149 billion last financial year. Currently, China’s construction energy uses around 25 to 30 per cent of the country’s steel, which is made largely from Australia’s iron ore. A drop in demand could mean for every $US10 drop in the price of iron ore there is $A6.5 billion wiped out of Australia’s economy, according to budget estimates. “I think further slowing of construction in China probably will effect the iron ore price but Treasury forecasts have been much lower prices than market prices and a much lower iron ore price is baked into revenue projections from Treasury,” Mr Shoebridge added. China’s real estate market is responsible for around one quarter of the country’s economic output, but Mr Shoebridge said the impact on property will cause a broader problem too. “The bigger problem with the further shock to the property market and combined with other risks inside from the Chinese economy is Chinese people are now having trouble about where to put money that don’t look like big risks for them,” he said. “And when you've got a rapidly ageing population without big families, who can bail the ageing parents out of financial trouble when low risk investments is what they need and can’t find? That is the bigger picture and why this isn’t really about the housing market.” A drop in wealth for ageing parents could also put a dent in Australia university’s market with foreign students worth billions. Australia’s education exports hit $40.3 billion in 2019 but fell to $31.7 billion in 2020 and were down by 36 per cent for the first half of this year owing to border closures, according to Commonwealth Bank analysis. International students paid $12.6 billion in tuition fees in 2020 and $18.9 billion in living expenses, it also found. But Mr Shoebridge didn’t see the property issue having a big knock on effect to Australia’s education system, which has already been decimated by the pandemic. “I think the much more difficult issue for the Australian education sector to come to terms with is its very unlikely that — the kind of presence Chinese students had before the pandemic and before the fundamentally changed relationship between China and Australia — is not going to return,” he said. “If it does, it will be used as a coercive lever over universities and the Australian government and in lots of ways we shouldn’t want it to return. The idea that the economic damage in housing sector means they won’t send children to Australian universities – I don’t think that’s the primary issues for our education sector. “The message they should have got is they need to diversify away from the China market and this is only reinforced by further economic stress in the Chinese market.” As for Evergrande which continues to starve off default, Mr Shoebridge said emergency bond payments made “by the skin of their teeth” isn’t inspiring confidence that they will pull themselves out of their $400 billion debt hole. He is convinced the property developer will collapse as it doesn’t have the financial backing or heft to remain afloat. “I’m sure the Chinese authorities and the leadership of Evergrande are calling in a bunch of favours for various investors and others to help moderate its fall, but it’s pretty clear Evergrande does not look viable,” he noted. Mr Shoebridge said its likely the Chinese government is allowing a slow rolling collapse of Evergrande that lets the sector adjust and makes the damage less immediate. “As a company you would normally think there would be a much made of divestments and restructuring and a whole bunch of creditors would lose money – that would be happen in most other parts of the world with distressed business like this,” he said. “But we are seeing a managed exit of Evergrande and the Chinese authorities goal is to have that take some time to moderate the shock. “Evergrande is like a plane that is not going to fly anymore as it’s on fire and the impact depends on whether it crashes or there is a forced landing and it burns out on the runway.” A global investment bank says house prices in a major Australian city are among the world’s most “overvalued” and on the brink of bubble territory. The national economy has performed strongly throughout the pandemic, but there’s one state that continues to shine the most. Despite rates sitting at a record low, in the past year the “time to buy a dwelling” index has plummeted. Here’s why.","","news"

Brent crude futures gained 46 cents to settle at $85.99 a barrel. The contract reached a session high of $86.70 a barrel, its highest level since October 2018. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were unchanged at $83.76 a barrel after reaching $85.41 a barrel, the highest since October 2014. Both benchmarks have climbed by around 20% since the start of September. U.S. crude has risen for nine straight weeks, while Brent has risen for seven. In India, refiners' crude oil throughput in September edged higher from the previous month ""The global energy supply crunch continues to show its teeth, as oil prices extend their upward march this week, a result of traders pricing in the ongoing rise in fuel demand – which amid limited supply response is depleting global stockpiles,"" said Louise Dickson, senior oil markets analyst at Rystad Energy. Goldman Sachs said a strong rebound in global oil demand could push Brent crude prices above its year-end forecast of $90 a barrel. The bank estimated gas-to-oil switching could contribute at least 1 million barrels per day (bpd) to oil demand. After more than a year of depressed fuel demand, petrol and distillate consumption is back in line with five-year averages in the United States, the world's largest fuel consumer. Oil prices have also been bolstered by worries over coal and gas shortages in China, India and Europe, which spurred fuel switching to diesel and fuel oil for power.

"Planning To Buy A Used Royal Enfield Himalayan? Here Are The Pros And Cons","https://www.carandbike.com/news/planning-to-buy-a-used-royal-enfield-himalayan-here-are-the-pros-and-cons-2587967?publisher=newsstand&amp;utm_source=googlenews","","","","The Royal Enfield Himalayan has been a successful model for the company and has been around since 2016. Here are some pros and cons of buying a used Royal Enfield Himalayan.","","2021-10-26 05:12:52","The Royal Enfield Himalayan has been around since 2016 and it could be said that the model kick-started the budget adventure touring motorcycle segment. It has been a successful model for Royal Enfield and offers go-anywhere ability, well almost. It continues to get a 411 cc single-cylinder long stroke engine which offers enough power and torque for daily commutes and will do well on long distance rides as well. Here are a few pros and cons to keep in mind if you are looking to buy a used Royal Enfield Himalayan. One pro tip that we can give you is that look for models that were manufactured after 2018. Royal Enfield Himalayan Pros The Royal Enfield Himalayan is a comfortable motorcycle to ride. It can be ridden for long distances and does well for daily commutes too. The 411 cc long stroke engine makes 24.5 bhp and 32 Nm, which is enough for your regular riding needs. Good news is that people who are first time buyers or graduating up from a smaller motorcycle won't feel overwhelmed by the performance. The models manufactured after 2018 get ABS and fuel-injected engines, so our recommendation for you would be to get a model that has both. The Himalayan offers decent off-road capability. It can be a good tool to learn off-roading on and go on longer rides to, for example Ladakh, Spiti etc, thanks to a longer suspension travel and 220 mm of ground clearance. Maintaining and repairing the Himalayan won't be an expensive affair, compared to other expensive models. Royal Enfield has a wide network of sales and service touchpoints, so in case you are on the road, it won't be difficult to find service centre. Cons The Himalayan also got the first counterbalanced engine on any Royal Enfield, but the first carburetted Himalayan (2016-2018) has had its fair share of complaints from owners, particularly about reliability and mechanical issues. At 191 kg, it is a heavy motorcycle. So getting used to the weight, especially when going off-road, will take some time. The earlier models did have complaints of vibrations, especially if you went past the triple digit mark. Seasoned riders may find the performance of the Himalayan lacking. 0 Comments For the latest auto news and reviews , follow carandbike.com on Twitter , Facebook , and subscribe to our YouTube channel.","https://c.ndtvimg.com/2019-07/so4mlk2g_hero-xpulse-200-vs-royal-enfield-himalayan_625x300_04_July_19.jpg","carandbike"

After publicly promising to crack down, Facebook acknowledged in internal documents obtained by The Associated Press that it was “under-enforcing on confirmed abusive activity” that saw Filipina maids complaining on the social media site of being abused. Apple relented and Facebook and Instagram remained in the app store. But Facebook's crackdown seems to have had a limited effect. Even today, a quick search for “khadima,” or “maids” in Arabic, will bring up accounts featuring posed photographs of Africans and South Asians with ages and prices listed next to their images. That's even as the Philippines government has a team of workers that do nothing but scour Facebook posts each day to try and protect desperate job seekers from criminal gangs and unscrupulous recruiters using the site. While the Mideast remains a crucial source of work for women in Asia and Africa hoping to provide for their families back home, Facebook acknowledged some countries across the region have “especially egregious” human rights issues when it comes to labourers' protection. “In our investigation, domestic workers frequently complained to their recruitment agencies of being locked in their homes, starved, forced to extend their contracts indefinitely, unpaid, and repeatedly sold to other employers without their consent,” one Facebook document read. “In response, agencies commonly told them to be more agreeable.” The report added: “We also found recruitment agencies dismissing more serious crimes, such as physical or sexual assault, rather than helping domestic workers.” In a statement to the AP, Facebook said it took the problem seriously, despite the continued spread of ads exploiting foreign workers in the Mideast. “We prohibit human exploitation in no uncertain terms,” Facebook said. “We've been combating human trafficking on our platform for many years and our goal remains to prevent anyone who seeks to exploit others from having a home on our platform.” This story, along with others published Monday, is based on disclosures made to the Securities and Exchange Commission and provided to Congress in redacted form by former Facebook employee-turned-whistleblower Frances Haugen's legal counsel. The redacted versions were obtained by a consortium of news organisations, including the AP. The Wall Street Journal previously wrote about Apple's threat to remove Facebook and Instagram. Taken as a whole, the trove of documents show that Facebook's daunting size and user base around the world — a key factor in its rapid ascent and near trillion-dollar valuation — also proves to be its greatest weakness in trying to police illicit activity, such as the sale of drugs, and suspected human rights and labour abuses on its site. Activists say Facebook, based in Menlo Park, California, has both an obligation and likely the means to fully crack down on the abuses their services facilitate as it earns tens of billions of dollars each year in revenue. “While Facebook is a private company, when you have billions of users, you are effectively like a state and therefore you have social responsibilities de facto, whether you like it or not,” said Mustafa Qadri, the executive director of Equidem Research, which studies migrant labour. “These workers are being recruited and going to places to work like the Gulf, the Middle East, where there is practically no proper regulation of how they're recruited and how they're treated when they end up in the places where they work. So when you put those two things together, really, it's a recipe for disaster.” Mary Ann Abunda, who works with a nongovernmental Filipino workers' welfare group called Sandigan in Kuwait, similarly warned of the danger the site can pose. “Facebook really has two faces,” Abunda said. “Yes, as it advertises, it's connecting people, but it has also become a haven of sinister people and syndicates who wait for your weak moment to pounce on you.” Facebook, like human rights activists and others worried about labour across the Mideast, pointed to the so-called “kafala” system prevalent across much of the region's countries. Under this system, which allowed nations to import cheap foreign labour from Africa and South Asia as oil money swelled their economies beginning in the 1950s, workers find their residency bound directly to their employer, their sponsor or “kafeel.” While workers can find employment in these arrangements that allow them to send money back home, unscrupulous sponsors can exploit their labourers who often have no other legal recourse. Stories of workers having their passports seized, working nonstop without breaks, and not being properly paid long have shadowed major construction projects, whether Dubai's Expo 2020 or Qatar's upcoming FIFA 2022 World Cup. While Gulf Arab states like the UAE and Qatar insist they've improved working conditions, others like Saudi Arabia still require employers to approve their workers leaving the country. Meanwhile, maids and domestic workers can find themselves even more at risk by living alone with families in private homes. In the documents seen by the AP, Facebook acknowledges being aware of both the exploitive conditions of foreign workers and the use of Instagram to buy and trade maids online even before a 2019 report by the BBC's Arabic service on the practice in the Mideast. That BBC report sparked the threat by Cupertino, California-based Apple to remove the apps, citing examples of pictures of maids and their biographic details showing up online, according to the documents. Facebook engineers found nearly three-fourths of all problematic posts, including showing maids in videos and screenshots of their conversations, occurred on Instagram. Links to maid-selling sites predominantly affected Facebook. Over 60 percent of the material came from Saudi Arabia, with about a quarter coming from Egypt, according to the 2019 Facebook analysis. In a statement to the AP, Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development said the kingdom “stands firmly against all types of illegal practices in the labour market” and that all labour contracts must be approved by authorities. While keeping in contact with the Philippines and other nations on labour issues, the ministry said Facebook had never been in touch with it about the problem. “Obviously illegal ads posted on social media platforms make it harder to track and investigate,” the ministry said. Saudi Arabia plans “a major public awareness campaign” soon as well on illegal recruitment practices, the ministry added. Egypt did not respond to requests for comment. While Facebook disabled over 1,000 accounts on its websites, its analysis papers acknowledged that as early as 2018 the company knew it had a problem with what it referred to as “domestic servitude.” It defined the problem as a “form of trafficking of people for the purpose of working inside private homes through the use of force, fraud, coercion or deception.” The issue appeared a wide-enough problem that Facebook even used an acronym to describe it — HEx, or “human exploitation.” Users at the time reported only 2 percent of problematic content, likely due to the desire to travel abroad for work. Facebook acknowledged it only scratched the surface of the problem and that “domestic servitude content remained on the platform.” After a week, Facebook shared what it had done and Apple apparently dropped the threat. Apple did not respond to requests for comment, but Facebook acknowledged how seriously it took the threat at the time. “Removing our applications from Apple platforms would have had potentially severe consequences to the business, including depriving millions of users of access,” the analysis said. The problem, however, continues across both Facebook and Instagram. Facebook appears to acknowledge that in more recent documents seen by the AP. It described engineers accessing problematic messages in maid-recruiting agencies' inboxes, including one in which a Filipina specifically is mentioned as being “sold” by her Kuwaiti employers. “Sometimes my head and ears hurt from being hit,” another batch of messages from a Filipina in Kuwait read. “When I escape from here, how will I get my passport? And how can we get out of here? The door is always locked.” Another Filipina housemaid in Kuwait, who described being “sold” to another family through an Instagram post in December 2012, told the AP that she knew of other cases of Filipinas being “traded online like merchandise.” ""I was like an animal that was being traded by one owner to another,” said the woman, who spoke from Kuwait on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisals. “If Facebook and Instagram won't take stronger steps against this anomaly, there will be more victims like me. I was lucky because I did not end up dead or a sexual slave.” Authorities in Kuwait, where the Philippines temporarily banned domestic workers from going after an abused Filipina was found dead in a refrigerator in 2018 over a year after disappearing, did not respond to requests for comment. In the Philippines, the billions of dollars annually sent home from overseas workers represent nearly 10 percent of the country's gross domestic product. Those wanting to go abroad trust Facebook more than the private recruiting agencies monitored by the government in part over past scandals, said Bernard Olalia, who heads the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration, which has the team monitoring Facebook postings. Job seekers mistakenly believe the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration endorses some of the Facebook and Instagram accounts, in part as they misused the office's logos, he said. With the coronavirus pandemic locking down the Philippines for months, those wanting to work abroad are even more desperate than before for any opportunity. Some see “application fees” stolen by criminal gangs, he said. Others have been trafficked or sexually exploited. “Words are not enough to describe their predicament but the situation is devastating for them,” Olalia said. “They expected to recover again, they invested just to ensure they'll have a destination only to end up as victims of illegal recruitment. That's devastating on their part.” Facebook suggested a pilot programme to begin in 2021 that targeted Filipinas with pop-up messages and banner advertisements warning them about the dangers working overseas can pose. It remains unclear whether it ever began, though Facebook said in its statement to the AP that it delivers “targeted prevention and support ad campaigns in countries such as the Philippines where data suggests people may be at high risk of exploitation.” Facebook did not answer specific questions posed by the AP about its practices. Olalia said his office for the last two years had a direct line to Facebook to be able to flag suspicious accounts. But even that isn't enough as more and more pop up to replace them. “It will affect their income so they don't want to address this,” he said. That leaves some of the most-desperate job seekers in the world vulnerable to promises and possible trafficking on Facebook. “We've seen since the pandemic that these low-wage workers who literally raise our children, they build our buildings, they cook our food, they deliver our meals. They're not just low-wage workers, they're essential workers,” said Qadri, the migrant rights expert. “So we really have a duty to address these problems because our entire civilisation is dependent on these people.” .embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }","https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/fb_0_reuters_small_1513315733233.jpg","ndtv"

Co-trainer Adrian Bott, who works alongside Gai Waterhouse, confirmed the stable’s intention to start the Group 3 winner in Saturday’s $1m sprint that will feature several The Everest contenders. It’s been six months since Dawn Passage was last sighted on raceday, finishing seventh in the Doncaster Prelude on April 3 at Randwick before being sent for a spell. The stable have given him two trials this month in preparation for his first-up assignment which included a strong win over 1030m at Randwick last week in a heat where Group 1 winners Private Eye and Hungry Heart both featured. “His trial was awesome,” Bott said. “He has come back really well, in great shape. He gave him a nice hit out and wanted to give him one at this stage of his preparation. “There will be a few coming through the Everest so it will be a big ask for him first-up but it‘s more of a lead-up into races like The Hunter. “We wanted to go through races like The Hunter, The Gong and potentially the Villiers.” Dawn Passage is rated a $26 chance with TAB for the Classique Legend Stakes where the market is dominated by Everest runners. Masked Crusader heads the betting at $3 while Eduardo and Lost and Running share the second line of betting at $6. Dawn Passage was one of two horses from the stable nominated for the Classique Legend Stakes with Everest runner Embracer also among the early contenders. But Bott confirmed Embracer is now enjoying a stint in the paddock after beating home one runner in the world’s richest race on turf. The final field for the Classique Legend Stakes, which offers a $750,000 bonus to any horse that ran in The Everest who can win the race, will be declared on Wednesday morning. Originally published as Classique Legend Stakes: Gai Waterhouse and Adrian Bott target late spring riches with Dawn Passage Ray Thomas runs the rule over each of the runners in the $7.5 million Golden Eagle at Rosehill on Saturday. Annabel Neasham has been too busy to dwell on her Cox Plate nightmare as she sets her sights on winning the Golden Eagle.

The late-night host addressed the role and influence of Facebook groups. “Facebook does, for example, have coordinated groups on Facebook that sow discord and violence, including on January 6th. That’s an addition to the discord your cousin sows on Facebook by announcing she’s named her twins Dash and Otter.” Colbert cited Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s statement that the platform removes 94 percent of hate speech, contradicted by Facebook’s own researchers who admitted that in reality, the portion removed is less than 5%. “That’s a hell of a spread, mom! I know I said I got 94% on the math test, but it was actually 5%. I didn’t lie. I just really suck at math,” Colbert said. He also poked fun at Zuckerberg’s infamous sunblock incident when he was photographed surfing in Hawaii smeared in sunscreen that made him look like a ghost. “His influence was so strong that he former VP at Facebook said the specter of Zuckerberg looms in everything the company does. Okay, but is it his specter?! Or did he just wear too much sunscreen again?” Watch the video above for Stephen Colbert’s full opening monologue.","https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-26-at-12.00.30-AM.png","deadline"

"What makes a good literary hoax? A political point, for starters","https://theconversation.com/what-makes-a-good-literary-hoax-a-political-point-for-starters-170538","","['Camilla Nelson', ' Associate Professor in Media', ' University of Notre Dame Australia']","","","Spanish authors (from left), Agustin Martinez, Jorge Diaz and Antonio Mercero, who have been writing bestsellers as Carmen Mola. Quique Garcia/EPALiterary hoaxes thrive on exposure. At best, they are politically transgressive. They strip away anything smug, pretentious or hypocritical to reveal an uglier reality underneath. Hoaxes may use ethically questionable methods. But when they work, they tell us something about the relationship of art to life and politics. It’s the literary equivalent of Banksy shredding an artwork at Sotheby’s as the hammer came down. If they don’t, then we should question if they deserve to be called a hoax at all. Recently, hoaxes were in the headlines when three men leapt onto a Barcelona stage to accept a million euro literary prize awarded by the publishing house, Planeta – “unmasking” themselves as the Spanish writer, Carmen Mola in the process. “Mola”, a bestselling crime author, won the Euro prize for La Bestia – The Beast – a thriller about a serial killer stalking Madrid in the midst of a cholera epidemic. Cue global shock, followed by shrugs from authors, publishers and critics. So far, the fury has centred on who is allowed to write what, and why. However author Margaret Atwood crisply and correctly called the unveiling a “a great publicity stunt”. This hoax was embarrassing and high profile. But it was also unoriginal and apolitical. The men behind Mola said they were tired of lying. But might claiming a lucrative, prestigious prize – and a bit of ego – also have been a factor in unmasking themselves? Margaret Atwood: described the invention of Carmen Nola as a publicity stunt. Jordan Strauss/AP Pen name politics The Mola hoax infuriated many because the authors, who wrote a trilogy of ultra-violent novels starring a female detective, Inspector Elena Blanco, had generated a backstory that was more than a pseudonym. It was an identity. It was also stereotypically gendered. Mola, which roughly translates as “Carmen the cool” in English, claimed she was an academic who kept her writing career a secret because she was bashful about the allegedly transgressive subject matter. “I didn’t want my colleagues at the office, my sisters-in-law or my mother to know that I wrote a book where someone kills a woman by getting larva worms into her skull,” Mola said in an emailed interview. Email and claims of reclusiveness are the modus operandi for managing publicity arrangements for a problematic identity. Lawyer and former director of the Women’s Institute in Spain, Beatriz Gimeno, tweeted that the authors had propagated the persona of a woman through email interviews for years, for financial gain. Another commenter called it gender bending “catfishing”. According to Spanish journalist, Maria Ramirez, a Madrid feminist bookstore is now refusing to sell the Mola books on principle that “men don’t take all the space”. Historically female authors have been forced to use male pseudonyms to be published to fight for this space. Read more: Reclaim Her Name: why we should free Australia's female novelists from their male pseudonyms Did the authors see themselves as taking a poke at the history of women’s writing or gender oppression? No. They reportedly said they chose the name by chance and for fun and there was no politics associated with their choice of a woman. “Choosing a woman’s name was not a thought out thing, we don’t want to send any message. We could have put R2-D2 on it,” they said. In Australia, in the 1940s, Dymphna Cusack and Florence James used the male pseudonym, Sydney Wyborne, to win a newspaper competition for an unpublished manuscript. They make an interesting comparison to the Mola case. Sadly, once unmasked, the prize was withdrawn. They didn’t get the money or the publishing contract. Their book wasn’t published until 1951, under the new name Come in Spinner, by another publisher. According to Cusack, the delay was complicated by obscenity laws at the time, and editors’ resistance to publishing the women under their two real names. Asking questions A true hoax provokes. It questions cultural biases, shatters conventions, leaving fragments for discussion that linger for years, if not centuries. Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe, for instance, is widely credited as the first realist English novel but it was initially read as a “true history” when published in 1719, under Crusoe’s name. The first novel, or one of the first fake memoir hoaxes? This is a conversation that continues. Fast forward to 2006, when the Australian newspaper launched a “sting” on Australian publishers. The article was titled, “Would a manuscript from the 1973 Nobel laureate pass muster today?” A chapter of Patrick White’s Nobel prize winning novel, The Eye of the Storm, was sent to publishers under a pen name that was an anagram of Patrick White: Wraith Picket. The idea was copied from a similar sting by The Times of London, using writing by V.S. Naipaul. Furious publishers who rejected White’s manuscript said they were not given enough of the book to make a decision and it was sloppily presented. This simple hoax was in the tradition of the fictional Australian poet from the 1940s Ern Malley. It made a cultural point – much of the book world is driven by rank commercialism and passing fads. An editorial eye is hit and miss. Less salubrious – and more obvious – are the cultural commentary hoaxes on the saleability of sex romps, from a 1970s satire of the writing of Harold Robbins to a more recent parody of the writing style of 50 Shades of Grey. Intercultural thefts are a separate matter. They aren’t hoaxes. They are harmful appropriations. Most commonly, such theft is committed by a dominant culture and the victim is the literary heritage of an oppressed minority. This sorry history includes the so called “Virago Vicar”; an Anglican vicar named Toby Forward who published a collection of stories with the British feminist publishing house Virago under the pseudonym Rahila Khan. Identity theft involving non-fiction forms or memoir is beyond this category – it belongs in the realm of fake news and “alternative facts”. One interesting theft that keeps everybody talking – and may well endure – is the case of writer “Jeremiah Terminator Leroy”; a New York based television writer named Laura Albert who adopted the persona of a queer male sex worker from West Virginia, whose novels gave rise to a cult following. Albert convinced her sister-in-law Savannah Knoop to play the part of the reclusive author at book and other celebrity events. The Mola men’s best defence might be that collaborations are rarely rewarded in the publishing world and they aimed to explode that status quo. But they have made little of this, other than mentioning how they “combined their talents” to write their crime trilogy along with this new novel. Planeta, meanwhile, are expected to honour both the publishing deal for La Bestia and the lucrative associated TV adaptation of the Blanco trilogy under the Carmen Mola name. Filming starts in January. The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.","2021-10-26 05:02:08","","","theconversation"

"In fatal shooting, some political foes take aim at Baldwin","https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/in-fatal-shooting-some-political-foes-take-aim-at-baldwin-1.5638320","","['The Associated Press']","","Details are still emerging about how Alec Baldwin accidentally shot and killed a cinematographer on a New Mexico film set, but some political onlookers swiftly assigned guilt to one of Hollywood's most prominent liberals.","","2021-10-26 04:59:19","NEW YORK -- Details are still emerging about how Alec Baldwin accidentally shot and killed a cinematographer on a New Mexico film set, but some political onlookers swiftly assigned guilt to one of Hollywood's most prominent liberals. Right-wing pundits and politicians have long chafed at Baldwin's criticism of former U.S. President Donald Trump and his Trump parody on ""Saturday Night Live."" They wasted little time zeroing in on the actor who pulled the trigger. The hashtag #AlecForPrison ricocheted around Twitter. Within hours of the shooting, Ohio Republican Senate candidate J.D. Vance asked Twitter to let Trump back on the social media platform that banned him after the Capitol insurrection. ""We need Alec Baldwin tweets,"" Vance wrote. By Monday, Trump's oldest son was selling $28 T-shirts on his official website with the slogan ""Guns don't kill people, Alec Baldwin kills people."" The post was later removed. Gun violence has long divided the country, but the fact that some observers seemed to revel in Baldwin's role in the shooting added a political dimension to the tragedy. CNN host Jake Tapper on Sunday called Hutchins' death ""heartbreaking for normal people."" ""But there's something about our politics right now that is driving people away from our shared humanity,"" Tapper said. Court records provided some details about the death of Halyna Hutchins on the set of ""Rust"" near Santa Fe, New Mexico. Authorities have said that the assistant director, Dave Halls, handed the weapon to Baldwin and announced ""cold gun,"" indicating that the weapon was safe to use. In an affidavit released Sunday night, the film's director, Joel Souza, said Baldwin was rehearsing a scene in which he drew a revolver from his holster and pointed it toward the camera, which Hutchins and Souza were behind. Souza, who was wounded by the shot, said the scene did not call for the use of live rounds. It's not clear yet where the gun-handling protocol failed. Souza said the movie's guns were usually checked by armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed and then again by Halls. At least two people have aired doubts about Halls' safety record. In an email statement to The Associated Press, a producer for the movie ""Freedom's Path"" confirmed Monday that Halls was fired from the 2019 production after a crew member suffered a minor injury ""when a gun was unexpectedly discharged."" The producer, who asked not to be identified by name, wrote that Halls ""was removed from the set immediately."" Production did not resume until Halls was gone. Prop maker Maggie Goll on Sunday said she filed an internal complaint in 2019 over concerns about Halls' behavior on the set of Hulu's ""Into the Dark"" series. Goll said Halls disregarded safety protocols for weapons and pyrotechnics and tried to continue filming after the supervising pyrotechnician, who was diabetic, lost consciousness on set. Neither Gutierrez-Reed nor Halls have responded to requests for comment on the shooting. In the affidavit, cameraman Reid Russell said Baldwin had been careful with weapons. Russell was unsure whether the weapon was checked before it was handed to Baldwin. In the aftermath of Hutchins' death, many in the film industry have argued that real guns should be replaced entirely by computer-generated effects. ""There should not have been a loaded gun on set,"" actor Riley Keough wrote on Instagram. ""We don't need real guns, we can make replicas, and we have CGI. In my opinion, that is the issue here. Not Alec Baldwin."" And yet, as director Gigi Saul Guerrero observed, Baldwin has been the ""face to this tragic story."" The 63-year-old actor, a vocal advocate of gun-law reforms, has been widely mocked by the far-right on social media. ""Literally not one single thing that Alec Baldwin has said about Donald Trump and his supporters is going to age well,"" tweeted conservative commentator Candace Owens. U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, a Colorado Republican, cited a tweet of Baldwin's last year supporting Black Lives Matter protesters in which Baldwin said he was going to make T-shirts that read: ""My hands are up. Please don't shoot me!"" Wrote Boebert: ""Alec Baldwin, are these still available? Asking for a movie producer."" Boebert received widespread criticism. Actor George Takei said Boebert had ""no soul."" Actress Rosanna Arquette wrote: ""This was a tragic and horrible accident. Ms. Boebart and you should be ashamed of yourself politicizing it."" But Boebert stood by her tweet. ""You crazy Blue Checks want to take away our right to defend ourselves with a firearm, and know NOTHING about basic gun safety!"" Boebert wrote. ""If this was a conservative celebrity you'd be calling for his head."" The film's chief electrician, Serge Svetnoy, blamed producers for Hutchins' death in an emotional Facebook post Sunday. Svetnoy faulted ""negligence and unprofessionalism"" among those handling weapons on the set, and claimed producers hired an inexperienced armorer. ""I'm sure that we had the professionals in every department, but one -- the department that was responsible for the weapons,"" Svetnoy wrote. ""The person who should have checked this weapon before bringing it to the set did not do it. And the DEATH OF THE HUMAN IS THE RESULT!"" A spokesman for the film's production company, Rust Movie Productions LLC, has said it is cooperating with authorities and conducting an internal review. The company said it was halting production on the film but signaled it may resume in the future. Baldwin has said he is cooperating with the law enforcement investigation and described the shooting as a ""tragic accident."" ------ Associated Press writers Hillel Italie in New York and Lindsey Bahr in Pittsburgh contributed to this report. 00:16ET 26-10-21 RELATED IMAGES view larger image Actor Alec Baldwin speaks to reporters on the red carpet for the premiere of the film ""The Public"" during the 2018 Toronto International Film Festival in Toronto on Sunday, September 9, 2018.

He also suffered from kidney and liver problems, heart failure, neurological deterioration and alcohol and drug addictions. Gustavsson explains Matildas' harmony | 01:09 The late football great had been recovering in a private residence under the supervision of a seven-person medical team. The team members have already testified in the investigation to determine whether there was any neglect or malpractice in Maradona’s care.

Maradona “had no reason to go to a house when the doctors said he had to stay in a clinic,” Morla said, adding he believed his client had been “abandoned by his daughters.” “But one thing is moral responsibility and another is legal responsibility.” Maradona’s two older daughters, Dalma and Gianinna, were accused in August of harassing Morla online.","","foxsports"

"Neasham seeks change of luck with Eagle imports","https://www.news.com.au/sport/superracing/golden-eagle-imports-laws-of-indices-and-reve-de-vol-take-annabel-neashams-mind-off-cox-plate-disappointment/news-story/c80b70d63e56450034331bfc103af7fb","","","","Seven days is a long time in racing – just ask trainer Annabel Neasham.","","2021-10-26 04:57:00","Seven days is a long time in racing – just ask trainer Annabel Neasham. She’s spending this week in isolation ahead of Sydney’s second richest race, the $7.5m XXXX Golden Eagle (1500m) at Rosehill Gardens on Saturday where her stable is represented by talented imports, Laws Of Indices and Reve De Vol. This gives Neasham plenty of time to reflect on racing’s “rollercoaster” of emotions. Last Saturday at The Valley, Neasham’s dream of winning the Cox Plate with hot favourite Zaaki was over before dawn. Zaaki was found to have an elevated temperature and had to be withdrawn from the big race. Neasham still had Mo’unga in the Cox Plate and although he ran well to finish fourth the trainer left the course wondering what might have been. The uncompromising nature of this sport can be cruel at times but the very next day brings with it new hope and opportunity. For a woman so young – she hasn’t celebrated her 30th birthday yet – Neasham understands the ups and downs of life as a trainer. She also realises there is a necessity and expectation to get on with the job, there is no point dwelling on what happened last Saturday when there is a Golden Eagle to win. Neasham’s work ethic means she is probably feeling like that flighty two-year-old desperate to run as fast as possible on the training track such is her desperation to get back to her Warwick Farm stables. Instead, being at home in isolation means she must settle for the next best thing which is making and fielding countless phone calls from early morning until late into the evening as she co-ordinates her stable’s trackwork and raceday routines. But for a trainer renowned for her attention to detail, Neasham’s Golden Eagle ambitions rests with two horses she is still learning about – Laws Of Indices and Reve De Vol. “We have only had a short time to get to know these two horses so I suppose you could say it is a bit of guess work,” Neasham told The Daily Telegraph this week. “But they are both sound, working well and haven’t missed a beat.” Laws Of Indices and Reve De Vol arrived in Sydney last month and spent most of the time at Canterbury’s stabling and training quarantine facility before moving to Neasham’s Warwick Farm stables last Sunday. “I wouldn’t have minded keeping them at Canterbury for another week so we didn’t have to move them again but it is what it is,” Neasham said. “My staff tell me both horses have settled in well and they had their first gallop on the track (Tuesday morning).” Laws Of Indices and Reve De Vol – along with the John O’Shea-trained Maximal – are northern hemisphere-bred three-year-olds who provide the international presence to the Golden Eagle. The trio get a 1kg allowance and will carry 56.5kg against the southern hemisphere-bred four-year-olds in the rich Rosehill race. Neasham, born and raised in England, used her contacts overseas to source Laws Of Indices while she relied on the proven, expert eye of a trusted expatriate bloodstock agent to secure Reve De Vol. “We became aware of Laws Of Indices through our connections and started the negotiation process,” Neasham said. “Laws Of Indices’ (overseas) owners kept half and Aquis (Farm) came into the horse. “Stuart Boman found Reve De Vol. He buys some horses for OTI and he also found Zaaki for us as well.” The talented Laws Of Indices was a Group 2 Railway Stakes winner at The Curragh in Ireland as a two-year-old and has trained on this year to win the Group 1 Prix Jean Prat at France’s Deauville course in July. “Laws Of Indices is a Group 1 winner over 1400m and a lot of his form is on soft ground,” Neasham said. “But he did run fifth beaten two and a half lengths behind (multiple Group 1 winner) Poetic Flare in a (Irish 2000) Guineas trial on a good track. “He has got really good form and although he has never run over 1500m, he is a quality horse.” Neasham also has a good opinion of Reve De Vol, winner of two of his eight starts including the Listed Orby Stakes at The Curragh earlier this year. “Reve De Vol won his stakes race over 2000m and he was second in a Group 3 last start over 2000m,” Neasham said. “He is coming back in trip for the Golden Eagle but on his work he seems quite sharp. “I think he also has slightly better form on soft ground but he has been placed in a Group 2 on a good track over a mile. “He is reasonably versatile and if they go quick that will help him as he has a good turn of foot.” Neasham is also unveiling another English import, Top Ranked in the $1m Classique Legend Stakes (1300m) at the Golden Eagle meeting. Top Ranked, a striking grey stallion, has won six of his 12 starts in England including the Group 3 Superior Mile and Listed Doncaster Mile, and has been placed at Group 1 level. He has been working brilliantly at Canterbury and could be set to challenge Sydney’s super sprinters Masked Crusader and Eduardo on Saturday. “Top Ranked is a proper horse,’’ Neasham said. “He looks a serious horse with serious form and there is every chance he will be a top horse here. “The way he has jumped out and the way he is working we might kick him off in the Classique Legend Stakes then probably put him away for autumn.” Neasham comes out of isolation on Friday just in time to attend the Rosehill races.

Tesla becomes the fifth US company to join the $1 trillion club, after Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet. Its stock soared to a new record-high after it crossed $950 during the trading — up more than 9 per cent. The rally came after the US-based rental car company Hertz on Monday said it has ordered 100,000 Tesla vehicles (worth at least $4.2 billion) by the end of 2022 as part of an ambitious plan to electrify its fleet. The move includes new EV charging infrastructure across the company’s global operations. Beginning in early November, customers will be able to rent a Tesla Model 3 at Hertz airport and neighbourhood locations in US major markets and select cities in Europe. Hertz also is installing thousands of chargers throughout its location network. Customers who rent a Tesla Model 3 will have access to 3,000 Tesla supercharging stations throughout the US and Europe, the company said. Earlier, Tesla hiked prices for all four of its in-production vehicles. The base Model 3 and Model Y electric vehicles are each priced $2,000 higher, at $43,990 and $56,990, respectively. In addition, the base Model S and Model X vehicles will each cost $5,000 more, at $94,990 and $104,990, reports electrek.co. Global EV sales skyrocketed 200 per cent in the last year and will likely continue to grow with commitments from global automakers to increase EV sales.

"Brexit: Twenty-fold rise in health checks on imports from Britain","https://www.irishtimes.com/business/brexit-twenty-fold-rise-in-health-checks-on-imports-from-britain-1.4710130?localLinksEnabled=false","","['Simon Carswell']","","About one consignment in every 200 rejected due mostly to incomplete paperwork","","2021-10-26 04:55:00","There has been a 20-fold increase in the number of consignments of food and plant products and live animals being processed by health inspectors at Irish ports since Brexit , new data shows. Department of Agriculture inspectors and health officials are processing about 1,700 consignments a week compared with less than 100 a week last year under new border controls covering sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) checks on goods being imported from Britain. New figures from the Department of Agriculture show that about one in every 200 of these consignments have been rejected. In more than half of these cases it is because there is inadequate, incorrect or missing paperwork. The department said that out of 53,148 consignments processed since the start of the year, less than 1 per cent, or 262 have been rejected. The bulk of the consignments requiring processing by the inspectors – more than 47,000 – are coming through Dublin Port , with a further 2,300 coming through Rosslare Europort. Hazel Sheridan , head of the department’s import controls division, said the 53,000 consignments processed so far this year compares with about 4,000 to 5,000 last year before Brexit. Of the weekly consignments, about 1,000 are products of animal origin, about 300 are plants or plant products, 100-200 are live animals, and pesticides are in single digits. There has been “huge change” at Dublin Port as a result of Brexit, she told a webinar last week. On the customs side, the Revenue Commissions reported a marginal increase in the percentage of goods arriving from Britain being “green-routed” and not requiring post-Brexit physical checks. Just over 289,700 freight vehicle movements arrived from Britain through Dublin Port and Rosslare Europort during the first nine months of the year, new Revenue figures show. The Revenue said 85 per cent were green-routed without the need for any additional interaction with customs officials or any other State agency – up by a percentage point on the figure for the first six months of the year. The number of freight vehicles “red-routed” for a physical examination or inspection fell by a percentage point to 3 per cent. The number of lorries “orange-routed” – meaning they required a documentary check or similar control – remained at 12 per cent for the nine months Goods arriving into the Republic from Britain have fallen subject to obligatory EU “third country” checks since January 1st when the UK’s departure from the EU came into effect. State officials have said that in addition to incomplete paperwork, the failure of businesses to give the required 24-hour notice for the arrival of goods subject to SPS checks was causing delays. Importers and hauliers have complained about delays associated with the increased post-Brexit bureaucracy and documentation, saying that it eats into the regulated driving time of hauliers. “There is a huge amount of effort and time and minutiae of detail that goes into the consignments that get through. Why can’t it be simplified?” said Eugene Drennan , president of the Irish Road Haulage Association . The Revenue was unable to provide figures for the average wait time for lorries arriving into the ports, saying the time can vary and depends on whether a mandatory inspection or more information or documentation is required for each consignment. “Mandatory check for certain types of goods are simply a reality of trading with a third country, including Great Britain,” said the Revenue. Obligatory checks on goods of animal or plant origin may take longer, with inspection times varying depending on the size of the load and the type of good, it said. Revenue customs officials and officials from other State agency officials have been working on site at Dublin Port and Rosslare Europort on a 24/7 basis. The Revenue said that it continues to work with individual hauliers and businesses “to resolve any avoidable delays where they arise”.","https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4710128.1635176481!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_490/image.jpg","irishtimes"
"‘Can I release equity in home to help ex-husband buy a place?’","https://www.irishtimes.com/business/personal-finance/can-i-release-equity-in-home-to-help-ex-husband-buy-a-place-1.4707939?localLinksEnabled=false","","['Dominic Coyle']","","Q&A: Bigger issue seems to be why his choice of accommodation should be your problem","","2021-10-26 04:55:00","If I own a large house with ancillary buildings which generate rent with no mortgage in my sole name, can I realise some of the equity in the house and give my ex-husband the money to buy himself a nice house? I generate income from my job and rentals but I’ve missed payments for utilities and local property tax sporadically over the split-up time. Everything is paid up to date now. I’ve no savings, my tax affairs are sorted but I desperately need to move on with my life. I am living in Airbnb s and on people’s sofas every weekend for the past year as my ex comes to the home to be with the children. It’s miserable for me. My ex makes a good income but rents a room in a house, saying he has nowhere to bring the children. The house sustains the children and if we sell it, the children and I will have very very little income and the children would be devastated. Banks all tell me different things, I’m scared of vulture funds and I just don’t know what is for the best. I know it’s a first-world problem and I should be grateful, but we are all so unhappy being stuck. Is there a way we can keep the main house and get another without the mortgage repayments being crazy – if I could even get a mortgage. I’m 49 and part-time self-employed. Ms A O’N, email It sounds like life is becoming a little overwhelming but I’m not sure equity release is going to provide an answer for you. More importantly, I’m not sure you should be shouldering this as your problem. There are a few different ways to release equity in your home. The most common approach is simply to remortgage the property to gain access to funds. A mortgage is generally the lowest cost loan you can secure but it is still a loan and you need to be in a position to meet the repayments. Given that your income comes from a part-time self-employed role and rent, and that you have a spotty credit record , I can see you having issues getting a mortgage. People in a lot stronger position are being turned down by the banks who are not simply risk-averse right not but downright risk-phobic. However, you are far from the first person who has struggled to keep up with bills as they go through the trauma of a marriage break-up. You say your financial affairs are now in order with all payments up to date. Assuming there were no credit issues before the break-up, it should be possible to address the credit issues in any mortgage application. If you do want to pursue a mortgage, I would suggest going through a broker who would be better versed in how to present a case with: irregular income, a less than blue-chip credit rating and tell you which mortgage provider to approach in that scenario – but I still have strong doubts that it will succeed. There are two other, more formal equity release products in the Irish market but they are both designed for older people. One is a lifetime loan provided by Spry Finance/ Seniors Money which entered the Irish market at the beginning of the year. It allows you to borrow a percentage of the value of your home – the percentage you can borrow rises with your age. You pay nothing on the loan during your lifetime, but the interest – which is higher than you would pay on a normal mortgage – rolls up and the whole sum is repayable when you die. But that debt can grow faster than you would expect, possibly consuming the entire value of your home when you are dead and leaving nothing for your estate. The other formal equity release model is something called residential reversion . Where you still own your property under a lifetime loan, under reversion you are actually selling a stake in the property. And because the lender, in this case a group called Home Plus , is not going to get access to the property for a while they will only give you a fraction of the true value of the property. The company chief executive recently gave an example of a couple aged 67 and 70 looking to release 25 per cent of the value of their home. To do so, his company would take ownership of 72 per cent of the property. These are regulated products and the companies are up front about the cost but, in reality, this should be borrowers of last resort for people. In any case, you won’t qualify for a few years. While some equity release products in other markets are open to people from the age of 50, the two operating in Ireland require you to be older – at least 60 years of age for the lifetime loan and 55 for residential reversion. And the younger you are, the worse value you will get from these lenders. The final option is to sell part of the property to a family member or friend. But there’s nothing like a dispute over an illiquid asset to test a friendship or family relations, so you would both need to be very clear about the commitments made, and ensure there is comprehensive and legally watertight arrangement governing what should happen if either party wants to exit the arrangement. But that brings me to the bigger issue: why is this your problem? Clearly, I don’t have access to whatever legal or other formal agreement exists between you and your ex-husband but your letter suggest that you are putting yourself out because he cannot or will not make arrangements to accommodate his time with the children. You say he has a good income. These things are always relative and it may be the case that he will not qualify for a mortgage on a home anywhere near enough to the children to be able to have them over regularly but it is his choice to settle for renting a room in this other house. He knows that doing so automatically rules out having his children over. That, to me, appears to be his problem. It does not seem reasonable that you are in a position where you cannot stay in your own house while he exercises his rights of access to the children. That you are forced to find a friend’s couch or an Airbnb every weekend seems entirely unreasonable and I cannot see a family court considering that a reasonable approach to visitation. I am only going on your letter, but the division of financial assets seems to be that you got the family home and there is no mention of maintenance. That being the arrangement, the idea that you should either have to sell that property or otherwise mortgage it to fund a house purchase by him seems daft. Clearly, if you cannot be in the same house as him, relations are very fragile so approaching your husband to suggest he put in place more realistic arrangement may prove counterproductive. In that case, I think you really will need to consider consulting a solicitor to see if a better structure can be put in place to allow your ex-husband see the children without imposing such an unreasonable situation on you.

KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 26 ― Under fire, Youth and Sports Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Faizal Azumu today defended his remarks to national diver Datuk Pandelela Rinong who recently spoke up about sexual harassment incidents she endured from national coaches in the past.Seeking to allay public criticism, he said his remarks questioning why the Olympian only spoke up about the issue that happened many years ago had been taken out of context by the media.“Of course the government views the matter seriously, what more if acts beyond sexual harassment had indeed taken place which were perpetrated by coaches or sport officers.“And what I said in a press conference yesterday, that we have to obtain a full and detailed explanation from Datuk Pandelela herself and those allegedly involved in the acts, may have been taken out of context by the media.“So I tried to obtain a fuller understanding before taking relevant action,” he said in the Dewan Rakyat this morning.The Bersatu deputy president was replying to Muar MP Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman who wanted to know the government’s stance on the issue.Now an independent lawmaker, Syed Saddiq was the youth and sports minister during Pakatan Harapan’s 22-month rule.Puchong MP Gobind Singh Deo then stood up and said Ahmad Faizal was unfit to be a minister for questioning the timing of Pandelela’s revelation.The DAP lawmaker asked Ahmad Faisal if he was aware that Malaysia has no time limit when it comes to prosecuting criminal acts.“Tuan Speaker, actually this minister is unfit to be the youth and sports minister for failing to give athletes support.“I want to ask the minister whether he is aware that there is no time limitation in criminal law. So if there is a complaint, even though it has long happened, there should be action taken,” Gobind said.“I agree wholeheartedly with what YB has said. I do understand that there is no time limit,” Ahmad Faizal repliee before Petaling Jaya MP Maria Chin Abdullah cut in.“If you agree, why was no action taken?” she asked.Ahmad Faizal told Maria that action is being taken.But he reiterated that he needed to hear from all of those involved before action can be taken.Pandelela took to Twitter last night explaining her recent vocal stance against making jokes about rape following the controversial airing of a talk show programme on national TV in which a popular local actor disclosed his lusty fantasies while filming a rape scene.She said she spoke up to create awareness of the ongoing abuses and to show solidarity with other victims so nobody will ever forget what they endured.In an October 21 tweet, Pandelela said she had to endure sexual jokes and comments from one of her coaches for seven years.She recalled how she once told the coach off after she had enough of his lewd jokes, only to be bullied by the same coach who was later charged with raping another athlete.Pandalela did not name anyone in her tweets but in 2017, Chinese national Huang Qiang, who was a coach in the national diving programme, was charged in the Sessions Court with raping a national diver, who was aged 20 then, in a dry gym at the National Aquatics Centre, Bukit Jalil Sports Complex in Sri Petaling.He was later acquitted after the prosecution withdrew its appeal in the Court of Appeal.Following that, the national diving setup was disbanded and former head coach Yang Zhuliang was relieved of his duties.","2021-10-26 04:54:24","","","malaymail"

I have information that Sameer Wankhede, through two private individuals, is intercepting calls. My phones were also tapped.

""The way things are mentioned in the anonymous letter are related to inside matters, hence there is a scope to believe that it is genuine. I am not saying that punish them immediately, but this certainly should be inquired,"" Nawab Malik further said. Nawab Malik also said that Sameer Wankhede snatched away the job of a deserving Dalit by using forged documents to get his job. ""The birth certificate I tweeted is original.

Individually, BoB rallied 6.5 per cent to Rs 102.85 on the back of heavy volumes. The stock of state-owned lender has outperformed the market by surging 35 per cent in the past one month, as against the S&P BSE Sensex, which has gained 2.5 per cent during the same period. At 09:59 am, BoB was trading 5 per cent higher at Rs 101.40, relative to the Sensex's 0.66 per cent gain. A combined 46.2 million equity shares had changed hands on the counter on the NSE and BSE till the time of writing of this report. Currently, the bank has an m-cap of Rs 52,515 crore, BSE data shows. Shares of PNB, too, hit a 52-week high of Rs 47.40, up 5.5 per cent on the BSE in the intra-day trade today. The bank's m-cap stood at Rs 51,641 crore, data shows. In the past one month, the stock has surged 25 per cent. On October 6, 2021, Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) affirmed the 'Ba1' long-term local and foreign currency deposit ratings of BoB, PNB, Canara Bank and Union Bank of India, as well as their 'b1' BCAs. Their rating outlook has been changed to stable from negative. ""The affirmation of ratings and BCAs, and change in outlook to stable from negative, reflect the fact that despite the significant economic challenges since the onset of the pandemic, their asset quality has only deteriorated modestly while capital has improved,"" Moody's said. It added: Corporate asset quality has improved as legacy issues have been resolved while deterioration in retail asset quality was relatively moderate. Asset quality will further improve if economic activity continues to normalize. The core equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratios of these four banks were higher at end June 2021 compared to March 2020. Capital increased as all four raised equity from capital markets. The ability to access equity capital markets is a key credit positive as it reduces the dependence on the government for capital, according to the agency's analysis. Profitability will improve over the next 12-18 months as credit costs will decline in line with a lower nonperforming loans (NPL) formation rate. Funding and liquidity remain the strongest parts of their credit profiles, as reflected in high share of retail deposits and low cost of funding. Moody's continues to assume a very high level of government support in their ratings, leading to unchanged three notch uplift in their deposit ratings. These four banks rank among the seven biggest banks in India, with deposit market shares ranging between 6-7 per cent. Their systemic importance is further enhanced by the strong links to the government, it said. Meanwhile, the stock of Canara Bank, too, hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 207.15, up 2.6 per cent, having rallied 31 per cent in the past one month. Union Bank India, too, gained 2.6 per cent at Rs 49.60 in the intra-day trade today. The stock had hit a 52-week high of Rs 51.70 on October 21, 2021.

On Monday, Oct. 25, Ireland took to her Instagram Story to criticize Candace after the conservative pundit suggested in a since-deleted tweet that it could be seen as ""poetic justice"" that Ireland's dad, Alec Baldwin , accidentally misfired a prop gun last week on the set of the movie Rust . The firearm discharge fatally shot cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and injured director Joel Souza on Thursday, Oct. 21. Ireland shared a photo of Candace, in addition to tagging her, and wrote, ""You are the most disgusting, hateful, cancerous human being I've ever come across. Regardless of your foul opinions most of the time, the fact that you would disrespect the life of a woman who was accidentally and tragically killed....Shame on you."" The 26-year-old model then posted Candace's previous tweet to her Story, which read, ""Alec Baldwin spent 4 years dedicated to painting Donald Trump and his supporters as evil murderers. What has happened to Alec would be an example of poetic justice if it weren't for the actual innocent people that were murdered by him. Pray for their families. So sad."" Ireland added, ""Yup... I'm going to go ahead and take that Instagram break. I am ashamed to [breathe] the same air as this woman."" She went on to post additional messages, writing that Candace's tweets were ""hurting people"" and adding that anyone following the model should ""hit that unfollow button if you're trying to defame my father and tweet such horrific statements about this tragic situation. It breaks my heart that people are so hatefully ignorant..."" A short time later, Candace took to her own Instagram Story and wrote, ""Ireland Baldwin is in my DMs because I don't feel bad for her psychopathic father. Feel bad for the victim, not Alec. He has always been a predator in Hollywood who was given a pass."" Candace also shared screenshots that appeared to show heated direct messages that the two had exchanged. However, the two of them apparently talked things out through their direct messages before ending up on better terms. Ireland posted a screenshot appearing to show each of them wishing the other a ""peaceful evening,"" with Ireland adding to her followers, ""[Sometimes] having an actual conversation can go a long way..."" On Friday, Oct. 22, Alec broke his silence about the tragedy by tweeting, ""There are no words to convey my shock and sadness regarding the tragic accident that took the life of Halyna Hutchins, a wife, mother and deeply admired colleague of ours."" He added that he was ""cooperating with the police investigation"" and was in touch with Halyna's husband, Matthew Hutchins . Later that day, Matthew expressed his grief on social media, tweeting that his wife's ""legacy is too meaningful to encapsulate in words."" He also told the New York Post that Alec had been ""very supportive."" Shortly after the incident, the film's production company, Rust Movie Productions LLC, sent its ""deepest condolences."" Producers have since stated that production on the film has halted indefinitely amid ongoing investigations. No charges have been filed related to the incident, and witnesses continue to be interviewed by detectives, according to the Santa Fe County Sheriff's office. Daily Pop","","eonline"

Brast said outside court that Abulaban, 29, is a TikTok star known as JinnKid, with more than 940,000 followers on the social media app. His account features comedy skits and impersonations of the character Tony Montana from the 1983 film “Scarface.” Abulaban’s attorney did not comment on the allegations during the hearing. Police identified the victims as Ana Abulaban, 28, of San Diego and Rayburn Cadenas Barron, 29, of National City. About two dozen family members and friends of the two victims packed the courtroom. Several of them sobbed as Brast shared details about last Thursday's killings in San Diego's East Village neighborhood. Brast said Ali Abulaban confessed to detectives and accused his wife of cheating, although the prosecutor said she believes Barron was a friend. According to Brast, Ana Abulaban had asked her husband to move out Oct. 18. He checked into a hotel. Three days later, Brast said, Ali Abulaban sneaked back into the apartment and trashed it while his wife was gone. He also installed the listening app on his daughter’s iPad. Hours later, Abulaban was listening to the app when he heard his wife and a man talking and giggling, Brast said, and he raced back to the high-rise. Security camera video showed him running out of the elevator to the apartment. Brast said Abulaban shot Barron three times before shooting his wife in her head. Abulaban then called his mother and confessed, Brast said. After he picked up his daughter, he called police while driving and they arrested him 45 minutes later. His daughter was in the vehicle. Judge Kimberlee Lagotta ordered Abulaban jailed without bail. The judge also issued a protective order that requires Abulaban to stay away from his daughter, who is being cared for by family.

In a week or so, Brian and Troy Snitker will differ in that only one will have earned a 2021 World Series ring.","2021-10-26 04:39:14","HOUSTON — Like father, like son. For now, at least. In a week or so, Brian and Troy Snitker will differ in that only one will have earned a 2021 World Series ring. Brian Snitker, the Braves’ manager, and his son, Troy, the Astros’ co-hitting coach, are the First Family of this Fall Classic, facing off for Thanksgiving dinner bragging rights. “Quite honestly, tomorrow at 7:09 or whatever, he’s going to want to kick my ass,” Brian Snitker said Monday at a Minute Maid Park press conference. “Obviously, we probably both feel the same way in terms of that this is about the guys that are playing, this is about the teams that are playing,” Troy Snitker said. “I know he feels that his guys have overcome so much to get to this point and are very deserving. I obviously feel the same way.” Troy grew up with his dad climbing the Braves’ organizational chart, managing eight different minor league affiliates and working as a big-league coach under five different skippers. As much of a Braves supporter as he became, though, “My first tee-ball team was the Astros,” he said. “So at 5, 6, those were the first uniforms I ever wore.” Many questions concerned how Ronnie Snitker, Brian’s wife and Troy’s mother, would handle this intra-family matchup. “I don’t know that she knows what she’s getting into,” Brian said. Said Troy: “I definitely think she’s a work in progress for how she’s going to deal with all this. I don’t think any of us know.” The one certainty, with Tuesday’s Game 1 approaching, was the mutual pride the father and son hold for each other. “I know it was a dream of his to be able to do this and be able to manage in the big leagues, and I think he always knew that he could do it,” Troy Snitker said of his father, whom the Braves tabbed as their interim manager in 2016 at age 60, “but I definitely think there was a point where he probably didn’t think it was going to happen anymore, which makes this very special.” Said Brian of his son, who refused to take a job with the Braves: “I’m very proud of him. He went about it the right way. He’s always been just a really hard, dedicated worker. He got his foot in the door, like a lot of us have over the years, and it’s just where he’s at.”","https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/snitker-family-world-series.png","nypost"

Ms Haugen said Facebook’s outlook “hides the difference” between children using the platform and adults.

Officials and elected representatives, who are closely monitoring developments in Myanmar, said that continued clashes between the Army and the civilian groups there forced the people to cross over and seek refuge in the Indian state. An MP from Mizoram said that there are a large number of people waiting across the border to take shelter in Mizoram, while more are likely to come after their harvest season. Data maintained by the CID shows that the Myanmar nationals mostly take shelter in six Mizoram districts – Champhai, Lawngtlai, Siaha, Serchhip, Hnahthial and Saitual – with Champhai housing the highest number of around 6,000. As many as 1,630 people are in Aizawl. Security and district officials, legislators and others said that the distressed refugees from Myanmar have crossed the Tiau river in small country boats to take shelter in the border villages. ""The river Tiau (which flows along the Champhai district in eastern Mizoram and divides India and Myanmar) was crossed by the refugees in small boats with the help of local Mizos,"" a Mizoram NGO leader said. ""The hapless people with no option to survive the Army onslaught took shelter in our side and the Mizo villagers on humanitarian ground provided them food and shelter,"" he added. Mizoram shares 510 km international border with Myanmar and 318 km with Bangladesh. Besides Mizoram's most influential NGO Young Mizo Association, various churches including Presbyterian, Baptist and Roman Catholic are, on humanitarian grounds, providing food, essentials, clothing and shelter to the refugees since March. On a number of occasions, Chief Minister Zoramthanga has urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to provide humanitarian assistance to Myanmar nationals as his State is witnessing a continuing influx of refugees from the neighbouring country. Mizoram Planning Board Vice Chairman H. Rammawi, who is closely dealing with the Myanmar refugee affairs, said that the Chief Minister, besides writing letters, has also talked to Prime Minister and Home Minister Amit Shah over phone on a number of occasions, requested them to extend humanitarian assistance to the Myanmar refugees. ""The Central government is yet to respond positively and has remained silent on the issue,"" he said, adding that he has been in constant touch with the External Affairs Ministry and the Home Ministry, and the people of Mizoram are deeply disappointed over the Centre's silence and ""apathetic"" attitude towards the distressed people from Myanmar. He said that the State is now reeling under a severe financial crisis, limited infrastructure of health and other services and non-availability of required manpower, as the COVID pandemic has also badly affected the State's overall situation. Officer on Special Duty (OSD) to the Chief Minister Rosangzuala is regularly in touch with Central ministers and officials to provide financial assistance and other support to the refugees. An MHA advisory, recently sent out to the four north-eastern States, Mizoram, Manipur, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh, which share 1,640-km unfenced border with Myanmar, said that the states and Union Territories have no power to grant ""refugee"" status to any foreigner, and India is not a signatory to the UN Refugee Convention of 1951 and its 1967 Protocol.

The report coincides with concerns that some EU lawmakers who are reviewing the Digital Markets Act here (DMA) proposed by EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager may be lenient towards cloud computing companies. Amazon’s Amazon Web Services was the leading provider in the second quarter of this year, followed by Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, market research company Statista found. Others include IBM Cloud, Alibaba Cloud, Salesforce and Oracle . https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png The study was prepared by Frederic Jenny, chairman of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Competition Committee, in his personal capacity for trade body CISPE (Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe). “The DMA does say that cloud infrastructure can come within the ambit of the DMA but it is not obvious that all the suppliers are covered, for example it doesn’t seem that Google Cloud qualifies under the DMA as a gatekeeper or IBM Cloud or Salesforce,” Jenny told Reuters in an interview. He said potential anti-competitive practices by some companies could include unfair pricing techniques or making it technically difficult for users to move to a rival. Jenny said the study interviewed some 25 companies that use cloud computing services, a number of which cited issues such as unfair licence terms that force customers to pay again to use software they already own when they move to a competitor. Respondents were also concerned about providers bundling software products with their cloud infrastructure to make rival products either less attractive or more expensive. Google, Oracle and SAP declined to comment. Microsoft and Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment. EU lawmakers have to thrash out the draft DMA with EU countries before it becomes law, possibly in 2023.","","indianexpress"

Dr Pallavi Prasad, fertility consultant at NOVA IVF Fertility, Bengaluru, says pregnancy in women with breast cancer or those who have been treated for it, is difficult. How do cancer treatments affect fertility? “Cancer treatments are necessary as they are lifesaving, but the treatment can hamper one’s reproductive organs and glands, thereby resulting in infertility. Fertility changes can be temporary or permanent,” she says, adding, it is advisable to consult your medical team to learn what to expect based on your treatment.

If you are still receiving treatment such as chemotherapy, hormone therapy, or targeted therapy, consult your doctor before attempting to conceive. (Photo: Getty/Thinkstock) Could breast cancer treatment harm the unborn child? If you are still receiving treatment for breast cancer, such as chemotherapy, hormone therapy, or targeted therapy, consult your doctor before attempting to conceive. These drugs have the potential to harm a developing foetus, it is best to postpone pregnancy until all treatment is completed. It’s also important to remember that stopping the treatment too soon increases the chances of the cancer growing or coming back, the doctor warns.

According to studies, there is less milk production in that breast, as well as structural changes that can make breastfeeding painful or difficult for the baby to latch onto the breast. Despite this, many women are able to breastfeed. It is critical that you consult with your doctor before attempting to breast-feed. Some drugs can enter the breast milk and have an effect on the baby. “Since many breast cancers are oestrogen-sensitive, there has been concern that high hormone levels caused by pregnancy may increase the chances of cancer returning in women who have already had breast cancer. Pregnancy, on the other hand, doesn’t always raise the risk of cancer recurrence after successful treatment,” says the doctor. 📣 For more lifestyle news, follow us on Instagram | Twitter | Facebook and don’t miss out on the latest updates!","","indianexpress"
"This Aussie Animation Studio Has Made a New Horror Comedy About Murder Drones","https://www.kotaku.com.au/2021/10/murder-drones-animated-series-glitch/","['Entertainment', 'animation', 'au', 'entertainment', 'murder drones']","['Lauren Rouse']","","Sydney-based studio Glitch Productions is following up the success of Meta Runner with a new animated horror-comedy titled Murder Drones. The post This Aussie Animation Studio Has Made a New Horror Comedy About Murder Drones appeared first on Kotaku Australia.","It’s only a matter of time before our robot companions gain murderous tendencies and now a new Aussie series is putting those fears into animation. Sydney-based studio Glitch Productions is launching a new online series titled Murder Drones which is about, well obviously, killer drones. The story takes place on a dystopian mining planet where humanity has perished and the AI worker robots who were left behind must defend themselves from the vampiric “disassembly drones” that are devoted to destroying all machine life. Murder Drones is a push into darker territory for Glitch Productions, which is the studio behind popular animated series like Meta Runner and Sunset Paradise. Image: Glitch Productions “We’ve seen our fans have an appetite for darker stories and that’s been great for us because it means we can explore more mature concepts that you might not associate with 3D animation,” executive producer Luke Lerdwichagul said in a media release. But despite being pinned as a dystopian comedy-horror, it’s not all doom and gloom. There are some heart-warming elements to Murder Drones, such as when rogue teen helper bot Uzi befriends N, the optimistic murder drone who has been sent to destroy her. The trailer has gained over a million views since its release, proving we’re all pretty hungry for some murderous robots. That being said, the design and style of Murder Drones manage to make those murderous robots look pretty damn cute. The 3D animation series was created entirely in Unreal Engine, which has resulted in some seriously stunning visuals. The team behind Murder Drones includes Liam Vickers (CliffSide) as showrunner, writer and director, as well as Kevin and Luke Lerdwichagul as executive producers. The voice cast features talents like Elsie Lovelock (Meta Runner), Michael Kovach (Hazbin Hotel) and Sean Chiplock (Breath of the Wild). Image: Glitch Productions “Murder Drones captures our voice as an animation studio, it’s the kind of series we want people to see and think ‘that’s from Glitch’,” Kevin Lerdwichagul said. “It’s fun and wacky but at the same time, there’s this dark suspense in everything. One moment you’re laughing at a silly gag and the next you’re watching a robot get dismembered. That’s what makes it different.” Murder Drones is an eight-episode series and releases its first episode on YouTube on October 29, 2021.

The Prime Minister revealed Australia’s ‘plan’ to reach net zero by 2050 ahead of the international climate change conference in Glasgow next week. In fact, the PM said ‘plan’ at least 80 times during the whole press conference. And that’s without counting how many times he said it in Question Time. Under the plan, more than $20 billion will be invested in “low emissions technologies”, including carbon capture and storage, by 2030. It is expected to generate between $60 billion and $100 billion in “co-investment”. A “new priority” to deliver “ultra-low-cost solar” power is also included in the plan. Time Is Now is part of news.com.au’s partnership with the Monash Climate Change Communication Research Hub, looking at the impacts of climate change across Australia by 2050 Yet despite repeating that word over and over, the main question being asked is how we get there. As the PM was only too willing to repeat today, this was just about releasing the ‘plan’. When asked when the actual modelling would be released, he did say that yes, it will come ‘eventually’. “Did you say a moment ago you would release the modelling,” the PM was asked. “Eventually, yes,” he replied. “It is not a plan at any cost,” Mr Morrison said. “There is no blank cheques here. It will not shut down our coal or gas production or exports. It will not impact households, businesses or the broader economy with new costs or taxes imposed by the initiatives that we are undertaking. “It will not cost jobs, not in farming, mining or gas because what we are doing in this plan is positive things.” He revealed that emissions are set to be reduced by 30-35 per cent on 2005 levels by 2030 — an increase from the previous prediction of 26-28 per cent. He also stressed that Australia needed to follow the middle ground of what’s good for the country and what’s good for emissions. “In this debate there are those who will say we will be ruined if we don’t and we will be ruined if we do. What’s important for Australia is we set that middle course and that’s what my Government’s doing,” he said. He continually stressed the Coalition’s plan to tackle climate change would not involve a tax on carbon emissions like Labor previously introduced. “Technologies not taxes,” the PM said in a slogan that all Australians will hear many times before the next election. As his plan revealed today, a lot of predicted emissions will be achieved through technology. So much so, that 15 per cent of the planned emission reduction is earmarked for technologies not even invented yet. For now, the PM has revealed a climate plan he hopes will be enough to win him the next election. Mr Morrison was quick to point out that Labor is yet to reveal its climate change policy. “There is an alternative plan which is not our plan. To be fair, there isn’t, because they haven’t said what it is yet under the Labor Party,” he said. “They have a target without a plan. They have got not even a target for 2030 let alone a plan for 2050.” University of NSW climate scientist Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick said the plan was “pretty ambiguous”. “Sure, they’ve said they’ll commit to net zero by 2050, but where are the new policies? There seems to be talk of some investment in greener energy solutions, which is great, but there’s also a focus on current industries being ‘cleaner’ versions of themselves - how are they going to achieve this?” Backlash to the Coalition’s net zero plan was swift (unsurprisingly) from the Greens and Labor. Greens leader Adam Bandt said the PM would be called a “joke” by other world leaders at the climate change conference in Glasgow next week. “This is a climate fraud. There is no new money, no new policies, and more coal and gas,” he said. “It’s got 2030 targets that will cook our kids and more coal and gas. This so-called climate plan fails to do what is needed to protect the Australian people and our way of life.” And Labor leader Anthony Albanese was just as scathing. “We haven’t seen the modelling, and we haven’t had the detail. Because there is net zero modelling, net zero legislation and net zero unity,” he said. It is hypocritical for Labor to complain about a lack of detail, when it hasn’t revealed how it’ll act on climate change yet either. But it does reveal a problem the PM will continue to face. Until Mr Morrison can actually reveal more details and the modelling that will get us to net zero by 2050, he can expect to keep facing tough questions about his ‘plan’.

"Wimborne 27-12 Dorchester: Injuries and cards hinder county town","https://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/news/19671791.wimborne-27-12-dorchester-injuries-cards-hinder-county-town/?ref=rss","","","","DORCHESTER were on the wrong end of a 27-12 scoreline at Wimborne in the Tribute Southern Counties South.","","2021-10-26 04:30:00","DORCHESTER were on the wrong end of a 27-12 scoreline at Wimborne in the Tribute Southern Counties South. However, there was much to be cheerful about in Dorchester’s performance. Already hit by some last-minute unavailability issues, Dorchester got off to the worst possible start, losing full-back Liam Moss to injury in the very first minute. Following a complete reshuffling of the back division and a little lack of concentration as players tried to settle, it was no surprise when Wimborne found a gap in the defence and opened the scoring with a converted try. Far from disheartened the visitors then began to settle and had the better of the rest of the first half, with the forwards looking impressive at scrum time. READ MORE : Dorchester unveil bespoek ale in brewery collaboration With a certain try missed due to a forward pass followed by a missed penalty, Dorchester were looking very strong. A string of penalties close to the Wimborne try line brought a team warning to the opposition, and the country town’s impressive young scrum-half Freddie Charles showed great strength to force his way over the line from close range. The conversion went wide but Dorchester were now in the ascendancy and when Josh Hosford barrelled his way over under the posts close to the end of the first half, they took the lead. Callum King added the extras and with a minute to go Dorchester led 12-7. Unfortunately, Dorchester failed to deal with the kick, giving away a soft penalty and allowing Wimborne to go into the break just two points behind. With the wind at their backs, Wimborne started the second half on the front foot, crossing for two early unconverted tries as the visitors were again caught napping, finding themselves 20-12 behind. Dorchester were still well in the game however until they lost hooker Scott Clark to a yellow card and shortly afterwards Andy Dowell to red for a dangerous tackle. With a two-man deficit, much to their credit Dorchester defended manfully and only conceded one converted try while two men short. It was then the hosts’ turn to lose a man to the bin following a tip tackle. With the game now 14 against 14, Dorchester dominated the final 10 minutes but despite creating several good chances were unable to close the gap to pick up a losing bonus point. Defeat leaves Dorchester one off the bottom of the table but with two winnable games coming up against mid-table opposition starting on Saturday at home to Avonvale. In Tribute Dorset & Wilts Two South action, Dorchester’s A XV were awarded a bonus-point win due to East Dorset Dockers being unable to raise a team to travel. This lifts the side to second in the table behind Lytchett Minster who have played one more game. Elsewhere, the combined Dorchester Weymouth & Portland Ladies team, Ridgeway Roses, fell to a 29-5 defeat to Oakmeadians in a game cut short due to injury.","https://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/resources/images/13137283/","dorsetecho"

The Xperia PRO-I, a capital I for “Imaging” and not the Roman numeral, has been groomed to appeal to the growing number of “pro” vloggers and amateur videographers proliferating on the Internet these days. It is, of course, also a solid high-end smartphone for 2021 and thankfully doesn’t have a mind-blowing price tag like its predecessor earlier this year. As far as smartphone specs go, the Xperia PRO-I is like a rehash of the Xperia 1 III and almost feels like a rebrand of the 2021 Sony flagship. They share almost everything in common, like the Snapdragon 888 with 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, down to the 6.5-inch 4K OLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate. The same 4,500 mAh powers the phone and, unlike Samsung and Apple, comes with a 30W in the box. There are, of course, some differences, like in the design of the camera array, but the biggest one is the main imaging sensor. Although still at 12 megapixels, the new sensor is boasted to be the first in the smartphone segment to use a 1.0-inch Exmor RS sensor that’s paired with a BIONZ X imaging processor, bringing it close to Sony’s Alpha cameras and, specifically, its CyberShot RX100 VII that uses the same sensor. Sony makes sure to note that the dual-aperture lens is also special with a 24mm ZEISS Tessar Optics and T* anti-reflective coating. While Sony can talk endlessly about the phone’s camera hardware, part of the formula for success will be in the phone’s camera software. For the Xperia PRO-I, Sony added a new Videography Pro feature that brings the same level of fine control that still photographers enjoy in the usual “Pro” camera mode, except for recording videos. There’s also a distinct Cinematography Pro mode that offers preset color settings, a 21:9 recording ratio, and other video-making features. Once all the recording is done, creators can edit and share those videos right from the device as well. To emphasize the Xperia PRO-I’s vlogging mission, Sony is launching a new Vlog Monitor accessory so that users won’t have to compromise with the more modest front-facing camera. The 3.5-inch 1280×720 screen can be attached to the phone via a metal holder with a magnetic, detachable design, allowing for better use of that 1-inch 12MP sensor to create higher-quality content than you would be able to with the selfie cam. The design is also modular, so you can attach your preferred tripod, monopod, or gimbal, as well as a 3.5mm 3-pole jack for a dedicated mic. The Sony Xperia PRO-I (again, I for Imaging, not Roman numeral “one”) will go on sale in December for $1,800, a far cry from the first Xperia PRO’s mind-blowing $2,500. The Vlog Monitor will also launch around that time for $200. Sony will also be selling a Style Cover in Leather for the Xperia PRO-I for $90, also starting in December.","","slashgear"

"Now it's Liberals telling us we are going to have to cut the capital gains tax concession if we want to get Australians into homes","https://theconversation.com/now-its-liberals-telling-us-we-are-going-to-have-to-cut-the-capital-gains-tax-concession-if-we-want-to-get-australians-into-homes-170555","","['Peter Martin', ' Visiting Fellow', ' Crawford School of Public Policy', ' Australian National University']","","","NSW is doing what Labor’s Bill Shorten could not – explaining why Australia’s capital gains tax concession is knocking first home buyers out of homes. Shorten went to the 2016 and 2019 elections with a plan – Labor would halve the capital gains tax concession used by landlords who buy and sell properties. In much the same way as he was unable to sell his (now modest by international standards) plan to make half of all new car sales electric by 2030, he was pilloried by Morrision and before him Malcolm Turnbull for a policy they said would smash house prices. Shorten had similar trouble selling his (now modest by international standards) plan to make half of all new car sales electric by 2030 – it was going to “end the weekend”. He was pilloried by Morrison and his predecessor Malcolm Turnbull for negative gearing changes they said would smash house prices. All Shorten was proposing was to wind back the capital gains tax exemption (which exempts from tax half of each profit made from buying and sell real estate and other assets) for future transactions only. The exemption would stay in place for everything already bought. In the face of an overblown debate about whether or not it would smash house prices (Morrison’s department had quietly warned such claims were “not consistent with our advice”) the Labor leader found himself defending modelling about prices rather than outlining what his policy would actually do. And he lost, twice. Now, as we prepare for yet another election, the NSW Coalition government has done what Australia’s Labor opposition could not – make a cogent argument for winding back the capital gains tax concession, saying it “pushes first home buyers out of the market”. Elbowing first home buyers aside In a submission placed quietly on the federal government’s housing inquiry website late last week the NSW government argued that if the concession was cut, housing would be used “more for accommodation needs than investment needs”. Here’s the line of thinking it set out, the line Shorten was never able to get across. The income made from capital gains – from buying something, holding it, then selling it at a profit – is taxed differently from the income made from work or running a business. Only half of it is taxed. Prime Minister John Howard and his treasurer Peter Costello were responsible for the change, introduced in 1999 in the leadup to the introduction of the goods and services tax in 2000, but with less fanfare. Read more: Home prices are climbing alright, but not for the reason you might think Before then capital gains were taxed in the same way as other income (what they are subject to is income tax, there is no such thing as a separate capital gains tax). But before then only the portion of each gain over and above the rate of inflation was taxed, so that people weren’t taxed on a profit that would have no real value. Prime Minister John Howard halved the headline rate of capital gains tax. Brendon Thorne/AAP The change, introduced after an inquiry that found it would “encourage a greater level of investment, particularly in innovative, high-growth companies” was to instead tax only half of each capital gain. It was sold as a small change. A few years earlier, inflation had been big, around 8% per year, meaning that after five or so years only half of each profit would have been taxed in any event. But inflation had since dived to a barely-noticeable 2%, where it has stayed for most of the past 20 years, making a guaranteed exemption from tax of half of each capital gain made trading property away over the odds. It was, as economist Rory Robertson told his clients at the time, “almost as though the Australian tax system has been screaming at taxpayers to gear up to earn increased capital gains rather than to work harder to earn increased wages”. Instead of pouring into high-growth companies, as Howard’s inquiry said it expected, the money flooded into housing, which was easier to borrow for. Rushing into real estate rather than shares As Reserve Bank assistant governor Luci Ellis told a parliamentary inquiry, it was “more profitable to negatively gear property, because you can gear it more”. To buy properties quickly, real estate investors needed to buy properties that would have otherwise been bought to live in. It pushed up prices, but that wasn’t all it did. As the NSW submission to the current housing inquiry says, the most significant impact was “the displacement of owner occupiers (including first home buyers) from home ownership by tax-advantaged investors, predominantly those already on higher incomes”. In its words by encouraging investors to buy and hold property, the 50% capital gains discount increases investor demand for housing and pushes first home buyers out of the market Before capital gains tax was halved and Australians dived into becoming landlords, more than 70% of Australian households owned the home in which they lived and one quarter rented. At the latest count (itself four years old) only two thirds owned the place in which they lived and one third rented. Labor has new friends And properties are less well used. Because income from rent is no longer the chief motivation for holding property (these days most rental properties make a rental loss whereas before the capital gains tax change most made a profit) the NSW government believes more are remaining empty. Now, when the capital gains from holding properties can be measured in hundreds of dollars per day, it would be an ideal time to wind back the capital gains tax discount. Its absence wouldn’t much hurt. Read more: As home prices soar beyond reach, we have a government inquiry almost designed not to tell us why And it’s easy to forget that wasn’t what Labor was proposing. Shorten (twice) put forward something far more modest – leaving the tax discount for existing investments untouched and halving the discount for future investors. It’s no longer Labor policy, but it was backed by the head of the Coalition’s Commission of Audit and the head of its financial system inquiry. And it was of interest to the Business Council of Australia which pointed out that the discount “can distort investor behaviour, particularly at a time of rapid capital gains, such as in a housing or equity boom”. Morrison’s opposition to it was hard to justify at the time. It’s harder now.

"WhatsApp to ask users for ID verification?","https://tech.hindustantimes.com/tech/news/whatsapp-to-ask-users-for-id-verification-71635222313021.html","","","","WhatsApp could ask users to verify their identity in a future update. WhatsApp verification may include submission of documents. This latest WhatsApp report is based on new strings spotted in the latest beta, according to a new report. Here’s everything you need to know.","","2021-10-26 04:28:27","WhatsApp is the world’s most popular messaging service and it is extremely popular in India and Brazil. Apart from chatting, WhatsApp also offers a built-in payments service that is available in both of these countries. WhatsApp Payments service allows users to directly send money to each other. Now, it is being reported that the latest WhatsApp beta version for Android reportedly contains hints that the service might ask users to verify their identity to use payments on the app in the future, according to a new report. According to a report by XDA, WhatsApp for Android version 2.21.22.6 (the latest beta version) has added a few strings that suggest the app might ask users to submit identity verification documents to make payments on the service. However, at this stage, it isn’t clear whether these will be applicable to a specific region as there is no official word from WhatsApp regarding this - it is still under development and could even be removed in a future build. WhatsApp does not ask users for document verification in India or in Brazil at the time of publishing this story - it verifiies Indian users’ phone numbers for the UPI based service. According to the report, WhatsApp uses a different approach in Brazil, asking users to validate their debit or credit cards using Facebook Pay. Meanwhile, on the latest beta, XDA spotted four strings titled “Your identity couldn't be verified. Try uploading the documents again” and another one “Verify your identity to continue using payments on Whatsapp”. There were also two other strings, both titled “WhatsApp Support” that were spotted on the latest beta version of WhatsApp for Android, according to the report. At this point, it is too early to speculate on the reason behind the new strings added to the app, but the report suggests that WhatsApp could be looking to bring the payments service to another region that requires compliance with stricter rules, as Indian and Brazilian users are currently not required to verify their identity, or the verification might be limited for WhatsApp Pay for business purposes. WhatsApp is yet to make any official announcement about this change, and it could be a while before the company does, as it appears to be in development at this time.","https://images.hindustantimes.com/tech/img/2021/10/26/1600x900/illustrations-media-popular-mobile-apps-sites-social_f65e5470-456a-11e9-9b94-c272560e6ac5_1635222356652.jpg","hindustantimes_tech"

CANBERRA, Oct 26 — Australia will target net zero carbon emissions by 2050, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said today, but it will not legislate the goal and instead rely on consumers and companies driving emission reductions.The adoption of the target will ease international criticisim of Australia which had earlier refused to join countries such as Britain and the United States in pledging zero emmissions by 2050 ahead of the United Nations COP26 climate conference in Glasgow from October 31 to November 12.Morrison said Australia, one of the world’s largest emitters of greenhouse gases on a per capita basis and a major exporter of fossil fuels such as coal, will achieve its net zero target largely through technology development, with government investment totalling A$20 billion (RM62.3 billion).This investment, Morrison said, will reduce the costs of technology such as clean hydrogen, which will increase their use.Morrison, who faces an expected close election by May 2022, sought to downplay any threat on domestic industries and jobs as a result of reducing emmissions.“Australians want action on climate change. They’re taking action on climate change, but they also want to protect their jobs and their livelihoods. They also want to keep the costs of living down,” Morrison told reporters in Canberra.“I also want to protect the Australian way of life, especially in rural and regional areas. The Australian way of life is unique.”While Australia will introduce a 2050 target, Morrison said Canberra will not strengthen its 2030 target of reducing emissions by 26-28 per cent from 2005 levels.However, Australia will surpass that target, reducing emissions by 2030 by between 30-35 per cent, he said.Morrison struggled to gain backing for the net zero target from his coalition government’s junior partner, the National Party, which has a regional power base reliant on agriculture and mining, and has long opposed climate policies.However, the party said on Sunday it would support a net zero target. The Australian Financial Review reported the deal included an agreement for increase spending on regional infrastructure and tax benefits for income derived from carbon farming.The deal will aid Morrison’s political position in regional areas that have historically been critical of economic restrictions to curb carbon output.A widely watched poll yesterday showed Morrison is on course to lose to the centre-left Labour party. — Reuters","2021-10-26 04:28:05","","","malaymail"

Chappelle, one of the biggest names in American comedy, told his audience that ""gender is a fact"" in his hour-long Netflix special The Closer. In his first public remarks since the controversy , he posted on Instagram that he was willing to discuss his show with members of the transgender community but added that he is ""not bending to anybody's demands"". ""If they had invited me I would have accepted it, although I am confused about what we are speaking about,"" he continued. ""I said what I said and boy I heard what you said. My god, how could I not? ""You said you want a safe working environment at Netflix. Well, it seems like I'm the only one that can't go to the office anymore."" Last week, the streaming giant's decision to air the show saw Netflix employees walk out in protest . A rally at the company's offices drew around 100 people.

The one-time NSW Blues halfback was also embroiled in a cocaine scandal in 2019 which saw him sentenced to 300 hours community service. But he’s since stayed out of trouble. “Obviously, it’s been a long journey,” Mullen told SEN . “To get that final email from the [NRL] Integrity Unit to say that they’ve cleared me, to wish me all the best, it was very surreal.” Mullen says his focus these days is on youth work and playing well for the Falcons, but he hasn’t given up on a dream NRL recall - even if the game has changed. “I think you do need a calm head out there, the game has gotten so fast,” Mullen added. “People need to think so fast on their feet, the young halves these days, most of them are very sort of structured I think – I’m not being critical of them – but they sort of don’t play what they see and instead go with set plays. “Playing the old-school type of way and obviously the left foot kicking could be a positive to a team. “I’m sitting here trying to sell myself, but I at least think I could be a back-up for a team… I really do believe my body can hold up.” Mullen - who debuted for the Knights in 2005 and made 211 appearances - said he’d had “a few nibbles” of interest from NRL clubs but nothing concrete. “I’m just going to bide my time, I’m sort of in a win-win situation,” he said. “I’m loving my time up here on the Sunshine Coast, and I can play for the Falcons. “If I’m playing good enough here, with a good pre-season, transfer windows and all of that, if I’m playing good enough a team could reach out and take me then. “I’m not putting too much pressure on it.” Originally published as Jarrod Mullen getting a 'few nibbles’, eyes NRL return The Knights have been accused of failing to tell the whole story about the rumours surrounding Mitchell Pearce and Luke Brooks. Peter V’landys has been instrumental in pulling the NRL through two Covid-ravaged seasons, but this comment left fans scratching their heads.

The article, which was timed to the 75th anniversary of Göring’s death and resembled a eulogy, included details about the Nazi leader’s youth, military career and close relationship to Adolf Hitler, accompanied by various photos. In a statement posted to Twitter, the Jewish Community of Chile organization called the article “an apology for Nazism.” “In Europe, this publication would be considered a crime,” the organization said, referring to countries that outlaw Nazi sympathizing. Germany’s embassy in Santiago said “It is not customary for the Embassy to comment” on newspaper articles, but added, “We just want to make it very clear: This character, H. Goering, committed crimes against humanity and was one of the pillars of the Nazi regime.” Göring was one of Hitler’s highest-ranking officers and helped create the Gestapo secret police force. During Hitler’s Four-Year Plan in 1936, he was given broad economic powers, including the authority to confiscate Jewish property. He benefited personally from looted art, and during the Holocaust had possession of Matisse’s “Girl in Yellow and Blue with Guitar.” President of Chile Sebastian Pinera and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (credit: KOBI GIDEON/GPO) At the Nuremberg trials in 1946, Göring was found guilty of conspiracy, crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. He was sentenced to death by hanging but committed suicide hours before it was carried out by ingesting cyanide. El Mercurio, which has a conservative political slant, is known as Chile’s newspaper of record. Multiple politicians running in Chile’s presidential also criticized the article. “There isn’t even a speck of room for criminals against humanity,” wrote Sebastián Sichel, an independent running as part of the conservative Chile Podemos coalition. “My solidarity with the Jewish community and to anyone else who may have felt offended by the publication.” Yasna Provoste, head of the centrist Christian Democratic Party, expressed “deep solidarity with the Jewish Community of Chile.”","","jpost"

"Anglican priest to speak at BYU forum Tuesday as part of his journey with the Latter-day Saints","https://www.deseret.com/faith/2021/10/25/22741067/pembroke-colleges-rev-dr-andrew-teal-to-speak-at-byu-as-visiting-scholar-after-suffering-burns","","['Tad Walch']","","","The Rev. Dr. Andrew Teal makes a point about a passage in the Doctrine and Covenants from his copy of the Latter-day Saint quadruple combination during an interview about the Oxford chaplain’s upcoming BYU forum address at his residence in Provo, Utah, on Monday, Oct. 25, 2021. | Tad Walch/Deseret News The Rev. Dr. Andrew Teal’s friendship with Elder Jeffrey R. Holland led to his time at BYU and his desire to help fight intolerance of Latter-day Saints. Third-degree burns threaten to prematurely end a semester as a visiting scholar at BYU for an Oxford theologian and Anglican priest, but not before he delivers the campus forum address Tuesday at the Provo, Utah, school. The Rev. Dr. Andrew Teal suffered the burns when he walked barefoot onto an Orem patio with heat-reflecting shingles. He was hospitalized for most of a month while doctors conducted multiple skin grafts, first taking skin from a cadaver. “I walked around in someone else’s soles for a while,” the Rev. Teal said with a smile and good-natured laugh during an interview Monday. He is spending the fall at BYU at the invitation of his friend, Elder Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of BYU’s sponsoring institution, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The Rev. Dr. Teal will speak at 11:05 a.m. in the Marriott Center. He said he will talk about how the Church of Jesus Christ and its scriptures have blessed his life and how he has committed himself to standing up for the church. “I’d just like people to come along and to be open minded,” he said, “to listen to this heretic from England offering and asking that we travel together with integrity and with honesty, but most of all with love.” His burns upended his plans as a visiting scholar at BYU’s Neal A. Maxwell Institute for Religious Scholarship. He has been to the institute’s offices just a handful of times. Doctors now have grafted skin from his own thigh onto his feet, but he said he still walks with pain, his feet wrapped in white bandages and snugly tucked into velcro medical sandals. The injuries waylaid his expectation that he would write a couple of chapters for a book about the early Latter-day Saints. He said the work is intended to be an outsider’s look at Joseph Smith as an outcast, and then at the outcast’s outcasts — “in other words,” he said, “the people he drew to him and what happened to them after his martyrdom.” He will return to the book later, he said, but he does not harbor a sense of loss. Instead, the Rev. Dr. Teal said his injuries and time in bed and at the mercy of the care of others transformed the process of his desire to journey alongside the Latter-day Saints. So, he has focused his time in Utah more on an idea for a center for theology, religion and constitution at Oxford University. He hoped such a center would increase the partnership between BYU and Oxford’s Pembroke College, where he is a chaplain and theologian specializing in early Christian church history. He said he hoped the center could be a way to address what he said is ongoing intolerance for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints among otherwise good people in academia and other churches. “The academy can be quite negative about the Latter-day Saint community, and what I am absolutely committed to is standing alongside this community, standing to admit out loud that since meeting this community, Elder Holland, the Oxford Ward, the London Mission and also coming here and connecting with the university, my love of and discipleship of the Lord Jesus has rocketed. “People who know me best know that that’s a serious thing. I’ve been a priest since I was 23; I’m now 57; it’s been a long time, but these last five years, that discipleship has taken on a fruitfulness that’s come through the proximity with the church, without me stopping being an Anglican priest or a chaplain or a theologian, but part and parcel of it. So I need to say that out loud, and I need to say, ‘Therefore I want to stand with this community,’ and actually be a conduit to bring other people from other religious streams, beautiful people from different traditions, so that they, too, can find the power, and the liveliness and kindness and the presence of God in this restored community.” The forum will be broadcast live on BYUtv, BYUtv.org, KBYU-TV 11, Classical 89 FM, BYUradio 107.9 FM, and SiriusXM 143. After the forum, the Rev. Dr. Teal will try to remain in the United States until at least Nov. 11, when he and Elder Holland tentatively are scheduled to speak together for BYU’s International Center for Law and Religion Studies, before returning to England for additional care. “You can make that the headline,” he joked. “‘Let him stay! Don’t extradite Teal!’”","2021-10-26 04:25:24","Third-degree burns threaten to prematurely end a semester as a visiting scholar at BYU for an Oxford theologian and Anglican priest, but not before he delivers the campus forum address Tuesday at the Provo, Utah, school.

"Facebook Knew About Abusive Content Globally: Former Employees","https://gadgets.ndtv.com/social-networking/news/facebook-papers-abusive-content-objectionable-racist-violent-post-fail-to-police-employees-documents-frances-haugen-2587932","","","","Facebook employees have warned for years that as the company raced to become a global service it was failing to police abusive content in countries where such speech was likely to cause the most harm,...","","2021-10-26 04:25:06","Facebook employees have warned for years that as the company raced to become a global service it was failing to police abusive content in countries where such speech was likely to cause the most harm, according to interviews with five former employees and internal company documents viewed by Reuters. For over a decade, Facebook has pushed to become the world's dominant online platform. It currently operates in more than 190 countries and boasts more than 2.8 billion monthly users who post content in more than 160 languages. But its efforts to prevent its products from becoming conduits for hate speech, inflammatory rhetoric and misinformation - some which has been blamed for inciting violence - have not kept pace with its global expansion. Internal company documents viewed by Reuters show Facebook has known that it hasn't hired enough workers who possess both the language skills and knowledge of local events needed to identify objectionable posts from users in a number of developing countries. The documents also showed that the artificial intelligence systems Facebook employs to root out such content frequently aren't up to the task, either; and that the company hasn't made it easy for its global users themselves to flag posts that violate the site's rules. Those shortcomings, employees warned in the documents, could limit the company's ability to make good on its promise to block hate speech and other rule-breaking posts in places from Afghanistan to Yemen. In a review posted to Facebook's internal message board last year regarding ways the company identifies abuses on its site, one employee reported ""significant gaps"" in certain countries at risk of real-world violence, especially Myanmar and Ethiopia. The documents are among a cache of disclosures made to the US Securities and Exchange Commission and Congress by Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen , a former Facebook product manager who left the company in May. Reuters was among a group of news organisations able to view the documents, which include presentations, reports, and posts shared on the company's internal message board. Their existence was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Facebook spokesperson Mavis Jones said in a statement that the company has native speakers worldwide reviewing content in more than 70 languages, as well as experts in humanitarian and human rights issues. She said these teams are working to stop abuse on Facebook's platform in places where there is a heightened risk of conflict and violence. ""We know these challenges are real and we are proud of the work we've done to date,"" Jones said. Still, the cache of internal Facebook documents offers detailed snapshots of how employees in recent years have sounded alarms about problems with the company's tools - both human and technological - aimed at rooting out or blocking speech that violated its own standards. The material expands upon Reuters' previous reporting on Myanmar and other countries, where the world's largest social network has failed repeatedly to protect users from problems on its own platform and has struggled to monitor content across languages. Among the weaknesses cited were a lack of screening algorithms for languages used in some of the countries Facebook has deemed most ""at-risk"" for potential real-world harm and violence stemming from abuses on its site. The company designates countries ""at-risk"" based on variables including unrest, ethnic violence, the number of users and existing laws, two former staffers told Reuters. The system aims to steer resources to places where abuses on its site could have the most severe impact, the people said. Facebook reviews and prioritises these countries every six months in line with United Nations guidelines aimed at helping companies prevent and remedy human rights abuses in their business operations, spokesperson Jones said. In 2018, United Nations experts investigating a brutal campaign of killings and expulsions against Myanmar's Rohingya Muslim minority said Facebook was widely used to spread hate speech toward them. That prompted the company to increase its staffing in vulnerable countries, a former employee told Reuters. Facebook has said it should have done more to prevent the platform being used to incite offline violence in the country. Ashraf Zeitoon, Facebook's former head of policy for the Middle East and North Africa, who left in 2017, said the company's approach to global growth has been ""colonial,"" focused on monetisation without safety measures. More than 90 percent of Facebook's monthly active users are outside the United States or Canada. Language issues Facebook has long touted the importance of its artificial-intelligence (AI) systems, in combination with human review, as a way of tackling objectionable and dangerous content on its platforms. Machine-learning systems can detect such content with varying levels of accuracy. But languages spoken outside the United States, Canada and Europe have been a stumbling block for Facebook's automated content moderation, the documents provided to the government by Haugen show. The company lacks AI systems to detect abusive posts in a number of languages used on its platform. In 2020, for example, the company did not have screening algorithms known as ""classifiers"" to find misinformation in Burmese, the language of Myanmar, or hate speech in the Ethiopian languages of Oromo or Amharic, a document showed. These gaps can allow abusive posts to proliferate in the countries where Facebook itself has determined the risk of real-world harm is high. Reuters this month found posts in Amharic, one of Ethiopia's most common languages, referring to different ethnic groups as the enemy and issuing them death threats. A nearly year-long conflict in the country between the Ethiopian government and rebel forces in the Tigray region has killed thousands of people and displaced more than 2 million. Facebook spokesperson Jones said the company now has proactive detection technology to detect hate speech in Oromo and Amharic and has hired more people with ""language, country and topic expertise,"" including people who have worked in Myanmar and Ethiopia. In an undated document, which a person familiar with the disclosures said was from 2021, Facebook employees also shared examples of ""fear-mongering, anti-Muslim narratives"" spread on the site in India, including calls to oust the large minority Muslim population there. ""Our lack of Hindi and Bengali classifiers means much of this content is never flagged or actioned,"" the document said. Internal posts and comments by employees this year also noted the lack of classifiers in the Urdu and Pashto languages to screen problematic content posted by users in Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan. Jones said Facebook added hate speech classifiers for Hindi in 2018 and Bengali in 2020, and classifiers for violence and incitement in Hindi and Bengali this year. She said Facebook also now has hate speech classifiers in Urdu but not Pashto. Facebook's human review of posts, which is crucial for nuanced problems like hate speech, also has gaps across key languages, the documents show. An undated document laid out how its content moderation operation struggled with Arabic-language dialects of multiple ""at-risk"" countries, leaving it constantly ""playing catch up."" The document acknowledged that, even within its Arabic-speaking reviewers, ""Yemeni, Libyan, Saudi Arabian (really all Gulf nations) are either missing or have very low representation."" Facebook's Jones acknowledged that Arabic language content moderation ""presents an enormous set of challenges."" She said Facebook has made investments in staff over the last two years but recognises ""we still have more work to do."" Three former Facebook employees who worked for the company's Asia Pacific and Middle East and North Africa offices in the past five years told Reuters they believed content moderation in their regions had not been a priority for Facebook management. These people said leadership did not understand the issues and did not devote enough staff and resources. Facebook's Jones said the California company cracks down on abuse by users outside the United States with the same intensity applied domestically. The company said it uses AI proactively to identify hate speech in more than 50 languages. Facebook said it bases its decisions on where to deploy AI on the size of the market and an assessment of the country's risks. It declined to say in how many countries it did not have functioning hate speech classifiers. Facebook also says it has 15,000 content moderators reviewing material from its global users. ""Adding more language expertise has been a key focus for us,"" Jones said. In the past two years, it has hired people who can review content in Amharic, Oromo, Tigrinya, Somali, and Burmese, the company said, and this year added moderators in 12 new languages, including Haitian Creole. Facebook declined to say whether it requires a minimum number of content moderators for any language offered on the platform. Lost in translation Facebook's users are a powerful resource to identify content that violates the company's standards. The company has built a system for them to do so, but has acknowledged that the process can be time consuming and expensive for users in countries without reliable Internet access. The reporting tool also has had bugs, design flaws and accessibility issues for some languages, according to the documents and digital rights activists who spoke with Reuters. Next Billion Network, a group of tech civic society groups working mostly across Asia, the Middle East and Africa, said in recent years it had repeatedly flagged problems with the reporting system to Facebook management. Those included a technical defect that kept Facebook's content review system from being able to see objectionable text accompanying videos and photos in some posts reported by users. That issue prevented serious violations, such as death threats in the text of these posts, from being properly assessed, the group and a former Facebook employee told Reuters. They said the issue was fixed in 2020. Facebook said it continues to work to improve its reporting systems and takes feedback seriously. Language coverage remains a problem. A Facebook presentation from January, included in the documents, concluded ""there is a huge gap in the Hate Speech reporting process in local languages"" for users in Afghanistan. The recent pullout of US troops there after two decades has ignited an internal power struggle in the country. So-called ""community standards"" - the rules that govern what users can post - are also not available in Afghanistan's main languages of Pashto and Dari, the author of the presentation said. A Reuters review this month found that community standards weren't available in about half the more than 110 languages that Facebook supports with features such as menus and prompts. Facebook said it aims to have these rules available in 59 languages by the end of the year, and in another 20 languages by the end of 2022. © Thomson Reuters 2021 .embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }","https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/facebook_reuters_small_1581485164640.JPG","ndtv"

From racer and philanthropist Renee Brinkerhoff who is spearheading the completion of her 7th continent of endurance racing, coupled with a humanitarian effort to combat child trafficking -- to Jason de Carteret, famed world-record holder in polar exploration, serving as her navigator and finally, to the completely re-engineered 1956 Porsche 356A vintage vehicle that has been transformed with solar panels and a crevasse bar to sympathetically traverse Antarctica's challenging terrain and withstand the severe weather conditions. The impending 573 km ice trek, scheduled to begin December 5, 2021. The Porsche 356A gets a combination of skis, tracks and a crevasse bar with a dual-sided solar panel After more than 18-months of re-engineering the road-going vintage Porsche 356 for Valkyrie Racing's coldest and most dangerous endeavor, UK-based Senior Chassis Design Engineer Kieron Bradley has succeeded in creating a one-of a-kind ice machine - it's an engineering marvel. With reinforcements to the chassis ranging from aesthetics to safety and environmental considerations, a combination of skis, tracks and a crevasse bar with a dual-sided solar panel are the outward retrofits first noticed, with a particularly bold and aggressive design for the overall exterior. The tracks are positioned at the rear of the car and the ski and track combination increase the flotation by as much as 300 percent compared to 4x4 cars 0 Comments But according to Bradley, not only do the skis make a good looking technologically advanced statement, but they were specifically designed to be supported by all the other components to make less of an impact on the snow than a footprint.

"A third of US Jews changed behavior due to antisemitism -AJC","https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/antisemitism/survey-on-antisemitism-in-the-us-draws-grim-picture-683095","","","","A report surveyed adult American Jews and the general American public, who were asked about their perceptions and experiences of antisemitism.","","2021-10-26 04:24:23","The American Jewish Committee (AJC) released its 2021 “State of Antisemitism in America” report on Tuesday. The survey, which is the largest and most comprehensive that the has ever conducted, draws a grim picture– showing some 39% of American Jews have changed their behavior out of fear of antisemitism. The change of behavior included 25% who have avoided posting content online that would enable others to identify them as Jewish or reveal their views on Jewish issues; 22% who have avoided wearing or displaying things that might enable others to identify them as Jewish; and 17% who have avoided certain places, events, or situations due to concerns about their safety or comfort as Jews. The report surveyed both American Jews and the general American public who are at minimum 18 years old. Both groups were asked about their perceptions and experiences of antisemitism over the past 12 months, including during the recent conflict between Israel and Hamas in May. Some 1,433 Jews were interviewed, as well as 1,214 adults from the general population. The margin of error for both surveys is +/-3.9 percentage points. Within the 24% of American Jews who said they were targets of antisemitism over the past 12 months, some 17% said they had been the targets of antisemitic remarks in person, 12% said they had been the targets of antisemitism online or on social media, and 3% said they had been the victims of physical attacks. The survey also found that 41% of Americans of all backgrounds have personally witnessed an antisemitic incident in the last 12 months, with 31% having witnessed more than one. According to the survey, many of these incidents go unreported. Of those who had been the targets of antisemitism online or through social media, 95% did not report the incidents to police, although almost a fifth (18%) said these incidents made them feel physically threatened, AJC said in a statement. In addition, almost all (96%) of those who had been a target of an antisemitic remark in person did not report the incidents to the police. The survey also found differences of views between US Jews and the general public. While 82% of American Jews believe antisemitism has increased over the past five years, only 44% of the general public shares that view. Whether in support or increasingly through criticism, Israel is what connects most American Jews to their Judaism. (credit: REUTERS) It also found that about a third of Americans over the age of 18 still are not familiar with the term “antisemitism,” while the other two-thirds have heard of it and know what it means, representing an increase compared to last year. Among Jewish responders, 53% approve of how President Joe Biden is responding to antisemitism in the United States while 28% disapprove, the survey found. Half of the Jewish responders also said that they believe antisemitism on college campuses has increased over the past five years. “This critical report confirms that American Jews are deeply concerned about antisemitism in America – and many are limiting their behavior as a result,” AJC CEO David Harris said in a statement. “That one in four American Jews has been the of antisemitism over the past year alone, and that four out of ten have taken steps to conceal their Jewishness or curtail their activities as a result, should alarm all Americans."" The report further covered questions regarding Israel and the BDS movement. 80% of both Jews and the US general public consider the statement “Israel has no right to exist” antisemitic. This includes 92% of Republicans and 83% of Democrats. Similarly, large majorities of both Jews and non-Jews view the statement “American Jews are loyal to Israel and disloyal to America” as antisemitic, with 85% of Jews and 73% of the general public believing that to be the case. 82% of Jews and 63% of the US general public said the BDS movement is either antisemitic as a whole or has antisemitic supporters, with under 15% saying the movement is not antisemitic. Most interestingly, however, is that most Americans surveyed were not very familiar with BDS at all. As far as antisemitism at American universities, 50% of American Jews believe antisemitism on college campuses has increased over the past five years, while 23% said it has stayed the same and 3% said it has decreased.","","jpost"

"WhatsApp will stop for you! Do you have these phones? Check list and how to fix","https://tech.hindustantimes.com/tech/news/whatsapp-will-stop-for-you-do-you-have-these-phones-check-list-and-how-to-fix-71635221333402.html","","","","WhatsApp support is being stopped for a number of older smartphone models, which have been bought by millions of people. WhatsApp support being revoked is effective from November 1. WhatsApp order will apply to both both Android and iOS smartphones. Here are all the details and how to try and fix the problem.","","2021-10-26 04:15:15","WhatsApp has been steadily getting a slew of updates to make the chatting experience better than ever. Most of these features are reliant on the latest Android and iOS software, and in order to have the same experience for everyone, WhatsApp keep dropping support for older OS as time passes. And as part of this practice, WhatsApp has again dropped support for a few older smartphones. As part of the next move, WhatsApp will now not be supported on Android devices still running on Android 4.0.3. On the iOS side of things, iPhones running on iOS 9 too will not get support. The support will be dropped starting November 1 but users won’t be immediately unable to use the service; it will keep working until the next major WhatsApp update drops. WhatsApp support dropped on these phones Now, Android 4.0.3 was available on a lot of Android devices back in its heydays. Hence, there are a lot of smartphones that will be affected by this move. Some of the popular ones from Samsung include the Galaxy S2, Galaxy S3 Mini, Galaxy Trend 2, Galaxy Trend Lite, Galaxy XCover 2, Galaxy Core, and Galaxy Ace 2. Similarly, a lot of smartphones from the 2011-2013 era will lose support of WhatsApp in the next few weeks. However, the chances of most of you using any of these smartphones is slim, especially in 2021. Hence, you needn’t worry too much about the drop in support. However, if you decided against updating your iPhone 6S since you first started using it in 2015 for some reason, now might be right time to get that iOS 15 update. WhatsApp will drop support for iOS 9 devices but the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus are compatible with the latest iOS 15 update. Notably, what people with older Android phones can do to keep running their WhatsApp account is to also try and update their phones' software. However, chances of a fix are slim.

The post Horizon Forbidden West Introduces New Tools And Abilities To Traverse The Lush New World appeared first on Geek Culture.","Guerrilla Games, the development studio for the upcoming Horizon Forbidden West, has revealed new mechanics and tools in a PlayStation developer’s blogpost for players to use when the game releases on 18 February 2022. The player character, Aloy, will have her toolkit expanded to allow for free climbing, swimming, various traversal methods, and new melee weapon upgrades. It seems like the sequel to the critically acclaimed Horizon Zero Dawn will be improving upon what made the first game great. Aloy will be able to climb up rocky surfaces freely even in the absence of tribal handholds, which not only gives the game world a more naturalistic feel, but also provides a greater sense of verticality in gameplay. There will also be a kind of high vault traversal mechanic that allows Aloy to hoist herself up surfaces and objects of jumpable height. As for new tools, there is a Pullcaster, which allows players to use as a grapple, and even destroy the environment. Players can even grab onto a higher ledge while in mid-air, and launch attacks from long range while airborne. The Pullcaster can also be used to pull hidden chests towards Aloy or open vents for new paths to climb. There will also the a Shieldwing tool, which works like a glider, allowing Aloy to land from a height smoothly and elegantly. Beyond all that, there is also the addition of a workbench, a new skill tree, new melee features for the spear, new machine mounts, and swimming! Horizon Forbidden West seems to be shaping up to be a behemoth of a release.

"Astros vs. Braves odds, predictions, record & more to know for 2021 World Series","https://www.sportingnews.com/us/mlb/news/astros-vs-braves-odds-predictions-record-world-series/1tjropohk4ad31odao6tvhvgrq","","['Ryan Fagan']","","How will the Braves-Astros World Series play out? Let’s take a look.","","2021-10-26 04:12:08","Once upon a time, the Astros and Braves were regular October opponents. From 1997 to 2005, they faced off five times, with Atlanta taking the first three and Houston taking the last two meetings in the National League playoffs. Neither team went on to win the World Series in those years, though. This time, the winner of the Houston-Atlanta matchup is guaranteed a title because, well, it’s the World Series. This one should be a doozy. How will the World Series play out? Let’s take a look. MORE: World Series schedule, start times, TV channel (Odds courtesy of FanDuel Sportsbook) Spread: Astros -1.5 Moneyline: Dodgers -150, Braves +125 The Astros and Braves did not play this season. Atlanta holds a 381-325-1 lead over Houston in regular-season play. The Braves franchise originated in Boston, moved to Milwaukee in 1953 and to Atlanta in 1966. Houston started as a NL expansion franchise in 1962 and moved to the AL beginning with the 2013 season. The Astros and Braves have met five times in the postseason, all while Houston was in the NL. The Braves eliminated the Astros in the 1997 NLDS (3-0), the 1999 NLDS (3-1) and 2001 NLDS (3-0). The Astros beat the Braves in both the 2004 NLDS (3-2) and 2005 NLDS (3-1). The Braves have made 10 previous trips to the World Series, winning in 1892, 1914, 1957 and 1995 (their only one in Atlanta). This will be the Astros’ fourth trip to the World Series; they have one title (2017). Can Eddie Rosario continue his hitting heroics? Rosario, the least-heralded of the four outfielders the Braves traded for this year, was incredible against the Dodgers in the NLCS, batting .560 with three homers, nine RBIs and a 1.647 OPS in the six games to earn series MVP honors. There’s no way he can continue to punish pitchers in the World Series, right? Well, that’s what everyone said about Randy Arozarena last year, when the Rays rookie looked unstoppable through the first couple of rounds of the postseason, and then he batted .364 with three more homers against the Dodgers in the World Series. Rosario is locked in at the plate, with a quick bat and good strike-zone recognition. Batting him in the leadoff spot is huge, because not only is he setting the tone, but batting him right in front of Freddie Freeman means the Astros can’t just pitch around him. So he’ll see plenty of strikes. Can Yordan Alvarez continue his hitting heroics? Alvarez raked in the ALCS, didn’t he? The 2019 AL Rookie of the Year bounced back in 2021 after a lost 2020 season, popping 33 homers in the middle of a strong Houston lineup, so he almost flew under the radar. There was no overlooking Alvarez in the ALCS, though. He drove home a run with a sacrifice fly in the first inning of Game 1 and recorded a single hit in each of the first three games. A nice warmup, they call it in Houston. The Astros won Games 4-5-6 by a combined score of 23-3 and Alvarez was 9-for-13 with five extra-base hits — three doubles, a triple and a home run. He sprayed the baseball all over the ballpark. Figuring him out is objective No. 1 for Atlanta’s pitchers. MORE: Yordan Alvarez’ ALCS MVP performance shouldn’t come as a surprise Will Luke Jackson be effective in high-leverage situations? Atlanta’s primary bullpen pieces looked downright dominant in the NLCS against a very patient but potent Dodgers lineup. That’s good for Braves fans, because the Astros have a lineup full of patient, potent hitters. A.J. Minter, Will Smith and Jesse Chavez combined to throw 12 2/3 scoreless innings against L.A., allowing only four hits to go with 12 strikeouts. And we all saw Tyler Matzek’s mastery in Game 6. Wow. But what about Luke Jackson? He gave up the momentum-shifting three-run homer to Cody Bellinger in Game 4 and looked like a pitching machine lobbing meatballs to the plate when he was out there again in Game 6. He made four appearances in the NLCS; of the 15 batters he faced, 10 reached base and five scored. Yikes. Thing is, though, if the Braves are going to survive a seven-game series against the Astros, they need Jackson to pitch like he did in the regular season, when he fashioned a 1.98 ERA and 9.9 strikeouts per nine pitching important innings late in games. MORE: How Tyler Matzek became the Braves’ top reliever 3.16, 185, 3.5. Those are the ERA, strikeout total and bWAR for Lance McCullers Jr., the Astros’ best starting pitcher. He missed the ALCS with an injury, and he’s out for the World Series, too. That’s a tall task, replacing a staff ace on short notice in October. The Astros did a good job closing out the ALCS — Framber Valdez and Luis Garcia, in particular, were dominant in their second starts — but surviving a second consecutive best-of-seven series without McCullers will be tough. Houston does have some pitching depth, but we’ll see how the Astros fare against a strong Atlanta lineup. Look, these probably aren’t the teams most fans outside Atlanta or Houston wanted to see in the World Series. But if you can get past that disappointment, this should be a highly entertaining series. Both lineups are deep, with power throughout. Both pitching staffs are solid, with strikeout guys in the bullpens. The Braves get the tiniest of nods. Prediction: Atlanta in 7","http://images.daznservices.com/di/library/sporting_news/69/8e/correa-soler-102521-ftr-gettyjpg_7i5v28te2nuo1fwnoku6newux.jpg?t=-1124406132","sportingnews"

Daredevils can scale the 1,296-foot-tall 30 Hudson Yards as part of the new City Climb experience.","Living the high life! Daredevils can scale the 1,296-foot-tall 30 Hudson Yards as part of the new City Climb experience.","2021-10-26 04:11:53","It’s the really high line. Starting Nov. 9, thrill seekers can walk almost to the tippy-top of the 1,296-foot-tall 30 Hudson Yards skyscraper in Midtown, but not from the comforts of an indoor observatory. This trek takes visitors along the outside of the building — with no windows or other protective barriers standing between them and sky-high views of the Big Apple. They will, however, be equipped with safety harnesses. Welcome to City Climb , a high-altitude attraction that takes up to eight daredevils and their skyscraper sherpa to a dizzying 1,271-foot-high perch, called the “Apex,” near the tower’s crown. It begins at the building’s 100-story-high Edge observatory and only gets higher from there, with guests taken along a dizzying series of stairs and platforms that continually rise in altitude. All it takes is $185 for a ticket and a strong stomach. Visitors with lesser constitutions can stick to Edge — a viewing platform 1,131 feet up that’s safely ensconced by glass paneling where general admission starts at $36 for adults. There, you can step out onto a portion of glass flooring for an added thrill. From that platform, trained guides take participants on the vertigo-inducing climb and ascend a series of steps to reach the aptly named “Apex.” Along the way, they visit a perch named “The Cliff,” where they can look down a full 1,190 feet to the street. The most intense portion comes during a 161-step climb up a 45-degree incline to the top. Once they reach the zenith, climbers can get an extra thrill by leaning off the Apex’s open-air viewing platform — with nothing obstructing their panoramic views, which extend out to the Atlantic Ocean. It’s “a chance to live out a superhero fantasy at the top of NYC,” Cassie Davison, vice president of marketing for Hudson Yards Experiences, told The Post. Before setting out, guests must complete a safety briefing. That, combined with the total 370-step ascent and descent, lasts up to two hours. Organizers say City Climb is also the highest external building climb in the world — but much to New York’s chagrin, it isn’t the first. In August 2011, downtown Toronto’s CN Tower opened its EdgeWalk attraction, the first of its kind in North America. Similar to City Climb, EdgeWalk takes adrenaline-junkie visitors on a harnessed walk around the tower’s main pod 1,168 feet above that city’s own bustling streets. Beyond bragging rights, the admission price also includes entry to Edge — where they can settle down with Champagne at its bar — and souvenirs, such as a personalized video of each person’s climb.","https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/the-apex-2.jpg?quality=90&strip=all","nypost"

Google has now updated the widgets with more size configurations and an hourly forecast. The 3×3 widget, which is still named “Weather” and lacks a description, now defaults to 4×2 in the preview page. That size (or 5×2) gets you a four-hour forecast and a condition summary, while “More on weather.com” is unfortunately shown at the very bottom. You can shrink it back down to a square to get just the current temperature and high/low, as well as the current location in the top-right. This particular update makes the widget much more info-dense and practical. Meanwhile, the diagonal pill can now be expanded horizontally to become a landscape pill that includes high/low in addition to the large temp digits and condition icon. The max configuration is quite large. There’s also the option to shrink down into a 3×1 oval where the items appear side-by-side rather than overlapped. It’s now much more practical to use this widget. The Material You weather widgets were first introduced with Google app 12.41 and this update is available with the 12.42 beta . Google released a slew of widgets in the lead up to Android 12’s launch and is now making various functional refinements. That said, brand new ones are still set to arrive for Gmail, YouTube Music, and Google Drive .

Now, Diddy is selling the home Porter lived in.","Diddy is finally ready to unload the home of his beloved ex, Kim Porter. Porter died suddenly in 2018, leaving the music mogul to be the primary parent of their three children. Since Porter’s death, Diddy appears to have adjusted to single fatherhood with pride and openly professes his commitment to ensuring his children are raised the way Porter would have wanted. Now, Diddy is selling Porter’s LA mansion. Kim Porter and Diddy at the Vanity Fair Oscar Party 2005 | Mark Mainz/Getty Images Diddy lists Kim Porter’s home for sale Porter was found dead in her home in November 2018. Months later, an autopsy would reveal that Porter died of pneumonia at the age of 47. Per Atlanta Black Star, Diddy has not visited the home since Porter’s death. However, he recently listed the home for sale. Source: YouTube Related: Sean Combs Reveals Who Inspired Him to Change His Name to ‘Love’ The home was originally built in 2006 and boasts six bedrooms and six and a half bathrooms. Described as “traditional” in style, the Toluca Lake home is nearly 10,000 square feet. The home features a two-story entry foyer, “high ceilinged public rooms as well as intimate private retreats,” patios, a family-sized pool and spa, and a sports court. Diddy listed the home for $7 million. Diddy never personally lived in the home but he purchased it for $5 million in 2009 for Porter and their children. Promotional photos of the empty home include the home’s entryway with checkered patterned marble floors, a chef-style kitchen, one living room area, bedrooms, bathrooms, a theater room, and the large backyard. The hip hop mogul opens up about his regrets Diddy and Porter dated on and off beginning in the early 90s until 2007. Their relationship ended after Porter discovered Diddy fathered a child born just months before their twin daughters. Despite their breakups, the two remained close, even vacationing together. Source: YouTube Related: Al B. Sure Reveals He and Diddy’s Ex, Kim Porter, Were Once Married During an Instagram live with Fat Joe, Diddy described Porter as “the one who got away.” He told the fellow rapper: This is a special announcement for all the players and playboys. When you find that one, don’t be playing around with it because it’s rare for someone who’s going to understand you, be there for you unconditionally. Sometimes, you can be in the game getting hot and you just wanna experience everything. I definitely, as a man, feel like I f—-d up on that. I feel like she was the one for me and I played around thinking that I’m running things – God is running things and he changed me as a man to be able to really appreciate love. Diddy gushes about fatherhood The rapper has always boasted about his children. But he admits that he put work before his family for many years. He says that after Porter’s death, his priorities changed. “Losing Kim and now being a single father of six, my thinking had to change,” he told Naomi Campbell per Us Weekly. “I had to really get focused on their futures because I know how rough it is out there…We’re really focused on our plan after this. Taking time to really ask the girls and ask the kids what they want to do…We’re trying to really just plan and see what we want to take to the next step as a family.” Diddy has tons of help with his children, including his other co-parents, his mother, and a host of family members and friends.  Read the original article from The Cheat Sheet","2021-10-26 04:03:24","","","cheatsheet"

Rob Bishop, R-Utah, talks with the Deseret News and KSL editorial boards in Salt Lake City on Monday, July 29, 2019. | Scott G Winterton, Deseret News Former Republican Congressman Rob Bishop abruptly resigned from Utah’s independent redistricting commission on Monday, just a week away from the group’s deadline to submit its maps to the Utah Legislature. Bishop said since the commission has more members from urban areas along the Wasatch Front, that would lead to the group recommending districts that don’t have a mix of urban and rural areas — a mix that Bishop would like to see. “What I’m telling you is I am frustrated with this process and I’m frustrated with what I am hearing, frustrated with where we are going, because this commission is designed not to work,” Bishop said during the commission’s meeting. “I respect each of you as an individual, but I’m sorry, as a group we suck.” The redistricting commission considered four different maps that would realign Utah’s four congressional districts based on data from the 2020 census. The commission must recommend one of the maps to the Legislature, which has the final say on redistricting, by Nov. 1. Later in the meeting, the remaining six commissioners unanimously approved three congressional district maps, which will be submitted to the Legislature. The commission will send a total of 12 maps to the Legislature, including maps for state legislative districts and school boards. Bishop represented Utah’s 1st Congressional District in the northern part of the state from 2003 to 2021. Bishop said he liked the commission’s proposed ”green” map, which would see the Salt Lake Valley divided up into three of the four districts, along with large rural areas of southwest, central and southeast Utah. The commission’s “orange” and “purple” maps see most of Salt Lake County and Utah County in their own separate districts, along with most of rural northern and southern Utah in separate districts. Bishop noted that many rural counties have much more of their land owned by federal government agencies, such as the Bureau of Land Management, than urban counties. For that reason, Bishop said he believes it’s important to have those urban areas represented in each of Utah’s four districts. “They have, basically, the BLM as an absentee landlord that does impact and control their lives in more ways than we know,” he said. Bishop also accused the redistricting commission of trying to gerrymander congressional elections by creating maps that include districts that are mostly urban, which might be more likely to vote for Democrats. “It’s not the way we do things,” he said. “It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to look at these maps and see what would happen.” Utah House Speaker Brad Wilson, who appointed Bishop to the commission, expressed solidarity with Bishop and said he would not appoint a replacement. “I appreciate Congressman Bishop’s willingness to serve on the Independent Redistricting Commission over these past several months. I share his frustrations with how the commission has conducted its business. His decision to step down at this point in the process is further evidence that the duly elected representatives of the people are best suited to redraw district boundaries, as the courts have repeatedly affirmed,” Wilson said in a statement Monday. Katie Matheson, deputy director for progressive advocacy group Alliance for a Better Utah, criticized Bishop’s comments. “Bishop misunderstood the assignment. He thought the purpose of the UIRC was to send warriors to congress to fight battles over public lands,” Matheson said in a tweet. “Public lands are very important in Utah, but the needs of 80% of the state must not be ignored while public lands battles wage.” Bishop misunderstood the assignment.

The post Amazon Singapore Latest To Launch Official Apple Store Alongside Shopee & Lazada appeared first on Geek Culture.","Hot on the heels of Shopee and Lazada, Amazon.sg has just launched their official Apple Store, offering its customers the majority of Apple’s slate of products. This is a welcome addition, ahead of Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Why would you order from Amazon.sg versus buying directly from Apple.com you say? Well for starters, there are seasonal deals such as Prime Day (in June each year), along with the occasional bank promotions, gift card promotions as well as vouchers. The same can be said for Shopee and Lazada too, so in our geeky expert opinion, it’s always a better choice to order Apple products from any of the three eCommerce sites. The funny thing about Amazon’s Apple Store though, is that while it sells iPads, Apple Watch, AirPods and even the new MacBook Pros, the recent range of iPhone 13 devices are noticeably missing, Meanwhile, both Lazada and Shopee have the full range of Apple products. Even when there are no deals or vouchers, certain products on all three platforms, such as the AirPods Pro, are already priced lower, at S$319, as opposed to S$379 on Apple.com. One thing to note though, is that the S$319 price applies to both Shopee and Lazada too, in case you prefer to shop elsewhere. 3rd gen AirPods. Looking to get the latest 3rd generation AirPods instead? It’s out now for S$269. Or if you’re hunting for the latest Apple Watch Series 7, the full range is available too, starting from S$599.

As Tuesday approaches, customers are finally having their 2021 MacBook Pro orders delivered. The company has scheduled the official launch of the new 2021 MacBook Pro in stores for October 27. Now the first customers to pre-order it last Monday are already getting their hands on their new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro. As expected, users are already sharing real-world images of these new MacBooks on Twitter . The new MacBook Pro models have been completely redesigned and now feature more ports, an edge-to-edge 120Hz Mini-LED display, full-sized keyboard with function keys, MagSafe, and Apple’s powerful M1 Pro and M1 Max chips. Due to limited supplies and high demand, the shipping estimate for the new 14-inch and 16-inch 2021 MacBook Pro has already slipped to late December . If you have not pre-ordered one, you may not be able to get it before Christmas.

Entre sus clientes constan grandes empresas como Banco Santander, Coca Cola, Orange, Samsung , Huawei, Renault, o Mercedes Benz. Actriz, guionista y directora de cine estadounidense Por su lado, la californiana Kansas Bowling ( Hollywood , 2 de agosto de 1996) es una actriz, guionista y directora de cine y fotografía estadounidense. Es conocida por dirigir la película B.C. Butcher (2016)o por su papel en la oscarizada Érase una vez en Hollywood (2019), dirigida por Quentin Tarantino. Su nuevo largometraje es Cuddly Toys (2021). Actualmente es pareja del músico electrónico Don de Vore, componente del dúo Collapsing Scenery. En Érase una vez en Hollywood interpretaba a una de las chicas Manson junto a su hermana, también actriz, Parker Love Bowling. Ha dirigido a Iggy Pop en uno de sus vídeos para el grupo Death Valley Girls. El vídeo en cuestión presenta a Iggy Pop imitando el famoso videoclip de Andy Warhol en el que se come una hamburguesa en una sola escena. La obra en la que colabora el cordobés Moi se trata de la versión en libro de su segundo largometraje , Cuddly Toys, un trabajo que, según su sinopsis, no es una obra feminista al uso, pero que trata de entrar en el debate sobre el asunto . En palabras de Kansas, «mi recomendación para las mujeres que quieren hacer cine es que nunca usen el hecho de serlo como una muleta o una ventaja. No culpes a tu género por una falta de oportunidad… hay que guiar con el ejemplo, es la única manera de hacer un verdadero cambio». La película cuenta con más de 100 actrices en el reparto. Según Moi , la colaboración surgió «en un tiempo donde en las redes prima el postureo artificial. Cuando vi por primera vez su perfil de Instagram quedé impactado porque encontré algo muy distinto a lo habitual. Kansas transmitía un potencial creativo increíble, es, aparte de muy bella, una talentosa chica culta, muy trabajadora, libre y sin complejos». Moi indica que incluso llegó a incluir a Kansas como un guiño humorístico a los aficionados cordobeses al cómic «disfrazada» de Supergirl (Dc cómics) en la portada del calendario que coordina para la Diputación de Córdoba , sentada en Belalcázar junto a un abuelo con la cara de Stan Lee (Patriarca de la Marvel). «Ahora tengo la certeza de que aquellos dibujos le gustaron mucho, ya que ha contado conmigo para ilustrar el libro del making off de su segunda película, Cuddly toys».","https://estaticos-cdn.prensaiberica.es/clip/f30cc04b-6644-4e64-b1ca-63ee9f927fca_16-9-aspect-ratio_default_0.jpg","diariocordoba"

Observations of the chemical compositions of the solar system rocky bodies and of other planetary systems have increasingly shown a concordant picture that the chemical composition of rocky planets reflects that of their host stars for refractory elements, whereas this expression breaks down for volatiles. This behavior is explained by devolatilization during planetary formation and early evolution. Here, we apply a devolatilization model calibrated with the solar system bodies to the chemical composition of our nearest Sun-like stars -- α Centauri A and B -- to estimate the bulk composition of any habitable-zone rocky planet in this binary system (""α-Cen-Earth""). Through further modeling of likely planetary interiors and early atmospheres, we find that compared to Earth, such a planet is expected to have (i) a reduced (primitive) mantle that is similarly dominated by silicates albeit enriched in carbon-bearing species (graphite/diamond); (ii) a slightly larger iron core, with a core mass fraction of 38.4+4.7−5.1 wt% (cf. Earth's 32.5 ± 0.3 wt%); (iii) an equivalent water-storage capacity; and (iv) a CO2-CH4-H2O-dominated early atmosphere that resembles that of Archean Earth. Further taking into account its ∼ 25% lower intrinsic radiogenic heating from long-lived radionuclides, an ancient α-Cen-Earth (∼ 1.5-2.5 Gyr older than Earth) is expected to have less efficient mantle convection and planetary resurfacing, with a potentially prolonged history of stagnant-lid regimes.

Karl-Anthony Towns had 32 points and 14 rebounds, Anthony Edwards scored 28 and Patrick Beverley added 13 for the Wolves. Ingram scored eight points as New Orleans started the third quarter with a 10-0 run that produced a 64-43 lead. Edwards made a 3-pointer for Minnesota’s first points of the quarter and started a 7-0 run. He scored eight straight points as the Wolves got within 68-61. The Pelicans increased the lead to 11, but Minnesota cut it to 80-73 as Edwards finished the quarter with 21 points. Beverley made two 3-pointers to get the Wolves within six before New Orleans scored five straight. Ingram made three consecutive baskets as the Pelicans took command with a 104-88 lead with 2:15 remaining. The lead changed hands eight times and the score was tied three times before the Pelicans scored the final seven points to take a 25-19 lead at the end of the first quarter.

Customer reviews are the lifeblood of shopping on Amazon, but because of their importance they’re also highly susceptible to tampering. So, to get a better sense of how far we can truly trust these ratings of one to five stars, our reporters sometimes go slumming in the one-star bin. This time Masanuki Sunakoma took the plunge and bought an alarm clock from Amazon Japan that had an average rating of 1.1 stars based on 12 reviews as of this writing. Generally, if just one or two people give something a bad review, there’s still a fair chance that it’s just misunderstood, but when 12 people are saying a product sucks it certainly seems like that’s the case. The box had “Cover” printed on it in a subtly sophisticated style. The calm package design gave the feeling of a high-end electronics product, and suddenly made the price of 2,599 yen ($23) seem not so steep. Also, inside the box where two AAA batteries, which was a nice touch in this batteries-not-included world. Masanuki then reached in and pulled out his new alarm clock…which was a big red button. This actually wasn’t a surprise since he could see the product before buying. This item is labeled as a “time signal device” to be used by the elderly and visually impaired. In that way it sounds like a pretty good idea as a clock that literally tells the time, and is even good for those chronic over-sleepers too tired to open their eyes to know the time. However, that’s where the problems begin. According to the reviews, this clock’s Japanese is “clumsy” and “hard to understand” which is really the worst problem you can have for a voice-based clock. But to find out the truth, Masanuki would first have to set this clock. This works by a simple two-button process. A tiny button near the battery compartment switches between hours, minutes, years, months, days, alarm hours, alarm minutes, and a toggle to set the alarm on or off. The main red button is then used to set the number for each category by pressing it that number of times. ▼ We highlighted the setting button with a red square This is all very easy in theory, but in practice it can be quite maddening. Masanuki was just lucky he wasn’t setting it at 11:59 p.m. on 31 December. ▼ The clock setting process That was a bit of a hassle, but considering the clock was intended to be used as an audio interface, there probably weren’t many other options. While watching the above video, those familiar with spoken Japanese might have noticed that the voice had a certain accent to it, possibly Chinese. According to the box the clock was made in China, so that was likely the case. Still, with all the available computerized voices out there, it’s interesting that they sold a clock that spoke Japanese with a fairly heavy Chinese accent. Once it was set up, Masanuki took it for a test drive. He pressed the big red button once like a contestant on a quiz show. “The…time…now…is…one…fif…ty…two…minutes…p.m.” Pressing the button once again soon after will make it say the date. “The…current…date…is…October…twentieth…Wednesday…” ▼ The time-telling process View this post on Instagram A post shared by 砂子間正貫 (@sunakoman) There technically wasn’t anything wrong with what the clock said, but Masanuki could kind of see why some people might have trouble with the stilted delivery and accent. Still, he could see himself getting used to it just fine, and when he closes his eyes he could feel like he was in China. The oddest idiosyncrasy is that the voice designates the minutes as “minutes” but doesn’t say anything for the hours. This can cause some utterances that might cause a double-take, like how “seven fifty-two minutes” could be interpreted as “7:52” or “752 minutes.” It’s a little more confusing in the Japanese numbering system, but still isn’t horribly hard to understand. However, considering the role of this clock, it’d probably be much better without this way of speaking. A more pressing problem for Masanuki was that when you remove the batteries, the memory completely resets and you have to set the time all over again. He wasn’t sure if that was a common problem with most alarm clocks, but it was really compounded with this one, given how tiresome the setting process is. In conclusion, it certainly is a product with some rough patches. Especially given the number of readily available and affordable professional voice actors in Japan, there really isn’t much of an excuse not to invest in a good voice for a clock that does nothing but talk. Still, there’s a bright side to everything and this clock does have the ability to magically whisk you away to a Beijing hotel, and just in time for next year’s Olympics!

The post All CoD Vanguard Operators: Skins, bundles, prices, more appeared first on Dexerto.","No different from Modern Warfare and Black Ops Cold War before it, CoD Vanguard features an ever-growing list of Operators for you to use across both multiplayer and Warzone. Here’s a complete rundown of every confirmed Operator along with all there is to know about them. Operators are the lifeblood of online Call of Duty these days. No matter what mode you’re playing across either regular multiplayer or in Warzone, you’re always loading into a map as a specific character. Everyone starts out with a default set of Operators but more can be unlocked in a number of different ways. From in-game challenges to premium bundles, there’s always a new way to acquire certain characters. To keep track of everything in Activision’s latest titles, here’s a complete overview of every CoD Vanguard Operator and all there is to know about them. Treyarch/ActivisionA number of new characters will join the Call of Duty family in Vanguard. All CoD Vanguard Operators confirmed for launch Sergeant Arthur Kingsley Kicking things off in the Vanguard-era of CoD is Sergeant Arthur Kingsley. As one of the first characters revealed for the 2021 release, Kingsley was the first Vanguard Operator made available. In fact, this Operator even launched ahead of Vanguard’s release date. Players were able to grab the Kingsley Operator across Warzone, Cold War, and CoD Mobile from September onwards. This character will also be instantly accessible on day one with Vanguard. As a protagonist in the campaign, Kingsley helps lead the Special Forces Squad as a British Paratrooper. The Operator is based on Sergeant Sidney Cornell. ActivisionKingsley is among the first Operators confirmed for Vanguard’s launch. Private Lucas Riggs Next is Australian Operator Lucas Riggs. This character first appeared as a playable Operator in the CoD Vanguard Beta. Riggs will likely be available on day one in Vanguard, potentially through in-game challenges or simply just unlocked by default when levelling up in multiplayer. We’ll update you here as soon as we know how to unlock the Riggs Operator. Riggs is one of the first three Operators in Vanguard to receive a unique skin. For those who purchase the Ultimate Edition, the Task Force One Pack comes with a unique Operator Skin to equip for Lucas. ActivisionRiggs is a key character in Vanguard’s narrative. Daniel Take Yatsu Yatsu is another character set to feature prominently in the Vanguard storyline. This Operator made his debut in his very own intro trailer on October 26. Guaranteed to be a day one Operator, Yatsu will be accessible right away in Vanguard’s multiplayer modes. ActivisionYatsu features prominently throughout Vanguard’s campaign. Padmavati Balan Also revealed alongside Yatsu, Padmavati Balan is a natural leader that makes her presence known in the Vanguard campaign. Players will be able to drop into Vanguard’s multiplayer modes with the Balan Operator skin from launch day on November 5. ActivisionPadmavati will be accessible at launch as a multiplayer Operator in Vanguard. Lieutenant Polina Petrova Polina Petrova is another Operator from Vanguard’s campaign that will be accessible on day one. After a brief glimpse at the character in the Beta, players will be able to stick with Petrova moving forward across multiplayer modes. As an expert sniper, Petrova is one of the more formidable foes on any map. Based on Lyudmila Pavlichenko, this figure built a reputation as “Lady Death” for having one of the sharpest shots in WWII. Read More: CoD Vanguard & Warzone anti-cheat revealed Petrova is also one of just three launch day Operators in Vanguard with her own unique skin variant. Accessed through the Ultimate Edition, the Task Force One Pack comes with a special Operator Skin just for Petrova. ActivisionPetrova is undeniably the best sniper out of Vanguard’s launch Operators.

PSG to take Tolisso over Pogba? (Transfer Market Web) Bayern Munich midfielder Corentin Tolisso could tempt Paris Saint-Germain as a lower-cost alternative to Paul Pogba. Both players are working on expiring contracts, but Tolisso would command a far lesser salary than the Manchester United man: Despite having had several coaches over the last few years, the truth is that Tolisso has never had the opportunity to win the undisputed title mainly due to injuries. Despite having a contract in force until June 30, 2023, Bayern Munich would welcome getting rid of a Corentin Tolisso, who since he arrived in the summer of 2017, has played a total of 101 games, in which he has scored 19 goals and 13 assists, passing without pain or glory through the Bavarian team, which could now take advantage of the need of Paris Saint-Germain to try to recover a large part of those 40 million euros paid at the time. Honestly, PSG could do a lot worse than Tolisso. When healthy, Tolisso is typically a strong player. The problem, as always, has been keeping him healthy for an extended period of time.

Many contracts expire this season and next. But now there seem to be the first results. As Bild reports, Borussia Mönchengladbach is about to extend the contract with goalkeeper Yann Sommer. The 32-year-old has supported the Foals since 2014 and inherited from Marc-André ter Stegen, who moved to Barcelona. “Yann did a great job in Marc-André ter Stegen’s footsteps. Even at his age, he is a very strong goalkeeper, leader and vice-captain. Yes, we want to keep it for a very long time,” said Gladbach sporting irectorMax Eberl. Sommer himself has shown consistently good performances for his Borussia for years. After a disappointing last season, the Swiss has been back in top form at least since the European Championship and is still a strong support for the Foals at 32. “I’ve been with a great club for seven years.

The latter, which have just sacked Mark Von Bommel, after his latest demise against SC Freiburg, and in spite of his early season five win in a row string, are in fact deeming Terzic a fit candidate for taking over.

Gnabry has been having a very productive season to date, scoring at a high rate. Lewandowski’s was a screamer which came courtesy of Thomas Müller outmuscling Chris Richards off the ball and setting up the Polish striker. In the second half, goals from substitutes Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting and Kingsley Coman wrapped up the performance.

"Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy beginner’s guide","https://www.polygon.com/guides/22734275/guardians-of-the-galaxy-beginners-tips-tricks","","['Jeff Ramos']","","","Image: Eidos-Montréal/Square Enix via Polygon Tips and tricks for exploration, combat, and more Continue reading…","2021-10-26 04:00:00","In Polygon’s Marvel ’s Guardians of the Galaxy beginner’s guide, we’ll show you how to get the most of your time as Star-Lord and the gang. This game focuses heavily on exploration and communication, so we’ll give you tips and tricks to see and hear it all. This guide also covers essential strategies for combat so you can learn to fight as a team. Finding your way around missions in Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is easy. Every main objective has a handy waypoint, ensuring that you can always find the way forward. But it also has another use. If you go in any other direction, you’ll most likely find some loot, collectibles, or one of the game’s many unlockable skins. You’ll know you’re heading down the right path to find a hidden object when one of your companions scolds you for taking a detour. If a teammate mentions going a specific way down the critical path, keep an eye out for areas outside of that. You’ll almost always get rewarded for venturing off, even if someone like Rocket yells at you for ditching them momentarily. While exploring, you may even find unique items that Star-Lord will bring back to the ship. If you find an item like this, he’ll mention how he’d like to follow up with one of his teammates about that item. These will appear back on the ship, usually in the personal chambers of the associated party member. Interact with those objects when you have a chance to trigger special dialogue and backstory. Star-Lord has a scanner that allows him to ping all sorts of objects. The scanner lets him see his teammates, lore objects, collectibles, enemies, and other things he can interact with. In the game’s opening mission, you’ll need to use the scanner frequently to find things you can destroy to move the story forward, but it’s also helpful for revealing destructible objects to create hidden paths. Every time you enter a new area, turn on your scanner and look for loot. This tactic becomes especially helpful once you get Star-Lord’s Components Localizer perk , which places an icon on the screen when components are near. Enable the scanner, and you can more easily identify loot locations. Hidden upgrade components and objects that reveal more story elements are scattered across each locale you visit. Just about every area outside of the main path is hiding something, so don’t worry about wandering around much. You’ll most likely be rewarded for doing so. Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy perks guide There are dozens of moments in Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy when Star-Lord has an opportunity to cut in and say something. These interjections not only move the game’s witty banter forward, but many of the things you choose to say have lasting effects. Siding with certain characters and making big decisions for the group can change how characters feel about you. Certain decisions even affect how entire missions play out. There is so much talking in Guardians of the Galaxy . What you say as the team’s leader often has an impact on how your story plays out. Communicating is just as important as all the fighting that takes place in Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy. Sometimes during missions, your characters stop for a moment before you’re prompted to move on. Take a moment and talk with everyone who has a speech bubble above their head. If you do, you’ll be treated to dialogue that not only reveals more about your crew, but you may even affect the story. The same goes for the interludes on your ship between missions. Before you set off across the galaxy to make some daring mistakes, explore your ship and talk to all your teammates. Talk to everyone before moving on to your main objective. Certain conversations can only happen on the ship. Don’t miss these opportunities to get more stories out of your band of misfits. In combat, you take full control of Star-Lord. While his blasters and melee attacks can take care of most enemies, he’ll need to call upon his allies to perform special attacks. Each of your teammates has unique abilities and combat functions in battle. Alone, these skills are powerful. In tandem, you can clear waves of enemies and tough bosses easily. Rocket excels at a large, area of effect damage. His special weapons and gadgets can hit multiple enemies at once. The engineer’s abilities are best used when you want to dispatch a large group of weaker enemies. Groot uses his body to immobilize enemies. Use him to halt the attacks of multiple or single enemies who won’t get off your back. While Groot stops enemies in their tracks, you and your companions can attack them unimpeded. Drax uses his powerful body to stun large attackers. Some enemies must be staggered before you can chip away at their health. While you and your teammates have some attacks that can cause stun damage, Drax specializes in disabling huge enemies so they can be left vulnerable for the rest of the team to attack. Gamora ’s fast and powerful fighting style lets her deal massive damage to targets. With assassin-like precision, direct her to lay waste to enemies. If you need an enemy taken out quickly, let Gamora handle it. Each of your fellow Guardians will fight enemies alongside you. However, when you put their abilities to use, you’ll take down foes quicker. The team really shines when you combo their abilities together. For instance, you can take out a wave of enemies quickly by having Groot immobilize them. Then, you can have Rocket Raccoon follow up with one of his powerful weapons to take out the entangled enemies. When you encounter large enemies that Star-Lord can’t handle, you can have Drax stagger them. Once they’re no longer a threat, call on Gamora to swiftly finish the job.","","polygon"

Williams also rendered a version in his take on Daisy Yellow as a nod to the original version.

Market Research Future’s Review on Induction Motors Market Multiple Factors to Bolster Market Growth Induction motors are also called Asynchronous motors. Along with the considerable benefits of these motors, such as reliability and load reduction, it also assures that the cost associated with after-sales maintenance is reduced several folds. They are used in a variety of end-use sectors and have so grown rapidly. Furthermore, its lightweight has made it highly popular and given it an advantage over other motors. The population's awareness of environmentally friendly products is growing by the day, and as a result, the Induction Motors Market Size is expanding rapidly. Without a doubt, the resources associated with it are expensive, making it difficult for investors to establish such operations. Nonetheless, with the government's assistance and the benefits of these motors in mind, the induction motors market trends will bloom like a ray of sunlight in the next years. Browse In-depth Market Research Report (188 pages) on Induction Motors https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/reports/induction-motors-market-1603 The Global Market to Recover Post COVID-19 Pandemic The COVID-19 outbreak has had a negative impact on the world economy because numerous industries have been affected by the current situation, and operations in various sectors have come to a halt. One of the most severely impacted industries in the power sector. According to Independent Commodity Intelligence Services, electricity availability in the EU is likely to remain consistent because several countries, including the United Kingdom and Germany, have put in place safety measures to ensure the continuation of operations. This would be beneficial for induction motors in the EU to generate and distribute power in facilities such as isolated residences, farmyards, or pumping stations. However, regional governments' lockdown orders have had an influence on the financial condition of power distribution firms. Since the beginning of the statewide lockdown, India's daily power demand has decreased by 25 to 28 percent, owing mostly to the shutdown of companies and offices in the commercial and industrial sectors. Since the T&D losses suffered are greater than what was previously expected, distribution businesses would have to incur higher aggregate technical and commercial (AT&C) losses than the thresholds specified by the regulators. Nevertheless, the pandemic's influence may have an impact on the forecast for electricity generation in the United States. For example, due to firm closures, retail sales of power to the commercial sector were expected to reduce by 4.7% in 2020. As factories cut back on production, industrial sales are likely to dip by 4.2%. This will eventually have an impact on the country's electrical power generation and magnetic field distribution via induction motors. Furthermore, in China, the industrial sector, which accounts for around two-thirds of China's electricity use, led to the drop in demand, accounting for a 12% decrease in electricity usage.

Consequently, ET is likely to attempt a different strategy in order to best establish communications. It will send physical AI robotic probes that would be linked together by a vast interstellar network of communications nodes.

He makes stream-of-consciousness paintings even though he's not trained in the craft. Simmons said he finds joy in making art like nobody is watching. He once made $150,00 for one of his works of art.","In addition to being a classic rock icon and consummate showman, Kiss’ Gene Simmons is also a painter. He’s recently shared his art with the world. His portfolio includes drawings of iconic landmarks, abstract paintings, wide-eyed tigers, and more. During an interview with Showbiz Cheat Sheet, Simmons discussed his work as an artist. Gene Simmons of Kiss | Jim Dyson/Getty Images Kiss’ Gene Simmons revealed why he started making more art Simmons revealed what drives him to paint. “I’ll tell you the God’s honest truth, I don’t have a f****** clue what I’m doing. I’m untrained. I don’t have a resume. I’ve never done anything except doodles that I’ve done all my life. So, I’ve always doodled.” Simmons noted that some of the “doodles” he was selling contained his drawings on both sides. Simmons explained the origin of some of his works of art. “During the pandemic, I found myself with a lot of free time and instead of going nuts, I started making art. All the paintbrushes and the paint, I don’t know how they work.” He added he didn’t know what the rules of art were. Simmons noted that he used some unorthodox tools to create his work. Simmons said one of his paintings was made partially using paintbrushes and partially using a Sharpie, specifically the type of Sharpie used on champagne glasses.” During weddings, they have different colored Sharpies that have paint inside the Sharpie,” Simmons explained. “So you can write on any surface, including glass. It’s a different quality.” Kiss’ Gene Simmons with his paintings | Ethan Miller/Getty Images RELATED: Kiss’ Gene Simmons Reveals Why Andy Warhol Never Painted Him and the Inspiration Behind His Powerful Self-Portrait [Exclusive] The Kiss frontman discusses the joy of following his intuition He noted that one of his paintings was 4 feet long and four feet wide. He said creating something like that was an example of him throwing caution to the wind. “I did stream-of-consciousness,” he said. “Didn’t think about it. Some are Jackson Pollack-inspired, some are colorful pieces.” Simmons compared his approach to a child at play. “I had a gut feeling about wanting to go and paint. I never held a paintbrush in my hand, I never ordered colors or anything. It’s like when a kid first jumps into a mud puddle. When a kid first jumps into a mud puddle, he jumps up and down and loves it. There’s that joy. So that’s what I have. I have the joy of nobody looking, because when you get judged, sometimes you back off and get self-conscious.” Simmons said artists should follow their own intuition.” Kiss’ Gene Simmons with his paintings | Ethan Miller/Getty Images RELATED: Kiss: Why Gene Simmons Wanted to Change the Lyrics to ‘Beth’ Gene Simmons made $150,000 on 1 painting Following his intuition seems to have worked out for Simmons. He made over $150,000 on one painting. Despite this, he still had a casual attitude toward his visual art. He anticipated his portrait of his mother selling for $250,000. In addition to music, live performances, film, television, his autobiography, and entering the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Simmons can now add painting and drawing to his artistic legacy.

"Planning To Buy A Used Honda Navi? Here Are The Pros And Cons","https://www.carandbike.com/news/planning-to-buy-a-used-honda-navi-here-are-the-pros-and-cons-2587665?publisher=newsstand&amp;utm_source=googlenews","","","","Want to buy a used Honda Navi? Make sure to read our list of pros and cons before you make a decision.","","2021-10-26 03:50:04","Back in 2016, Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India (HMSI) decided to experiment internally on what more it could do with the then Activa platform. The result was a ""desi"" take on the Honda Grom in the form of the Honda Navi . The moto-scooter received polarising opinions at the time of launch and while the transition to BS6 meant, it was pulled out of the Indian market, the model remains a popular seller in Latin America. It's still made and exported from India. The Honda Navi is just the right addition to anyone's garage looking for a peppy urban runabout. If you're in the market looking for one, here are some pros and cons to help your purchase decision. Also Read: Honda Navi First Ride Review The Honda Navi has a compact footprint and quirky looks, while the simple construction makes it convenient to ride Pros The Honda Navi uses a scooter platform to look like a motorcycle. It's compact in footprint and does not take too much parking space. The motorcycle-inspired design, large 12-inch wheels make it better at handling than an Activa. The Honda Navi uses the same 110 cc single-cylinder, air-cooled motor as the Activa but is 7 kg lighter. That makes for a better power-to-weight ratio and a noticeable improvement in acceleration. Spare parts will be easily available too and servicing one is pretty is convenient, given Honda's wide service network. A used example of the Honda Navi will be as low as ₹ 25,000. The models usually do not have too much mileage on them, which make them great for a pre-owned purchase. The compact size means it offers little space for the two adults while it isn't as practical as a scooter Cons As much as everyone likes its quirkiness, there's no denying that the Honda Navi can't match the sheer practicality of a Honda Activa or any other comparable scooter. The instrument console misses out on a fuel gauge. The build quality was too basic and that leaves you wanting more. While it looks like a motorcycle, it's still a scooter underneath and also has fuel efficiency like one. For those looking at high-efficiency figures, you'll be better off buying a commuter motorcycle. The compact footprint means the Navi has a small seat and is not the most comfortable for two adults. Both seat space and legroom become a problem. The suspension set-up isn't the best and tackling bad roads will leave you with a sore back. 0 Comments For the latest auto news and reviews , follow carandbike.com on Twitter , Facebook , and subscribe to our YouTube channel.","https://i.ndtvimg.com/i/2016-04/honda-navi-first-ride-review_827x510_71460464506.jpg","carandbike"

"Planning To Buy A Used Royal Enfield Thunderbird 500? Here Are The Pros And Cons","https://www.carandbike.com/news/planning-to-buy-a-used-royal-enfield-thunderbird-500-here-are-the-pros-and-cons-2587651?publisher=newsstand&amp;utm_source=googlenews","","","","Want to buy a used Royal Enfield Thunderbird 500? Make sure to read our list of pros and cons before you make a decision.","","2021-10-26 03:49:50","Long before the Royal Enfield 650 Twins arrived, it was the 500 cc bikes that were the company's flagships. And the Royal Enfield Thunderbird 500 remained a popular choice for those looking at a middleweight motorcycle with some serious cruising credentials. The 500 cc motor was known for its thump and strong mid-range while the cruiser riding position meant it was quite comfortable compared to a similar capacity street-naked. Sadly, the Thunderbird 500 isn't on sale anymore but you can get one in the used bike market. If you really are craving for one in your garage, here are the pros and cons about the RE Thunderbird 500 that you should know about. Also Read: Royal Enfield Thunderbird 500X ABS Launched In India You can look for a more modern Royal Enfield Thunderbird 500X in the market, while the more recent examples also came with ABS Pros The Royal Enfield Thunderbird 500 benefits from a larger displacement motor and electronic fuel injection in the more recent years. Compared to the Thunderbird 350, the Thunderbird 500 manages to hit speeds up to 110 kmph with ease and the strong mid-range makes it a great mile muncher. The ride comfort remains one of the strongest suits of the TB 500. Moreover, even a decade-old example comes with an LED taillight and a projector lens headlamp that offers good illumination. You can find more recent examples that are the Thunderbird 500X, which not only bring new and vibrant colours but also a slightly more modern look to the motorcycle. Of course, this is more of a subjective choice and will depend on whether you are looking for the traditional look or the X factor. The Thunderbird 500 fairly holds its value and a pre-owned example about 7-8 years old will be priced between ₹ 1-1.3 lakh. Do make sure to negotiate depending on the condition of the bike. That'll make it more affordable than the entry-level Bullet 350. The more recent examples were equipped with ABS and that's that version we'd recommend you get. The Royal Enfield Thunderbird 500 offers spectacular comfort, while its strong highway mannerisms make it a mile muncher. Cons The larger displacement engine also made it less fuel-efficient over the 350 cc version. But it did have a 20-litre fuel tank for fewer stops between refills. The RE Thunderbird 500 was also notorious for small niggles with the sensors going wrong at the least expected moment. Parts on the Thunderbird 500 can get expensive, so make sure you do a thorough inspection before picking one up. For instance, the instrument cluster was prone to breaking and a new one would set you back by around ₹ 7,000. The Thunderbird 500 is heavy with a kerb weight of 199 kg. So be sure if that's what you can manage. The deadweight would seem twice as much during a fall or breakdown. Older examples of the TB 500 can also turn out to be money pits in terms of maintenance. Rusting, engine misfiring, tappet noise, and vibrations will be common if the previous owner did not maintain one well. Make sure you have a reliable mechanic on speed dial before you begin looking for a motorcycle. 0 Comments For the latest auto news and reviews , follow carandbike.com on Twitter , Facebook , and subscribe to our YouTube channel.","https://i.ndtvimg.com/i/2016-01/re-thunderbird-500-asphalt_827x510_51452522790.jpg","carandbike"

"Morrison looks to '04 for election success","https://www.newcastleherald.com.au/story/7485231/morrison-looks-to-04-for-election-success/?src=rss","","['Andrew Brown']","","","","2021-10-26 03:49:33","The prime minister intends to look to the political past to secure his political future. Speaking at a joint partyroom meeting on Tuesday, Scott Morrison indicated a slogan central to John Howard's re-election almost 20 years ago will be a central theme of the coalition's upcoming election campaign. ""The question ... at the next election is 'who do you trust?' Who do you trust to look after your job and your income?"" Mr Morrison said. ""Who do you trust?"" was a key Liberal slogan during Mr Howard's 2004 election campaign against Labor's Mark Latham. During the meeting, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg also drew on how the 2004 election campaign could be used for the coalition's success to secure a fourth term. ""In 2004, the coalition won a fourth term based on 'who do you trust' and let's make sure that happens again,"" Mr Frydenberg said. The treasurer also said the coalition was now in a similar position to 2004 - behind in two-party preferred polls but ahead as preferred prime minister. The coalition won five seats at the 2004 election with a 1.8 per cent swing. The most recent Newspoll showed the opposition ahead 54 to 46 two-party preferred while Mr Morrison is ahead as preferred prime minister 48 to 34. Mr Morrison previously used the ""who do you trust"" line when he called the 2019 election. The election is due to be held by May 21 next year. Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese told a party room meeting December 11 remained a live option for a federal election and Labor was ready to go when a poll was called. While a date for the next election is yet to be set, Mr Morrison told reporters he intended to hand down a federal budget next year. The coalition meeting was told electoral law changes were also slated to be introduced next year. Members also raised concern some large regional electorates did not have as many pre-poll locations as city electorates.

"Planning To Buy A Used Maruti Suzuki Swift? Here Are Some Pros And Cons","https://www.carandbike.com/news/planning-to-buy-a-used-maruti-suzuki-swift-here-are-some-pros-and-cons-2587588?publisher=newsstand&amp;utm_source=googlenews","","","","The Maruti Suzuki Swift is compact, gets decent creature comforts, a peppy petrol engine, and being a Maruti retains good value. So, if you are planning to buy a pre-owned Swift, here are some pros and cons that you should know about.","","2021-10-26 03:49:15","The Maruti Suzuki Swift is one of the most popular cars sold in India. So much so that in Financial Year 2021, it was the largest selling car in the country, accounting for over 1.72 lakh units. However, the Swift's popularity is not just limited to the new car segment, as the trend remains the same in the used car market as well. If you are planning to buy the Maruti Suzuki Swift from the pre-owned car market, here are some pros and cons that you should know about. Also Read: Maruti Suzuki Swift Was The Best-Selling Car In FY2020-21 Pros 1. In the last 15 years, Maruti Suzuki has launched three generations of the Swift hatchback in India, and you can find all three of them in the used car market. 2. Maruti Suzuki discontinued the diesel version of the Swift in 2020. So, if you are looking for a diesel Swift, the used car market is the place to look for one. 3. The Maruti Suzuki Swift came with a peppy 1.2-litre petrol, and a torquey 1.3-litre diesel motor and both are well-built engines. So, even a 5- to 6-year-old model is likely to be in a good condition. Also Read: Maruti Suzuki Swift Reaches 2.5 Million Units Sales Milestone Maruti Suzuki Swift 4. Maruti Suzuki cars retain their value, and even if you decide to sell yours after 3-4 years, you are bound to get good returns. Cons 1. Because Maruti Suzuki cars retain more value, a newer Swift that's 2 or 3 years old will be slightly more expensive compared to a rival brand's model. The new-gen Swift can cost you ₹ 5 lakh to ₹ 7 lakh. 2. In terms of driving dynamics, the Swift might not be the best one out there. The steering is a bit too light and lacks feedback. The suspension is also a bit on the softer side. 3. The Swift has never received a satisfactory safety rating from the Global NCAP. While the new-gen model holds a 2-Star rating, the previous-gen models have also received a zero-star rating. 0 Comments 4. Only the new third-gen Swift gets an AMT option. So, if you are looking for an automatic you'll have to go for the newer more expensive option.

"Covid cases falling, but trouble signs arise as winter looms in US","https://www.indiatoday.in/coronavirus-outbreak/story/covid-cases-falling-but-trouble-signs-arise-in-us-1869379-2021-10-26?utm_source=rss","","","","Covid cases falling, but trouble signs arise as winter looms in US","","2021-10-26 03:41:48","Tumbling Covid-19 case counts have some schools around the US considering relaxing their mask rules, but deaths nationally have been ticking up over the past few weeks, some rural hospitals are showing signs of strain, and cold weather is setting in. The number of new cases nationally has been plummeting since the delta surge peaked in mid-September. The US is averaging about 73,000 new cases per day, dramatically lower than the 173,000 recorded on September 13. And the number of Americans in the hospital with Covid-19 has plummeted by about half to around 47,000 since early September. In Florida, Miami-Dade County's mask mandate could be loosened by the end of October if the encouraging numbers continue, and nearby Broward County will discuss relaxing its requirement on Tuesday. The superintendent in metro Atlanta said he will consider waiving mask requirements at individual schools. A high school outside Boston became the first in Massachusetts to make masks optional after it hit a state vaccination threshold. With about 95% of eligible people at Hopkinton High inoculated, school leaders voted to allow vaccinated students and staff to go maskless for a three-week trial period starting November 1. Still, there are some troubling indicators, including the onset of cold weather, which sends people indoors, where the virus can more easily spread. With required mask use reduced in much of the US, the University of Washington's influential Covid-19 forecasting model is predicting increasing infections and hospitalizations in November. Also, Covid-19 deaths per day have begun to creep back up again after a decline that started in late September. Deaths are running at about 1,700 per day, up from close to 1,500 two weeks ago. The virus is still striking unvaccinated communities, many of them rural areas in states including North Dakota, Wyoming, Alaska and Minnesota. More than 67% of the nation's eligible population is fully vaccinated, and the Biden administration is getting closer to enacting a workplace vaccine mandate for every business in the country with more than 100 employees. In Alaska, which has ranked at or near the top in per-capita case rates over the last month, hospitals remain strained, but health care workers are not speaking out the way they had, said Jared Kosin, president and CEO of the Alaska State Hospital and Nursing Home Association. A recent debate over masks in Alaska's largest city, Anchorage, grew heated, and hospital and public health officials last month reported hostilities toward health care workers related to Covid-19. It's not yet clear, he said, if the state has peaked in terms of cases in this latest surge. ""It's not letting up and I think that's the hardest part with this. It's not like you can see hope on the horizon, you know we're going to see a rapid decline and get through it. it just seems to come and go and when it comes it hits really hard."" In sparsely populated Wyoming, which has one of the nation's lowest vaccination rates, hospitals are coping with more patients than at any other point in the pandemic. The vast majority of hospitalized patients in Wyoming haven't gotten the vaccine, the state's vaccination rate is only about 43%. Only West Virginia ranks lower. ""It's like a war zone,"" public health officer Dr. Mark Dowell told a county health board about the situation at Wyoming Medical Center, the Casper Star Tribune reported. ""The ICU is overrun."" In smaller hospitals in North Dakota, many people are getting long-delayed treatments for other ailments, but combined with Covid patients, facilities are pushed to the limit, said Dan Olson, executive director of a network that includes many of those facilities. ""You can talk in the morning and they have beds and by afternoon they might be at capacity,"" Olson said. In rural Minnesota, a man waited two days for an intensive care bed and later died. Bob Cameron, 87, had gone to his hometown hospital in Hallock with severe gastrointestinal bleeding and Covid-19. Officials searched for space in a larger centre. The bleeding exhausted the hospital's blood supply, and state troopers drove 130 miles (209 kilometres) with new units, but his condition worsened after surgery and he died October 13, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported. ""We can't say for certain, of course, that if he got to an ICU bed sooner than he would have survived, but we just feel in our hearts that he would have,"" said Cameron's granddaughter, Janna Curry. During a three-week stretch this month, rural hospitals in Minnesota were caring for more Covid-19 patients than those in the state's major urban centre, Minneapolis-St. Paul.","","indiatoday"

They try to outdo each other in the number of games they can stream and the number of devices they can stream to. NVIDIA’s GeForce NOW had the advantage of being in beta even before the likes of Google Stadia got started and has been able to expand to more devices than any of its rivals have so far. Its latest trick is to support Microsoft Edge, which, coincidentally, opens the doors to its unofficial arrival on the Xbox. Being able to play games anywhere has always been a dream for gamers, but almost all solutions available today come with their own compromises. Direct mobile gaming naturally excludes many PC and console titles, while game streaming services tend to favor one gaming platform over another. While GeForce NOW is squarely tied to PC games, its availability on almost any computing device makes up for that. NVIDIA’s cloud-based gaming service has been available on browsers, including Apple’s Safari, and it has recently added Microsoft Edge to that list. More than just catering to Windows users who do prefer that browser, it also means that GeForce NOW also indirectly adds Xbox consoles to its supported list of devices. The Verge’s Tom Warren shows how it was relatively trivial to get GeForce NOW running on Microsoft’s console, which practically means getting access to Steam PC games on an Xbox. If that idea didn’t already blow your mind, the tech journalist notes that you can even use a keyboard and a mouse to play those games because Edge on the Xbox supports those input methods too. You can now play Steam PC games on an Xbox with Nvidia’s GeForce Now. Here's a quick look at how it all works. Details here: https://t.co/EMGX0HRxcT pic.twitter.com/G6YcloBubM — Tom Warren (@tomwarren) October 25, 2021 Of course, there are ways to run PC games from the Xbox, but those often require you to have a PC on the same network to stream from. This expansion to GeForce NOW removes the need for console gamers to worry about PC specs just to accomplish that, though they will have to keep in mind their Internet speed in exchange. The feature is still in beta, though, and requires the latest version of Microsoft Edge for Xbox.","","slashgear"

KHARTOUM (Sudan), Oct 26 ­— By ousting senior civilian figures and disrupting a transition to democracy, Sudan’s generals have ensured they maintain control in the East African country, as they have for most of its post-independence history, analysts say.Yesterday security forces detained civilian leaders, including Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, who have shared power with the military following the ouster of the autocratic president Field Marshal Omar al-Bashir more than two years ago.General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan declared a state of emergency and dissolved the cabinet, as well as the ruling Sovereign Council of military and civilian figures which he has led since August 2019.The Council was supposed to pave the way for full civilian rule.Since its independence from Britain and Egypt in 1956, Sudan has experienced rare democratic interludes, but overwhelmingly years of rule under military leaders.The latest putsch “looks very much like an attempt by the security forces to maintain control over economic and political interests, and to resist the flip” to a civilian order, said Jonas Horner of the International Crisis Group.The army’s move “epitomises their fears” of civilian rule “in a country which was under the control of the military for 52 out of its 65 years of independence,” Horner said.To Magdi el-Gizouli of the Rift Valley Institute “the coup was far from surprising”.The Sovereign Council ruled the country alongside a transitional government led by Hamdok, an economist, but the role of civilian leaders had been receding.The main civilian bloc, the Forces for Freedom and Change (FFC) which led anti-Bashir protests, splintered into two opposing factions, one of which held demonstrations in support of the military.An ‘engineered’ crisis Critics alleged those protests were being driven by members of the military and security forces, and involved counter-revolutionary sympathisers with the former regime.“The crisis at hand is engineered — and is in the shape of a creeping coup,” mainstream FFC leader Yasser Arman said two days before the military made its move.Last month the government said it had thwarted a coup attempt, and Burhan dismissed as “slander” suggestions that the army was involved in that manoeuvre.Ahmed Soliman, an analyst from Britain’s Chatham House think-tank, told AFP the military has resisted significant reforms including “professionalisation and civilian oversight” of its institutions, as well as its business interests.The military dominates lucrative companies specialising in everything from agriculture to infrastructure projects.Hamdok said last year that 80 per cent of the country’s public resources were “outside the finance ministry’s control”, although he did not specify the proportion controlled by the army.Such “really critical issues in the transition have fuelled very recent turmoil that is taking place in Sudan and perhaps set the stage for this hostile takeover by the military,” Soliman said.The military’s actions are likely to lead to more instability, he added, so “apart from securing their own interests” it is difficult to know what the officers are trying to achieve, Soliman added.Protests against the coup have already led to three deaths yesterday, and there will be “heavy civilian resistance”, Gizouli said.“The military will have little option but to crush it by force,” he said.Gizouli believes Burhan will remain in power for the foreseeable future but might talk with civilian leaders who remain free, like Foreign Minister Mariam al-Mahdi.“He still needs a civilian face for the government,” Gizouli said. — AFP","2021-10-26 03:33:56","","","malaymail"

Producers will also be making a donation to the AFI Halyna Hutchins Scholarship Fund and will be matching any donations by the crew. ""Although our hearts are broken, and it is hard to see beyond the horizon, this is, at the moment, a pause rather than an end. The spirit that brought us all to this special place remains,"" the statement from the production team said. The Santa Fe Sheriff's Office has set a news conference regarding the investigation on Wednesday. A petition has been created asking Alec Baldwin to ""use his power and influence in the Hollywood film industry to make change and ban real guns on film sets"". Over 22,000 people to date have signed the petition, including actors Olivia Wilde and Holland Taylor.

What you may not know is that DaisyDisk also supports cloud services, so users can use the tool to free up space in Google Drive, Dropbox, and even OneDrive. When it comes to cloud services, they are usually paid and have limited storage, which means that every megabyte there is extremely valuable and should not be spent on old and useless files. As you might expect, DaisyDisk can help you with just that. DaisyDisk searches for file clusters and sorts them by size, making it easy to get rid of files that are taking up space and you no longer need. Just as when analyzing files from Mac storage, you will get the same intuitive interface when using integration with cloud services. The app currently works with Google Drive, Dropbox, and OneDrive, while support for more cloud services will be added in the future. If you use a cloud storage service, DaisyDisk is capable of scanning the contents of your storage directly in the cloud, in the same way as you scan a local disk. In this way you can get a visual breakdown of your cloud storage usage, remove large unneeded files and keep your cloud quota in healthy limits. Once you download the app, all you need to do is click the arrow right next to the “Scan Folder” button to log into your cloud accounts. Then click the “Scan” button and the app will do the rest. DaisyDisk is available on the Mac App Store for $9.99. However, for a limited time, you can purchase it directly from the DaisyDisk website for $7.99 .

"Facebook invests billions in metaverse efforts as ad business slows","https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/facebook-invests-billions-in-metaverse-efforts-as-ad-business-slows-7590889/","['Social', 'Technology']","","","","","2021-10-26 03:32:54","Facebook Inc said on Monday it will start publishing the financial results of its augmented and virtual reality labs as a separate unit, where it is investing billions in its ambitions to build the “ metaverse ” and as it reported that its main advertising business faces “significant uncertainty.” Facebook, which reported third-quarter profit up 17 percent, warned that Apple Inc’s new privacy changes would weigh on its digital business in the current quarter. The social media company reported quarterly revenue below market expectations, which Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg told analysts was due to the iOS changes. David Wehner, Facebook’s chief financial officer, said the company expected its investment in its hardware division, Facebook Reality Labs, to reduce overall operating profit in 2021 by approximately $10 billion. https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png The financial commitment to this hardware-focused unit which will work on Facebook’s “metaverse” ambitions, comes as the company is swamped by coverage of documents leaked by former Facebook employee and whistleblower Frances Haugen which she said showed the company chose profit over user safety. read more CEO Mark Zuckerberg started Monday’s analyst call by issuing a defense against criticisms stemming from the documents, which he said painted a “false picture of our company.” The CEO has said Facebook in the coming years will be seen not as a social media firm but as a company focused on the metaverse. The buzzy term refers broadly to a shared virtual environment which can be accessed by people using different devices. read more Facebook, which has invested heavily in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), including buying companies like Oculus, this year created a product team to work on the metaverse. This month, it said it plans to hire 10,000 employees in Europe over the next five years to work on this initiative. read more “This is not an investment that is going to be profitable for us any time in the near future,” Zuckerberg told analysts. “But we basically believe that the metaverse is going to be the successor to the mobile internet.” Wehner said that starting in the fourth quarter of 2021, it would break out Facebook Reality Labs as a separate reporting segment from Facebook’s family of apps. Shares of the company were up about 1% in after-hours trade on Monday. Facebook, whose shares have gained about 20% so far this year, is about $85 billion away from regaining a spot on the $1 trillion club and joining new entrant Tesla Inc. RETOOLING The world’s largest social media network is under scrutiny from global lawmakers and regulators, including from the Federal Trade Commission which has filed an antitrust lawsuit alleging anticompetitive practices. The whistleblower documents, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, have intensified scrutiny of the company. They include internal research and reports about Instagram’s effects on the mental health of teens and about whether Facebook’s platforms stoke divisions, as well as its handling of activity around the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and inconsistencies in the company’s content moderation for users around the globe. read more For the third quarter, Facebook reported monthly active users of 2.91 billion, up 6% from a year ago but short of analysts’ estimates. On the call, executives emphasized the company’s focus on attracting young adults, including through its short video feature “Reels.” “We are retooling our teams to make serving young adults their North Star rather than optimizing for the larger number of older people,” said Zuckerberg, a shift he said would take “years, not months, to fully execute.” The leaked documents show Facebook’s ongoing concerns about its appeal to younger users, as rivals like TikTok have enjoyed popularity with teens. They also show the company’s difficulties in dealing with users who create multiple accounts on its platform. Facebook said it expects fourth-quarter revenue to be in a range of $31.5 billion to $34 billion. Analysts had forecast $34.84 billion in revenue, or a 24.1% jump, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Its third-quarter revenue too faced the brunt of Apple’s privacy rules that made it harder for brands to target and measure their ads on Facebook. Sandberg, the COO, said Facebook expects it will solve “more than half” of the problems that led to the under-reporting by the end of this year. “The changes to Apple privacy settings have not hurt Facebook in a major way, at least not yet,” said Haris Anwar, an analyst at Investing.com. “Though revenue and user numbers have taken a slight hit over the past quarter, the company’s earning power is still intact.” The company’s total revenue, which primarily consists of ad sales, rose to $29.01 billion in the third quarter from $21.47 billion a year earlier, missing analysts’ estimates of $29.57 billion. Sandberg said Facebook’s advertisers were also affected by the global supply-chain disruptions and labour shortages, which hurt advertising demand across a range of sectors and regions. Facebook said it repurchased $14.37 billion in stock during the third quarter and announced an additional $50 billion in share buybacks.","","indianexpress"

The senior completed 12 of 20 passes for 190 yards and four touchdowns as Herriman raced to the 28-7 halftime lead. All four of Herriman’s first-half TDs came on White TD passes, including a 59-yard to Kausai Hansen late in the second quarter. “After being injured for the last 4 weeks of the regular season, Jack has worked hard to get back on the field and it showed Friday against Davis. Has showed tremendous leadership and made very good decisions during the game. Four tosses to different receivers for touchdowns,” said Herriman coach Dustin Pearce. Girls Soccer Seven Castain, Waterford (Sr.) Seven Castain has been a lethal goal scorer all season for Waterford, so it’s no surprise that she did it again in last week’s 2A state championship game at Rio Tinto Stadium. The senior scored all four of Waterford’s goals as it edged Rowland Hall 4-3 in the final. “Seven undeniably positions herself for success. When she has a vision, she gets it done — she thinks, plans, works and then executes. She leads by example and sets a standard of excellence so high for our team that players have no choice but to keep pushing themselves to their limits. This approach has shown through her stats and accomplishments, and we have no doubt that her determination and grit, combined with her hard-earned skills, will carry her to success through college and beyond.” - Kimi Miyashima Castain finished the season scoring a state-record 71 goals and adding 18 assists in 17 games. Volleyball Levani Key, Bingham (So.) Bingham heads into the final week of the volleyball regular season on a roll with four straight victories and steady play of sophomore Levani Key has been one of the catalysts. For the season is hitting .282 with 215 kills. She’s first on the team with 34 aces and second on the team in digs with 140. “Levani is a headstrong player who goes into every game ready to take on any situation. She is a highly-coachable player who adapts well to the strategic obstacles volleyball has to offer, and finds a way to finish the job,” said Bingham coach Andrew Romero. “When she is asked to lead the team, the coaches can trust in her to take action and find a way to challenge the opponent and her teammates. Off the court, she brings a sense of joy to her teammates with her funny spirit, and her energy to cheer everyone on! She is respectful, a hard worker, and a positive role model in her family and on the team.” Girls Cross Country Carissa Hofeling, Cedar City (Sr.) Cedar City’s Carissa Hofeling has made huge strides as a runner this season and she’ll be among the top contenders at this week’s 4A state meet. Last Tuesday at the Region 10 championship at BicentennialPark in Cedar City, Hofeling ran away from the strong field of runners finishing with a great time of 17:22.60, which was 46 seconds faster than the runner-up finisher from Snow Canyon. “Carissa has been great since day one this season. She is positive, confident, and is driven to achieve impressive goals. This sets her apart from the competition,” said Cedar City coach Greg Harris. Hofeling finished 18th a year ago at the state meet, but a top 10 finish this year seems like a foregone conclusion based on her dominance of the region meet. Boys Cross Country Isaiah Crookston, Sky View (Jr.) Sky View’s Isaiah Crookston had a dominant performance at the Region 11 cross country championships at the Utah State cross-country champions on Oct. 20. The junior crossed the finish line in 15:59.5, which was 28 seconds faster than the next closest runner. “Isaiah is the definition of hard work. He is dedicated to improving and is willing to put in the time and effort to be successful. He loves to run and compete,” said Sky View coach John Womack. As a sophomore last year Crookston finished in 38th place at the state meet, a performance he’ll look to improve upon at this year’s 4A state championships. Girls Tennis Katelyn Steel, Morgan (Jr.) After having her first singles title aspirations come to an end in the semifinals in both her freshman and sophomores years, Katelyn Steel found a way to clear that semifinal obstacle this season. Not only did she win her semifinal match at the 3A state tournament earlier this month, she ended up prevailing in the championship match as well 6-1, 6-3. “She really is a confident girl. She’s got a really strong head and she stays positive even if she makes a mistake, and she’s very complimentary of all of her opponents. She doesn’t get down on herself,” said Morgan coach Katherine Hadley. “She’s a pretty mature girl, and she’s been that way even since she was a freshman, but she’s obviously getting better as she’s growing into her tennis. She’s mentally tough and positive and also has a lot of talent, she works really hard.” Thanks in large part to Steel’s march to the first singles final, she helped Morgan edge Grantsville by one point to claim a third straight team title. Boys Golf Sky Moon, Beaver (So.) Beaver sophomore Sky Moon had a dream week at the 2A state tournament last month. Not only did he lead his team to the 2A state title, but he also took home medalist honors with a very strong performance on the final day at the Roosevelt Golf Course back on Sept. 30. After shooting an 80 on the first day, he shot an even-par 72 on the final day to finish in first place with a two-stroke advantage. “Sky has a bright future ahead of him. He gained his size early on which is huge in golf,” said Beaver coach Jason Pollard. “When you can hit it that far and keep it in play it gave him a lot of scoring opportunities.”","2021-10-26 03:23:28","Football Jack White, Herriman (Sr.) Herriman quarterback Jack White delivered in the clutch to lead Herriman to the 35-21 first-round victory over Davis last week.

A two-time past champion in Vienna (2014 and 2016), Murray last got past one of the world’s top 10 players at the 2020 Western & Southern Open, when he defeated Alexander Zverev. On Monday, he squandered a match point in the second-set tiebreaker but came back to claim the third set. The result hurts Hurkacz’s chances of making the Nitto ATP Finals. Hurkacz currently sits in the ninth and final qualifying spot for the year-end event. Others who won first-round matches Monday were third-seeded Matteo Berrettini of Italy, Georgia’s Nikoloz Basilashvili, Spain’s Carlos Alcaraz and Australia’s Alex De Minaur. St. Petersburg Open Eighth-seeded Sebastian Korda of the United States recorded the only service break of the match in the penultimate game as he beat Croatia’s Nino Serdarusic 7-6 (2), 7-5 in the first round at St. Petersburg, Russia. Following a break-free first set, Korda jumped on top 5-0 in the tiebreaker and cruised from there. Korda never faced a break point in the match, but he converted only one of his seven break opportunities. Elsewhere in opening-round action, seventh-seeded Alexander Bublik of Kazakhstan beat Russia’s Evgenii Tiurnev 6-3, 6-4, and Germany’s Jan-Lennard Struff got past Australia’ James Duckworth 7-6 (3), 6-3. –Field Level Media","","nationalpost"

SAN ISIDRO (Argentina), Oct 26 — Diego Maradona’s former lawyer said yesterday the medical treatment given to his client was “very bad”, after giving testimony in the investigation into the death of the Argentine football star.“There were many mistakes made because Diego died, they inflated and inflated the poor guy until his heart exploded,” Matias Morla told reporters after his more than three hours of testimony at the prosecutor’s office in San Isidro.Authorities in the northern suburb of Buenos Aires are investigating the circumstances of Maradona’s death.The medical treatment Maradona received was “very bad, that’s why he died,” Morla said.Maradona died of a heart attack on November 25 aged 60 while recovering from an operation to remove a blood clot from his head.He also suffered from kidney and liver problems, heart failure, neurological deterioration and alcohol and drug addictions.The late football great had been recovering in a private residence under the supervision of a seven-person medical team.The team members have already testified in the investigation to determine whether there was any neglect or malpractice in Maradona’s care.Morla said that during his last visit with Maradona on November 16, “he had a strange voice, robotic, very high-pitched and intermittent.“I informed everyone of Diego’s condition,” Morla said. “I then realised it was because of the amount of water retained in his body.”The lawyer denounced as “crazy” the family’s decision to have Maradona recover outside of a hospital.Maradona “had no reason to go to a house when the doctors said he had to stay in a clinic,” Morla said, adding he believed his client had been “abandoned by his daughters.”“But one thing is moral responsibility and another is legal responsibility.”Maradona’s two older daughters, Dalma and Gianinna, were accused in August of harassing Morla online. — AFP","2021-10-26 03:22:37","","","malaymail"

The post These Humidifiers and Purifiers Are Currently on Sale So You Can Breathe Easier appeared first on Lifehacker Australia.","Air purifiers and air humidifiers have been quietly increasing in popularity because of their myriad of benefits. From helping with allergies and asthma to alleviating dry skin and headaches, it’s no wonder people are heading out to buy them and see the effects for themselves. If you’ve been looking for an excuse to try one out, Amazon’s latest purifier and humidifier sale is the sign you’ve been looking for. In this article, we’ve given a quick rundown on the main purpose of each before rounding up the best products currently on sale. READ MORE Here's Why You Should Have a Humidifier in Your Home What’s the difference between a purifier and a humidifier? While they sound fairly similar, these devices actually serve two completely different purposes, so which one you buy will depend on your needs. An air purifier works to remove contaminants from the air within a room to improve indoor air quality. They’re often beneficial to people who suffer from allergies or asthma, as they suck any irritants from the air before you breathe it in. Because indoor air can contain pollutant levels up to five times higher than outdoor air – it’s no wonder people are flocking to buy purifiers. An air humidifier, on the other hand, is a device that emits water vapour or steam to increase moisture levels in the air and prevent dryness. Put simply — it’s designed to increase humidity (the amount of moisture) in the air. They’re used to alleviate things like dry skin, dry throats, cracked lips, sinus congestion, headaches and nose irritations. They can also be used to help symptoms associated with the flu and common cold and have even been suggested to lower the risk of coronavirus transmission. Discounted Air Purifiers Breville The Easy Air Purifier $189 (was $251.90, save 26.05) When you think of Breville, air purifiers probably aren’t the products that come to mind, but this product has received rave reviews among customers. With a 360-degree air circulation design, 4-stage air purification and night mode – it’s fitted with all the bells and whistles to give you a comfortable night’s sleep. Arovec H13 True HEPA Air Purifier $164.89 (with $15 off coupon) The Arovec True HEPA Air Purifier AV-P152 is an affordable air purifying system that improves indoor air quality in the home and helps the whole family breathe easier all year round. With its compact design, you can easily move the unit from room to room. It doesn’t take up much space so you’ll easily find a safe place to put it. 2-in-1 Humidifier and Aroma Diffuser, $99.89 (with $20 off coupon) This device lasts up to 30 hours and gives off an ultrasonic cool mist. It has an LED touch panel, night light and auto shut-off capabilities, so it’s your perfect sleeping companion. Herilios Air Purifier currently $84.99, usually $99.99 If you’re looking for a way to feel refreshed and revitalized, the Herilios Air Purifier is a must-have.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Jimmy Butler kept getting to the rim, and predictably, scoring suddenly became pretty easy. Butler scored 36 points on 15-for-21 shooting, Bam Adebayo added 16 points and 13 rebounds and the Miami Heat pulled away in the fourth quarter to beat the Orlando Magic 107-90 on Monday night. ""Jimmy is an elite scorer. He's also an elite playmaker and he's an elite defender,"" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""He can do a lot of different things."" Butler had 10 baskets from inside of 10 feet. He was 13 for 32 in the season's first two games. ""I shot the same shots. They just happened to go in tonight,"" Butler said. ""Let my defense lead to my offense. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Markieff Morris had 16 points off the Miami bench, and Tyler Herro finished with 13 points, five rebounds and nine assists for the Heat. Miami was 19 for 19 from the foul line, tying the second-most makes without a miss in team history. The Heat were 30 for 30 against Boston on March 24, 1993. Franz Wagner and Jalen Suggs led Orlando with 15 points, while Cole Anthony and R.J. Hampton each added 12 for the Magic. Mo Bamba and Robin Lopez had 11 apiece for Orlando. ""We’re a very young team,"" Hampton said. ""Going up against very experienced teams like New York, like Miami, like San Antonio, that’s going to benefit us."" Butler also had five steals. He had 11 field goals — a career best for the opening two quarters of a game — by halftime, the majority of those dunks or layups, and the Heat led by as many as 19 in the early going before taking a 57-44 lead into the break. Orlando, which rallied from a double-digit deficit to win in New York on Sunday night, tried to do it again in Miami. Anthony had five consecutive points midway through the third quarter to get Orlando within six, and another score from Anthony cut Miami’s lead to 86-77 early in the fourth. That’s when the Heat pulled away for good. A 12-2 run started with a basket by Herro, ended with him unintentionally banking in a 3-pointer with a big smile, and the lead was restored to 98-79 with 6:47 left. ""I don’t want to make excuses,"" Magic coach Jamahl Mosley said. ""We all laced them up, ready to get out there and play. I think we started a little bit slow, then we got our momentum ... and we kept fighting."" TIP-INS Magic: Orlando started last season with three consecutive road wins, but has won back-to-back road games only once since. ... The Magic have been trailing by double digits for 99 of the 192 minutes that they’ve played so far this season, or 52% of the time. Heat: Kyle Lowry had nine points and eight assists. ... Duncan Robinson appeared in his 150th consecutive game, the fifth-longest streak in Heat history. He’s eight games shy of matching Adebayo for the fourth-best streak and 24 games away from Glen Rice’s franchise record. ... Butler became the first Heat player to have at least 24 points and at least four steals by halftime. LUCKIER 13 Butler was a combined 5 for 13 in first halves of Miami’s first two games. He was 11 for 13 in the first half Monday. VEGAS REUNION The game was a reunion of some key parts of the USA Basketball Select Team that trained against the Olympic team in Las Vegas this summer. Spoelstra and Mosley were involved in coaching that team, and Herro played for the selects. ""Having Tyler with the USA Select team, I understand his level of confidence, his level of being able to score at a high clip,"" Mosley said. UP NEXT Magic: Host Charlotte on Wednesday.

The news came as the United Nations climate office warned that the world remains off-target for meeting its goal of cutting emissions as part of international efforts to curb global warming. Both announcements came days before the start of a U.N. climate change conference in Glasgow, Scotland. Many environmental activists, policymakers and scientists say the Oct. 31-Nov. 12 event, known as COP26 for short, marks an important and even crucial opportunity for concrete commitments to the targets set out in the 2015 Paris climate accord. “The Greenhouse Gas Bulletin contains a stark, scientific message for climate change negotiators at COP26,” World Meteorological Organization Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said of his agency's annual report on heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere. “At the current rate of increase in greenhouse gas concentrations, we will see a temperature increase by the end of this century far in excess of the Paris agreement targets of 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius (2.7-3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.” According to the report, concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide were all above levels in the pre-industrial era before 1750, when human activities “started disrupting Earth's natural equilibrium.” The report draws on information collected by a network that monitors the amount of greenhouse gases that remain in the atmosphere after some quantities are absorbed by oceans and the biosphere. In its report, the Geneva-based agency also pointed to signs of a worrying new development: Parts of the Amazon rainforest have gone from being a carbon “sink” that sucks carbon dioxide from the air to a source of CO2 due to deforestation and reduced humidity in the region, it said. “One of the striking messages from our report is that the Amazonian region, which used to be a sink of carbon, has become a source of carbon dioxide,"" Taalas said. “And that's because of deforestation. It's because of changes of the global local climate, especially. We have less humidity and less rainfall.” Oksana Tarasova, chief of WMO's atmospheric and environment research division, said the results showing the Amazon going from sink to source were a first, but he noted they were from a specific southeastern portion of the Amazon, not the entire rainforest. The U.N. climate office said separately Monday that its assessment of the formal commitments made by countries that signed up to the Paris accord suggests the world could reduce its emissions by 83-88% by 2050 compared with 2019. More worryingly, emissions in 2030 are projected to be 16% higher than in 2010, based on formal pledges so far. “Such an increase, unless changed quickly, may lead to a temperature rise of about 2.7C (4.9F) by the end of the century,” the U.N. said. Experts argued that emissions must halve by 2030 compared with 2010 levels and essentially hit zero by mid-century, if the Paris goal of capping global warming at 2C, ideally no more than 1.5C, is to be achieved. “Overshooting the temperature goals will lead to a destabilized world and endless suffering, especially among those who have contributed the least to the GHG emissions in the atmosphere,” said Patricia Espinosa, who heads the U.N. climate office. “We are nowhere near where science says we should be,” she added. Alok Sharma, who will preside over the U.N. talks in Glasgow, said progress had been made since the Paris deal was struck in 2015, when projections of existing emissions cuts pointed to warming of up to 4C. The global average concentration of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, hit a new high of 413.2 parts per million last year, according to the WMO report. The 2020 increase was higher than the annual average over the last decade despite a 5.6% drop in carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels due to COVID-19 restrictions, WMO said. Taalas said a level above 400 parts per million which was breached in 2015 -- “has major negative repercussions for our daily lives and well-being, for the state of our planet and for the future of our children and grandchildren.” Human-incurred carbon dioxide emissions, which result mostly from burning fossil fuels like oil and gas or from cement production, amount to about two-thirds of the warming effect on the climate. WMO said overall, an economic retreat last year because of the pandemic “did not have any discernible impact on the atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases and their growth rates, although there was a temporary decline in new emissions.”","","indiatoday"

Delonte West has been in the tabloids these past few years for reasons that aren’t all too positive to say the least. He was first seen in a rather comprising situation in 2016 when pictures surfaced on Twitter suggesting that he was homeless. Fast-forward to 2020, he was video-taped near an intersection in Dallas. Dallas Mavericks owner, Mark Cuban, took it upon himself to see to it that Delonte West was taken care of for the time being, placing him in a rehabilitation facility last year. It was even reported earlier this year that West had gotten a job at the same rehab facility he was staying at.

Delonte West rants on about being better than LeBron James and Michael Jordan. According to reports, Delonte was banging on his neighbor’s doors while holding two open containers of alcohol recently. This led to the police being called on him and his subsequent arrest. During his arrest, West would say things like, “I’m better than LeBron James and Michael Jordan! Shut the f*** up!” West would also then go on to spew out a homophobic rant while also claiming that he’s the president of the United States. Delonte West says he’s Jesus, president of the United States and better than LeBron and Jordan “N*gga, I was better than LeBron James. I’m better than [Michael] Jordan.

The 14-day campaign is timed to lead up to the COP 26 meetings in Scotland next month, where world leaders will gather to discuss their latest steps to try to keep climate change in check. While the demonstrations affect drivers in Vancouver, the group says their focus is to put pressure on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. “We are calling upon Justin to end the $18 billion of subsidies that he gives to very rich fossil fuel companies every single year. That’s taxpayer dollars that could be used for transitioning us to a green economy,” organizer Brian Eichler told CityNews just before the series of protests launched. He said while they hope to convince all levels of government to take action on climate change, they feel their message still isn’t getting through. “We’re going to continue this until we do, and we’re never going to stop. We are completely dedicated to this cause.

"Sony's Xperia Pro-I is a $1,800 phone with a 1-inch camera sensor","https://www.engadget.com/sony-xperia-pro-i-announcement-031222484.html?src=rss","['Consumer Discretionary', 'Cameras & Photography', 'Technology & Electronics', 'site|engadget', 'provider_name|Engadget', 'region|US', 'language|en-US', 'author_name|Igor Bonifacic']","","","At the start of 2021, Sony introduced the $2,500 Xperia Pro. It was a phone the company made for video professionals. Now, Sony is back with a second professional-grade smartphone designed to appeal to photography enthusiasts. The headline feature of the Xperia Pro-I is a 1-inch sensor borrowed from the company's RX100 VII point-and-shoot camera. That's a much larger sensor than you'll find on most phones. To put things in perspective, the primary sensor on the Pixel 6 Pro features a pixel pitch of 1.2µm. By contrast, the main sensor on the Pro-I has 2.4µm-sized pixels, making it much better in low light. It can also shoot 12-bit RAW files and native 4K video at 120 frames per second with eye-detection auto-focus. Speaking of auto-focus, it comes with 315 points that cover 90 percent of the frame.The Pro-I also includes one of Sony's BIONZ X imaging processors, giving it the ability to shoot up to 20 frames per second with both auto-focus and auto-exposure enabled. The fast readout speed of the sensor allows it to avoid a rolling shutter effect, a feature Sony says helps the Pro-I stand out from other phones with 1-inch sensors like the Mi 11 Ultra. Those handsets also don't have phase-detection autofocus like the Pro-I does.Complimenting the 1-inch sensor is a 24mm lens made from glass that can switch between f/2.0 and f/4.0 apertures. Sony went with an aspherical design to make the optics as small as possible. Flanking the primary camera is a 16mm ultrawide camera and a 50mm telephoto camera. Sony says it chose that lens arrangement after consulting with photographers who told the company they wanted a setup that matched their collection of prime lenses.Once you get past its camera, the Xperia Pro-I is essentially a souped-up Xperia 1 III. Internally, the phone features a Snapdragon 888 supported by 12GB of RAM and 512GB of internal storage. You can add up to 1TB of additional storage with the help of a microSD card. Powering everything is a 4,500mAh battery Sony claims will allow you to use the Pro-I for a full day on a single charge. Inside the box is a 30W power adapter that can charge the phone to 50 percent in 30 minutes.The Pro-I also features the same 6.5-inch OLED that came on the Xperia 1 III. It's a 4K display with a 120Hz refresh rate and 21:9 aspect ratio. On the audio front, the Pro-I not only comes with a 3.5mm headphone jack, but it also includes Sony's LDAC and DSEE technologies.All of those capabilities come with a hefty price tag. In the US, Sony plans to sell the Xperia Pro-I for the eye-watering price of $1,800. The way the company sees it, you're effectively getting a flagship phone and RX100 VII for less than the price of buying those devices separately. However, the Xperia Pro-I isn't a one-to-one replacement for the RX100 VII. Sony's point-and-camera outputs images at 20.1-megapixel, using the full readout from its sensor. The Pro-I uses a crop because taking advantage of the entire sensor would necessitate a much larger lens than would be feasible to include on a smartphone. Pre-orders for the Xperia Pro-I open on October 28th, with general availability to follow in December.  ","","2021-10-26 03:12:22","","","engadget"
"Indiana city offering an incentive to get new neighbors to move there","https://www.wcpo.com/news/national/indiana-city-offering-5-000-grandparents-service-to-entice-people-to-move-there","","","","A recent report by tech platform, Growmotely, found that 74% of professionals think remote work will become the new normal.","GREENSBURG, Ind. (KRTV) — Greensburg, Indiana has a population of just under 12,000 people, but city leaders are hoping it will soon grow.A recent report by tech platform Growmotely details 74% of professionals “think remote work will become the new normal.”Greensburg is one of the dozens of cities across the U.S. looking to capitalize on that.“This hometown atmosphere is contagious,” Greensburg Mayor Joshua Marsh said.The “Tree City” is most famous for a tree growing out of the roof of its courthouse, and it is willing to pay for new neighbors to plant roots.“[We are looking for] somebody interested in investing and spending time here, being a part of our nonprofits and other agencies, and enjoying our community,” Marsh said.The offer: $7,000 in cash and gifts for remote workers age 18 and older to call Greensburg home.“We’re focused on individuals who work remotely, high wages income earners that live outside of Indiana,” Marsh said.If accepted, the new neighbors will receive up to $5,000 in reimbursement for moving costs, a year-long membership to the YMCA, a literal seat at the table during community events, and “Grammy Tami.”“We still aren’t done being parents and loving on kids,” Tami Wenning said. Both her and her husband, Dan, a school bus driver, are serving as “Grandparents on Demand.” Tami is also the Executive director at the Decatur County Community Foundation.The couple will be available to babysit and come to the school’s Grandparents Day.“Some people say I would never trust my child with someone I don’t know, but a community our size, everybody knows everybody and if you’ve ever done something bad, somebody will tell on ya,” Wenning said.Growing up, Wenning said she moved all around the county and knows just how scary it can be to start over in a new place.“I want people to feel comfortable coming here and instantly feel like they have some family. Somebody to at least call,” Wenning said.Marsh said the ‘why’ behind this incentive will help diversify the workforce and raise the average income level. It is also an effort to grow the population, increase the tax base and attract new businesses to town.“I think it’s incredibly important for rural Indiana communities to embrace those that aren’t from here and I think that’s an important component for our long-term success,” Marsh said.The Tree City is looking to start with sponsoring five individuals. So far, Mayor Marsh said more than 800 applications were submitted.There is no deadline to apply for Greensburg. Those interested can apply online here.This story was originally reported by Nikki DeMentri on wrtv.com.","2021-10-26 03:12:01","","","wcpo"

Sangha burst into the spotlight last summer after a superb performance in the Big Bash League , claiming 21 wickets in 15 matches at 18.28. No spinner took more wickets in the T20 tournament than the 19-year-old, who finished his maiden season with the Sydney Thunder as the club’s highest wicket-taker. Watch Live Coverage of the 21/22 Marsh One-Day Cup Live & Free on Kayo Freebies. No Credit Card. No Brainer. Join Now National selectors rewarded Sangha by including him in Australia’s squad for a one-day tour to New Zealand in February. He was also selected as a reserve player for recent white-ball tours of the West Indies and Bangladesh, but the talented leg-spinner is yet to make his international debut. Sangha’s pre-season was restricted by Covid-19 guidelines in his LGA, but the teenager impressed New South Wales coach Phil Jaques during last week’s intra-squad trial match at Hurstville Oval. “He’s an exciting talent, as we’ve seen in the Big Bash last year,” Jaques told reporters on Thursday. “He’s obviously been on a few tours with Australia, he’s learnt heaps doing that, rubbing shoulder with some of the best players in the world. “I’m really excited to see how he starts the season … He’s certainly good enough, and it would be great to see how he goes if he’s given a chance. “He’s been getting better and better as these past few trial games have gone ahead.” On Friday, Sangha was named in the Blues’ 13-player squad for this week’s Sheffield Shield season opener against Victoria at Sydney’s Drummoyne Oval. Patterson, who has replaced veteran wicketkeeper Peter Nevill as New South Wales captain, confirmed that Sangha was on the verge of a first-class debut. “You kind of forget how good he is to be honest,” Patterson told reporters at Drummoyne Oval on Tuesday morning. “He’s an exceptional bowler, and we’ve seen in Big Bash how poised he is for a young leg spinner with serious world-class players that come at him, and how he’s able to manage himself is a tremendous skill. “Obviously four-day cricket is a little bit different, but what we’ve seen is that he’s absolutely ready to be our first-choice spinner when Nathan does leave. “There’s certainly opportunities that will come up, whether that’s across red ball or white ball stuff, we’ll just have to wait and see, but he’s in the mix.” Patterson said the Blues would “definitely consider” selecting both Sangha and Australian spinner Nathan Lyon in the same starting XI, but a final call would largely depend on the conditions. “The great thing is at the moment we’ve got options,” he said. “We’ve got options if they leave grass on it, we’ve got options if it is more bare. “I think the flexibility that we’ve got will allow us to make that decision.” Sangha represented Australia at the U19 Cricket World Cup in South Africa last year, where he was comfortably the team’s highest wicket-taker with 15 scalps at 11.46 and an economy rate of 3.58. The Sheffield Shield clash between New South Wales and Victoria will get underway on Wednesday, with the first ball scheduled for 10.30am AEDT.

Mujeeb stole the show with his fifer as Afghanistan thrashed Scotland by 130 runs in the Group 2 match. If Mujeeb picked five, Rashid Khan took four wickets to dismantle Scotland batting as the five batsmen registered ducks during the chase. ""The world knows we have some good spinners in the form of Rashid and Mujeeb, they've played everywhere in the world. We have a very good team combination,"" Nabi told the host broadcaster Star Sports after the match. ""When we play the local tournaments, I, Mujeeb and Rashid are the most expensive bowlers. Mujeeb is playing his first T20 World Cup match and he got the Player of the Match award, that's good to see, it's fantastic,"" he added. Opting to bat first, Afghanistan scored 190/4 at the end of 20 overs. Najibullah Zadran was dismissed on the final ball of the innings after he smashed 59 off 34 balls to steer Afghanistan to 190. Nabi said Afghanistan's aim was to put on a big total on board and he was glad the team executed things as per the plan. ""It's important to win at the start of the tournament. This was our plan, to bat first and post a big total. Both the openers started well, we finished the powerplay on a good note,"" said Nabi.

Other participants include the Malaysian Technology Development Corporation (MTDC), which is wholly-owned by Khazanah Nasional Berhad, the Malaysian government’s sovereign wealth fund; ZB Capital Limited; and angel investors. Founded in 2016 by Cheong Jin Xi, Poladrone now operates in Malaysia and Thailand and plans to expand into Indonesia, the world’s largest oil palm producer. Cheong told TechCrunch that Poladrone is profitable, but decided to seek funding after the COVID-19 pandemic hit and “highlighted the positive impact our technology has on agriculture communities by creating jobs and upskilling opportunities.” Indonesian agritech platform TaniHub Group harvests a $65.5M Series B round Adoption of Poladrone’s drones also increased during labor shortages caused by the pandemic, and the startup grew its team from 20 people to over 80 in less than a year to meet demand. Its seed round will be used for more hiring and to scale operations and build more Service Centers in agricultural areas, where clients can buy equipment and spare parts. Cheong first became interested in drones when he was a high school student in Melbourne, Australia, and it led to him pursuing an aerospace engineering degree at university. After Cheong returned to Malaysia, he began looking at potential applications for drone technology and realized “the agriculture industry made perfect sense,” because drones can fly over large terrains to perform repetitive tasks autonomously, and their cameras also capture a large amount of data. Cheong’s interest in agritech was also inspired by growing up in Kuala Lipis, an agricultural town in the state of Pahang. Many of his family members and relatives are involved in farming, and his early insights went into the development of Poladrone’s products. Rhinoceros beetles are a serious problem during the first three years of an oil palm’s 25 year lifecycle, he said, because attacks hurt trees’ growth, delaying them from reaching maturity and sometimes killing plants. “The issue is that once the surrounding oil palms matures, replanting is no longer possible which means that any space wasted on a dead palm would be wasted for the next 22 years,” Cheong said. As a result, oil palm farms usually need to perform preventative pesticide spraying every two weeks for the first two years after oil palms are planted, then every month until they mature. This is often done by workers with knapsack sprayers or on tractors. One of Poladrone’s Service Centers In 2020, the company launched Oryctes, developed with support from Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation, for precision spot spraying of rhinoceros beetles and other pests. It also recently launched Mist Drone, which blanket sprays open field crops, like paddies, corn and bananas. Most of the oil palm farms Poladrone works with are mid-to-large size, or about 5,000 hectares and above. “Data analytics and automation becomes extremely important for farms once they reach this scale,” Cheong said. He added that oil palm farms cover 18.7 million hectares around the world, and Poladrone sees a serviceable addressable market of 4.2 million hectares in Malaysia alone, worth over $1.3 billion per year. The company is also planning to expand its reach to other types of crops, like rice, corn and sugarcane. In addition to selling its products, Poladrone’s Service Centers also provide repairs, training and workshops, with the goal of increasing drone adoption. Cheong said it typically takes one week of training before workers start using Poladrone’s equipment, which can be operated from smartphones. In statement about investment, Wavemaker Partners general partner Gavin Lee said, “Poladrone now works with eight out of 10 of the biggest palm oil farms in Malaysia—an impressive feat that gives us confidence to back the team and their vision of propelling Southeast Asia’s agriculture industry.” Warehouse drones take flight","2021-10-26 03:11:37","Rhinoceros beetles are one of the greatest threats to oil palm crops , attacking plants while they are young and potentially lowering a farm’s yield for years.

"Looking for fantasy football edge? Target D/STs that create turnovers","https://nypost.com/2021/10/25/fantasy-football-turnover-creating-defense-can-give-an-edge/","","['Fantasy Alarm']","","The trick to streaming the right defense this week isn’t just about looking at who is playing a worse team.","The trick to streaming the right defense this week isn’t just about looking at who is playing a worse team.","2021-10-26 03:11:27","As the sun rises this Tuesday morning, the fantasy football community can emerge from its bunker and start to move forward with the rest of the season. NFL Week 7, appropriately named “Byemageddon,” has passed, and most of us are no worse for the wear. Some teams did suffer losses in the wake of six teams being off, but that is just the nature of the game. If we want to take solace in something, find the silver lining, it is how we escaped the week without any significant injuries. Rarely does that happen and, as a result, it allows us to focus on other areas regarding roster maintenance. Instead of hunting for the new flavor-of-the-week running back or wide receiver, we can turn our attention to streaming defenses. The trick to streaming the right defense this week isn’t just about looking at who is playing a worse team. Depending on your scoring, points and yards allowed can be an important factor, but where you really want to look is the turnovers. That’s your bread and butter. Quarterback sacks are also big because they lead to turnovers, but interceptions, forced fumbles and fumble recoveries are where you need to pay the most attention. You should focus your attention on teams like the Bills, Colts, Cowboys, Cardinals and Buccaneers. They lead the league in takeaways, and Dallas has actually taken three interceptions and turned them into defensive touchdowns. The Bucs have done it twice. Not only do you need to look at how many takeaways a defensive unit has, but also how many giveaways we see from the opposing team. The Chiefs, Jets, Jaguars and Texans are most guilty of turning the ball over, but Miami, Washington, Carolina and Chicago aren’t far behind. The more they “give,” the more your defense can “take,” which just increases their odds of scoring. While many of the top defenses are being hoarded by their owners, you can still find plenty in Week 8. Atlanta will feast on Sam Darnold and the Panthers, the Bengals will get the Jets with backup quarterback Mike White, and Seattle will host the struggling Jaguars. The Monday night game between the Giants and Chiefs pits two turnover-prone teams against each other, and even the Chargers make for a good play against New England, which ranks third in giveaways. Even if points or yards allowed matters in your scoring, a team defense can win a week for you if they dominate the turnover battle. Don’t be afraid to switch things up. Each week you should always be able to find someone with a favorable matchup. Howard Bender is the VP of operations and head of content at FantasyAlarm.com .

Kobe Bryant was one of the greatest players to have played in the league. His sheer competitive spirit and the crazy passion for being the best version of himself at any given time was what set him apart from his opponents. Bean dedicated uncountable hours in the gym to perfect his craft, helping him reach the pinnacle of the game. Because of this, Bryant is one of the most accomplished players of all time. For over two long decades, the Black Mamba kept preaching his famous Mamba Mentality, while instilling the same mentality in all of his fans from around the world. For anyone who followed Kobe’s career would instantly get inspired by the various little things he would do, in order to be the best. Also Read: Steph Curry and other NBA legends from different era discuss the Goats’ greatness There was virtually no defender in the league the Hall-Of-Famer didn’t get buckets on. JJ Redick was one of the many who Bryant managed to get the better of on the offensive end. JJ Redick calls Kevin Durant the “modern version” of Kobe Bryant Just like Kobe, Kevin Durant too is one of the most prolific scorers in league history. Because of his incredibly deep offensive arsenal, KD has been able to torch the league for 14 years now. With career averages of 27 points, 7.1 rebounds and 4.2 assists, The Durantuala is easily one of the greatest players we have ever witnessed. And being a once-in-a-generation type of player, Durant is frequently compared to the greats like Kobe and even Michael Jordan. Recently, it was JJ Redick who compared Kevin to the great Kobe Bryant. After speaking about the horrific experience of guarding Bryant, JJ explained how the Nets star was the “modern version” of Bean. Redick said on his podcast: “Guarding Kobe Bryant was sort of like an exercise in futility. There was nothing you could do defensively to stop him. He was either going to make the shot or miss the shot.” “I feel as if Kevin Durant is the modern version of Kobe. There’s not a whole lot you can do to stop him. He’s got the handle, got the jumper, he’s got everything he can do.” Also Read: Jay Z tries to recruit Hornets star to Nets during on-court discussion JJ, who has played with both the superstars, surely knows what he is talking about.

Yellen “frankly raised issues of concern,” the U.S. Treasury later said in a short separate statement, which did not elaborate on the concerns but added that Yellen looked forward to future discussions with Liu. Both sides said it was important for the two countries to strengthen communication and coordination on macroeconomic policies, according to the Chinese side’s readout. China also expressed its concerns over U.S. tariffs and the fair treatment of Chinese companies, it said. Liu, who has led China’s negotiations in Sino-U.S. trade talks since former U.S. President Donald Trump embarked on a trade war with Beijing, has held talks with both Yellen and U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai earlier this year. Increased engagement between the trade and economic chiefs of the world’s largest economies since Joe Biden became U.S. president in January comes even as the U.S. administration criticizes Beijing on human rights abuses and seeks to rally other rich nations to form a united front against China. Earlier in October, Tai pledged to exclude some Chinese imports from tariffs while pressing Beijing over its failure to keep some promises made in a “Phase 1” trade deal made under the Trump administration.

Former Bomber Barry Davis recalls, playing for North Melbourne at the time, recalls, “They had to get down on hands and knees and go right around the whole 400 metres, twice.” “You think the players enjoyed that? I don’t think so.” Geoff Pryor remembered the incident, noting, “He asked us to crawl around the oval.” “I thought there was very little benefit in trying to do that. What it reflected was the deep feeling ‘Tuddy’ had and the frustration.” Another former player, Ken Fletcher, told the historian Dan Eddy that Tuddenham, “lost every single player for the way he treated us that day”. “And if everyone had not got down and done it, then no-one would’ve played the next week. None of us liked doing it, but we all did it. It was really degrading. “The most degrading thing I have ever done in my life, in fact.” Tuddenham himself admits the move was “one of those spontaneous decisions that you make”, born of a performance in which the side conceded 14 goals in a quarter to the Blues. “I was angry and I couldn’t sleep all night. I got to the ground and said ‘Right, you’re on your hands and knees, crawl halfway today and lets get going again, that was a pathetic performance’,” he said. “But then I said go down and get a couple of slabs of beer and let the players open up and I sat back and let them fire at me, which was good. “They won the next four games!” Episodes three and four of The Bombers: Stories of a Great Club air on Fox Footy tonight (7:30pm AEST), with seven half-hour episodes leading to a one-hour finale.","","foxsports"

BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Oct 26 — Southeast Asian leaders kicked off an Asean summit today but Myanmar refused to send a representative after being angered by the bloc’s decision to exclude the country’s junta chief.The virtual gathering marked the start of three days of meetings hosted by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, with US President Joe Biden as well as Chinese and Russian leaders set to attend.Myanmar topped the agenda of today's talks between regional leaders, with the country still in chaos following February’s military takeover and the subsequent deadly crackdown on dissent.Facing calls to defuse the crisis, Asean, which includes Myanmar, has drawn up a roadmap aimed at restoring peace but there have been doubts over the junta’s commitment to the plan.Its refusal to let a special envoy meet ousted civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi prompted the bloc to exclude junta chief Min Aung Hlaing from this week’s summit.The coup snuffed out Myanmar’s short-lived experiment with democracy, with Nobel laureate Suu Kyi now facing a raft of charges in a junta court that could see her jailed for decades.Min Aung Hlaing’s exclusion was an unprecedented snub from an organisation often criticised for being toothless, and was slammed by the junta as a breach of the bloc’s policy of non-interference in member states’ affairs.The 10-member group had invited Chan Aye, director-general of the junta-appointed foreign affairs ministry, in the chief’s place.But a junta spokesman said yesterday that sending a more junior figure could “affect our country’s sovereignty and image”, and no Myanmar representative was present at the opening of the virtual summit.‘Asean divided’Aaron Connelly, a Southeast Asia expert from the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the decision to bar the junta chief was “tremendously significant”.“It is the most significant sanction that Asean has ever handed to a member state, and it is in direct response to the non-compliance that we have seen from the (junta),” he told a panel discussion yesterday.But observers think it unlikely the bloc will go further, such as by suspending Myanmar, and see little chance of decisions at this week’s meetings that could prompt a change of course from the junta.“Asean is divided over the issue of Myanmar... There will unlikely be any real progress,” a Southeast Asian diplomat, speaking anonymously, told AFP.While member states including Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia have pushed for the bloc to take action, others with more authoritarian governments have been less vocal.Other issues likely to be discussed include the South China Sea — where Beijing and several Southeast Asian countries have overlapping claims — and the coronavirus pandemic, as much of the region emerges from an outbreak.This year’s meetings are hosted by Brunei and are taking place online due to virus-related travel difficulties.After the Southeast Asian leaders hold talks today, Biden will take part in a US-Asean summit later in the day, and in a summit including Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and other world leaders Wednesday.It is the first time in four years that a US president has attended the Asean summits, as Biden seeks to rally support in the region against a rising China. — AFP","2021-10-26 03:07:54","","","malaymail"

The phone will be available for preorder starting October 28 and will be sold unlocked starting in December 2021 in the US, though availability in other regions hasn't been announced. </p><p>The Xperia Pro-I (‘I’ for imaging) has nearly all the perks of its predecessor and a few improvements of its own at a lower price – $1,799 / £1,599 (around AU$2,400), compared to the staggering $2,500 (around £1,830 / AU$3,245) price tag of the Xperia Pro. The new Pro-I doesn’t have the HDMI port central to the Xperia Pro’s use as an external display for expensive professional cameras, so it’s more a general use phone built for videographers. </p><p>The Xperia Pro-I does have an improved main camera with a 1-inch sensor. It’s one of the first mainstream phones to have a sensor of that size (and the first coming to the US), which enables better low-light performance, dynamic range, and more natural depth-of-field compared to the computational bokeh seen in phones with smaller sensors. The main camera's dual aperture lens, which lets you switch between f/2.0 and f/4.0, gives you added control over this background blur.</p><p>The megapixel count hasn’t changed from the Pro – all three rear cameras are 12MP, so the main, telephoto, and ultra-wide cameras aren’t improved in that regard. But the Xperia Pro-I has other improvements on the standard Pro, like having 315 points of autofocus (the green grid of boxes shown when taking photos) covering 90% of the viewfinder, compared to 247 points on the Xperia Pro covering 70% of the viewfinder. The phone can also take burst shots up to 20 frames per second with autofocus, as well as improved anti-distortion over earlier Xperia models.</p><p>Other than its rearranged rear camera block, the Xperia Pro-I is physically similar to the Xperia Pro, though it does bump the chipset up to the Snapdragon 888 found in this year’s flagship Android phones. It has the same 6.5-inch OLED display as the Xperia 1 III, though that should be fine for most smartphone owners – its 4K resolution (3840 x 1644) is rare among modern smartphones. </p><p>It packs a 4,500mAh battery and 30W charger, as well as the Xperia I III’s front-facing speakers as well as a 3.5mm headphone jack.

"US, as well as the World, will Soon Experience Hyperinflation, Says Jack Dorsey CEO of Twitter","https://joplinbusinessjournal.com/2021/10/26/us-as-well-as-the-world-will-soon-experience-hyperinflation-says-jack-dorsey-ceo-of-twitter/","['News']","['Uzoma Chinaka']","","Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter, one of the world’s largest social media platforms, made a horrifying prediction relating to the world’s economy on Friday 22nd, 2021.

Read more","Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter, one of the world’s largest social media platforms, made a horrifying prediction relating to the world’s economy on Friday 22nd, 2021. The renowned CEO warned the US and the entire world from his Twitter (@jack) about impending hyperinflation that may alter the look of things globally. In his first tweet that raised the dust on the topic, he stated: “Hyperinflation is going to change everything. It’s happening.” Dorsey’s tweet sparked several reactions from many people who had lots of divergent opinions on the topic as it had over 7k comments, 22.9k retweets and over 70k likes. He later continued on the topic in his second tweet, where he predicted that: “It will happen in the US soon, and so the world.” The CEO’s tweet came as a reaction to the consumer price inflation, nearing a 30-year steady growth in America. However, there are fears that policymakers may not be completely honest with the general public on the issue of inflation. To confirm this, Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve Chairman, avowed that inflation may hang around a little more than expected, possibly until 2022. Other Contributions to Jack Dorsey’s Hyperinflation Warning Tweet While Jack Dorsey may be right in his prediction, some people had different takes on the topic. For example, Patrick Horan, a Monetary Policy Program Manager at George Mason University, declared under Dorsey’s tweet that: “In the United States, Hyperinflation is not happening.” One of Horan’s colleagues, Lawrence White, implied that: “What’s happening is higher inflation, not hyperinflation (except in Venezuela). It’s too bad that Twitter doesn’t allow Jack to edit his tweet.” A professor, Daniel Drezner at Tufts University’s Fletcher School, recounted his experience of hyperinflation when he was in Ukraine. Drezner said in his tweet that: “I lived through actual hyperinflation in Ukraine in the early 1990s. This ain’t it mate.” Dorsey is good at taking criticisms as he humoured Steve Hanke’s response in the comment section. Hanke, an economist and a bitcoin enthusiast, gave his view on the topic. Hanke, in his tweet, stated: “There have been 62 certified hyperinflations in world history. At present, no country is experiencing hyperinflation. Jack should know better than to tweet irresponsible public statements. Hanke’s tweet also got lots of backlashes, and Dorsey, instead of serving back heatedly, replied to Hanke’s post with a “ROTFL” emoji. Hyperinflation and its Economic Effects Hyperinflation occurs when the cost of items increases over fifty per cent monthly for some time, which means that individuals and firms will need more money to buy products due to the price increase. For instance, the cost of feeding will increase from $500 to $800 weekly the next month, and it’ll increase to $1,140 per week, and so on. If people’s earnings don’t tally with the inflation rate, the standard of living will decrease as a result. Hyperinflation will give rise to several problems, including hoarding of goods, food shortage, and bankruptcy. These problems may be what Dorsey is weary of while trying to warn everyone. Many people had divergent views, while a few others heeded his warning by being grateful for the invention of Bitcoin, noting that it will finally become the reserve currency of the world.  ","2021-10-26 03:04:42","","","joplinbusinessjournal"
"Ratna Pathak Shah on marriage with Naseeruddin Shah: ‘Sambhog Se Sanyaas Tak was our first play and that’s the story of our life’","https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/ratna-pathak-shah-on-naseeruddin-shah-hum-do-hamare-do-kriti-sanon-rajkummar-rao-7589786/","['Bollywood', 'Entertainment']","['A. Kameshwari']","","","","2021-10-26 03:04:36","Ratna Pathak Shah defines her upcoming film Hum Do Hamare Do as a “light-hearted look at a family,” which gave her the opportunity to work with Rajkummar Rao, Kriti Sanon and Paresh Rawal. The film marks her first collaboration with Rajkummar and Kriti. She has worked with Paresh Rawal before, but she confessed that he was one of the reasons why she signed the Abhishek Jain directorial. “It is a light-hearted look at a family. What the script wanted to say, I liked it. The cast is a lovely bunch of people who I have not worked with earlier. I have not worked with Rajkummar Rao and Kriti Sanon before. I have worked with Paresh Rawal before but very little. So, it was a definite temptation to work with him. Final (reason) was Abhishek who is a first-time director. I have watched the work that he has done in the Gujarati cinema. Gujarati films were very orthodox but the new lot is looking at the world from a different and fresh perspective,” Ratna told indianexpress.com . ALSO READ | Rajkummar Rao on Hum Do Hamare Do: ‘It is a shift from what I have done before’ Hum Do Hamare Do stars Rajkummar as Dhruv, an orphan who “adopts” parents, played by actors Paresh Rawal and Ratna Pathak Shah, to marry the love (Kriti Sanon) of his life. https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png Talking about her co-stars Rajkummar and Kriti, the 58-year-old said she was amused and impressed. “What I observed is Rajkummar Rao is a very reserved and private person but the way he transforms on-screen and performs the various part he plays with such sensibility and subtlety is impressive. This (Hum Do Humare Do character) could have been over the top too. But the kind of understanding he uses to strike a balance in his characters is something that left me amused. I realised that the kind of understanding he has (of the craft), I didn’t have as a young actor. Today’s generation of actors impresses me as they get into a character with a lot of thought and clarity. They can guide themselves to create a clear path and etch a perfect understanding for the characters they play,” Ratna voiced, adding that with Kriti she was “so pleased to see how balanced she was and had such a clarity about her roles.” View this post on Instagram A post shared by RajKummar Rao (@rajkummar_rao) Ratna said she was happy and proud to see that actresses today are choosing demanding scripts. “In the yesteryears of cinema, heroines were concerned about their hair, makeup and outfit. But today’s actresses, thankfully, have gone beyond it,” Ratna said. She furthered described Kriti as a “warm and open kind of person, which sits very well on cinema. The kind of transparency she imbibes is such great quality and has worked wonders for her in this film.” However, the Lipstick Under My Burkha actor also agrees that the present generation had examples they could follow, which was not the case when she was a “young actor.” “I feel that. I feel as a woman actor, there was a lack of examples to look up to or learn from. I did not want to be Babita or the kind of personality that was meant to sing, dance and look good. I was not interested in being that. So, if not the quintessential retro heroine then what? Those days, there were only limited parts for women. Or you take up the character role path where you end up being boxed. But today, the kind of parts being written for women – young or old – are much more varied and real. They reflect the differences we see in real life, which is very important,” she explained. Citing an example of Bhumi Pednekar’s role in Dum Laga Ke Haisha, Ratna said such roles “were not written in those days”. “Today, it is surely a big advantage, and young actresses are certainly living up to that expectations. Cute banna, khoobsurat banna aur secondary role karna, iske alawa options hi nahi the because of which, we saw the kind of acting that we did. Pick any actor from our era, sab wahi cute, bubbly, cheerful, zor se hasne wali or damsel in distress. There was only these kind of roles to play. And women are not just that. There is nothing women can’t do. We have so much variety to offer, so many different personalities too, which went unnoticed and untapped,” she continued. “Having said that, even men have suffered from these stereotypical representations. If you scored a hit with an angry young man avatar on screen, you were constantly playing the same thing. So, the limitation lay with the directors and the writers. If there were well-written scripts back then, actors would have risen to the occasion. Today, we have better scripts, which is why we can give a quality performance,” Ratna mentioned. Don't Miss These Stories Ratna Pathak Shah on marriage with Naseeruddin Shah: 'Sambhog Se Sanyaas Tak was our first play and that's the story of our life' Friends’ Gunther, actor James Michael Tyler, dies at 59; Anushka Sharma, Jennifer Aniston, Matt LeBlanc pay tributes National Film Awards 2021: Kangana, Manoj, Dhanush receive top honours, Rajinikanth gets Dadasaheb Phalke Award Click here for more When she stated that she didn’t want to become a quintessential heroine, we were keen to know if that motivated her to pick up content that broke stereotypical presentation of certain characters, her role in Hum Do Hamare Do being one of the examples. “I will go back a little and talk about Idhar Udhar (1985), which was my first professional job. I played a young girl, who was quite silly yet sensible in some ways. Now that I look back at it, I find it was a modern concept. Three people living under one roof, not related by sex or blood. Three different kinds of personalities who were living like friends. Can you make such content today? It will be so difficult to write such a story. People would be like ‘Haaye! ladka ladki ek saath ek kamre me reh rahe hai? Aise kaise ho sakta hai.’ Today, we are becoming more backward, regressive in our social attitudes. For example, Tara was based on women living their life without any help from their parents or husbands. It spoke of women creating an existence of their own. So, back then, television was much more progressive and forward-looking. We had series like Udaan or Shanti, there was so much variety!” Ratna said, adding that today’s television content makes her “cry”. Ratna Pathak Shah with cast members of Filmy Chakkar. (Photo: Express Archive) “Today, we are back to saas-bahu dramas. I feel like crying when I watch the kind of content being played on television these days. It is so crude and regressive. Kyun ho raha hai? Ye kya hai? Is this the meaning of sanskriti? So backward!” “Idhar Udhar, Filmy Chakkar allowed me to explore myself as an actor. And whatever I learned back in those days, helped me in Sarabhai vs Sarabhai, Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na or Lipstick Under My Burkha. It did not happen overnight, it happened because of the hard work I did over the years,” she said. Ratna Pathak Shah in a still from her show Sarabhai Vs Sarabhai. (Photo: Express Archive) But even after years of being a part of the industry, Ratna doesn’t think she can be called a sought after actor. “I was not a sought after actor for many years. For several years, I got no work at all. Now also, I get a variety of parts and I pick what is interesting. I am quite astounded that without much suffering, I have had a wonderful career. Also, (over the years) I have become a better actor, undoubtedly. When I started, I was an average actor but I got the chance to better myself and I have grabbed those opportunities with both hands. But I cannot say I have explored myself fully as an actor, and I hope those wishes come true slowly and steadily.” So, what are these roles she wishes to portray? “I like doing contemporary Indian woman. I, unfortunately, have been stuck with urban, upper-class Indian woman format for a longish time. For example, I don’t know what it would feel like to be a homeless woman. Nowadays, we spot a lot of homeless women. Everyone has a story. Either they have been thrown out of the house or they have left their house to achieve their dreams. Some are also young. That is an area, which would be hard to explore. But that is what acting is about – to live a life you didn’t get a chance to live or didn’t want to live. How beautiful it is that you can experience all these lives as an actor without facing the consequences. Or someone who is mentally disturbed or finding it difficult to fit in. I have not explored how women are in the rural space. There is so much to explore. I always feel acting is a way to learn about people. So, I would love to explore.” Coming back to her role in Hum Do Hamare Do, Ratna Pathak Shah plays the love interest of Paresh Rawal. The trailer also features a cute love angle between the two, which made me wonder what was the love story of Ratna and Naseeruddin Shah . “Itna kuch bhi romantic nahi hua tha,” confessed Ratna, adding that they fell in love, got married and have been “inseparable” ever since. A picture of Naseeruddin Shah and Ratna Pathak Shah from one of their theatre plays. (Photo: Express Archive) “We fell in love and have been inseparable ever since. The first theater play we did together was titled Sambhog Se Sanyaas Tak, and that is the story of our life. Bas sanyaas lena baaki hai (laughs). It’s a relationship, which has been very useful. It is a relationship of equals, of friends, which has been a blessing for us. We became very good friends and stayed very good friends,” the actor said. When asked what about Naseeruddin Shah inspires her even today, Ratna said, “Everything. His ability to work hard above all. He is an extraordinarily hard-working actor, which inspires and pushes me to do better. I am very lazy. Itni hardworking nahi hu. Toh Naseer ki dekha dekhi mein, mujhe bhi mehnat karni hi padti hai.” A candid picture of Naseeruddin Shah and Ratna Pathak Shah, (Photo: Express Archive) On a concluding note, Ratna said she is excited about her film releasing on Disney+Hotstar. She finds OTT as a space that has shaken up Hindi cinema. ALSO READ | Naseeruddin Shah as Bollywood’s most blistering polemicist: Hate him, love him, you can’t ignore him “OTT is the reason why we have got the kind of variety in scripts we see today. Entertainment has become a part of our house. It is sure a blessing. And to top it all, we can watch world cinema, which has changed our choices in the content we consume. OTT has broken and shaken up Hindi cinema and its stereotypical representation. Young writers and directors are getting a chance to represent their point of view, their stories, and represent the India that I see every day around me. It is a silver lining for actors for sure,” she said. Hum Do Hamare Do will release on Disney+Hotstar on October 29.","","indianexpress"
"Morrison delivered the pledge voters wanted but not the plan they needed","https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/morrison-delivered-the-pledge-voters-wanted-but-not-the-plan-they-needed-20211026-p59397.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_politics","","['David Crowe']","","There was no new measure on Tuesday to explain what would take Australia from its old target to the new one. Old policies were dressed up to look like climate action.","","2021-10-26 03:04:23","One key chart in Scott Morrison’s new climate policy shows the Prime Minister is wishing and hoping Australia can get to net zero rather than making absolutely sure it does. The new statement reveals that half the work of reaching the net zero deadline in 2050 will come from things nobody can be sure about – such as an assumption about global trends outside anyone’s control. Scott Morrison is wishing and hoping Australia can get to net zero rather than making absolutely sure it does. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen That means a lot of the policy is about what the government wants to happen, not so much what it will make happen. To be precise, 15 per cent of the work in reducing emissions comes from “global technology trends” and another 15 per cent from “further technology breakthroughs” as well as up to 20 per cent from trading in carbon offsets. About 20 per cent of the cut to emissions from 2005 to 2050 is already banked. This reduction has been mostly achieved through changes to land clearing – a contentious claim for the environmental movement but within the rules under United Nations protocols. Another 40 per cent is meant to come from the government’s technology investment road map, a $20 billion spending scheme that was announced last year – and another big bet on promising but unproven ideas such as hydrogen. All of this was known for months, if not years, when Morrison prevaricated over net zero and Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce argued the target would wreck the economy. What changed? There was no new measure on Tuesday to explain what would take Australia from its old target to the new one. The commitment to net zero involved agonising political debate within the Nationals and some resistance within the Liberals. But asked about the total cost of the package, Morrison listed policies that have been in the budget papers for months or years. The $550 million manufacturing scheme, for instance, and the $6.4 billion outlay on skills and training. The $3.5 billion for the national water grid and the $5 billion future drought fund were also listed in the brochure to sell the net zero goal. So old policies were dressed up to look like climate action. The Nationals and Liberals are clearly nervous about a target that some of their supporters do not like. Joyce has looked glum in Parliament all week, making it obvious he is being dragged to an outcome he has resisted for years. Morrison has looked buoyant, however, because he has achieved a policy that will work for the Liberals in the marginal seats they want to win. What is missing, however, is the element Morrison has talked about so much for so long: the “how” of reducing emissions. What, exactly, will drive them down? The government has made the right commitment. Australians broadly support the net zero target and want a policy to get them there. Morrison delivered the pledge they wanted. But he did it without the plan they needed. Fascinating answers to perplexing questions delivered to your inbox every week. Sign up to get our new Explainer newsletter here .","","smh"

That approval could come as soon as this week. The FDA advisory panel is set to meet Tuesday to decide whether to recommend the Pfizer vaccine for 5 to 11-year-olds. “I think it would be great to have kids in the above five age range able to get vaccinated before the holidays before we all get together with our loved ones. I think that will really help decrease the risk of spreading COVID during the holidays,” said Dr. Sarah d’Hulst, a pediatrician for MultiCare.

It is very difficult for them to remain physically distant from each other,” she said.

LEADERSHIP recalls that there was no provision for fuel subsidy in the 2021 budget, yet the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) said it has spent no less than N714.79 billion on fuel subsidy, which it calls under-recovery of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) in its monthly report. The NNPC had since February 2021 been making direct deductions from the Federation Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC) funds to offset petrol subsidy. Associate professor, Department of Private and Commercial Law, Babcock University, Dr Temitayo Bello, said that not making provision for fuel subsidy in the budget is symbolic. The government is subtly telling Nigerians that from next year they are going to pay the market value for petrol, so they should prepare. Dr Bello, who spoke with LEADERSHIP by telephone, said that in any case, the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) had already expunged payment of subsidy. He described the issue of fuel subsidy as political and not one that makes economic sense. “You don’t ask a dying person to donate blood,” he said, adding that the payment of fuel subsidy was killing the economy and, therefore, cannot be sustained. He noted that removing subsidy would not double the current prices of goods and services, adding that most of the payment is used to subsidize neighbouring countries’ fuel consumption. According to him, Nigeria’s fuel consumption cannot be more than 30 to 35 million litres per day. However, the consumption figure of over 100 million per day has been reported in some months. LEADERSHIP reports that fuel subsidy has constituted a major drain on government revenues as the sum of N10.413 trillion had been spent on the subsidy regime in the last 14 years. While there was no subsidy spent in January, NNPC spent N25.37 billion in February, a figure that rose by more than 100 per cent in March to N60.396 billion. The corporation then spent N61.966 billion in April which more than doubled to N126.298 billion in May, following reported hike in the landing cost of imported petrol. The national oil company further incurred a higher cost in petrol subsidy of N164.337 billion in June but it declined to N103.286 billion by July. However, by August, the gain was reversed when subsidy cost rose to N173.132 billion, the highest figure published so far. Analysts had expected to see fuel subsidy provided for in the 2022 budget to put an end to the extra-budgetary spendings the corporation had been engaging in, especially since the federal government said fuel subsidy would remain despite the signing of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA). The group managing director of the NNPC, Mele Kyari, said earlier in September that the federal government was projecting N900 billion for fuel subsidy for 2022 as he said subsidy would remain until the unresolved issues between the federal government and the organised labour on the implementation of the full deregulation of the downstream sector of the oil industry were ironed out. The government had in March 2020 announced an end to fuel subsidy regime and the immediate deregulation of the downstream sector of the petroleum industry amid a global oil price crash. The process was later suspended earlier this year to allow for consultation with stakeholders and organised labour. Petroleum Subsidy Removal Will Galvanize Economy, Drive Investment – Economists, Marketers Key petroleum marketers in Nigeria have said that Nigerians would begin to witness economic growth across key sectors of the economy with the planned removal of subsidy payment for petrol. They argue that the subsidy regime had left the national economy bleeding as scarce foreign exchange is frittered away through fraudulent subsidy regime. National president of the Petroleum Outlets Owners Association of Nigeria (PETROAN), Prince Billy Harry, in his reaction said the subsidy payment had significantly under-developed the country. Harry said the removal will spur investment in the sector as huge expenditure on the subsidy payment will be deployed to develop other industries and entrench transparency in the system. “Why do we encourage a system that benefits only a few. Go to rural communities and petrol which government is spending so much to subsidise is sold much higher than what is sells in urban areas. If we remove subsidy, it will galvanise the economy, create opportunities that will bring about growth, generate employment and support infrastructure development across critical sectors of the economy,” he said. On his part, the national president of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria, IPMAN, Chinedu Okoronkwo, said the marketers are eagerly awaiting such opportunities to make investments. “We are just asking government to provide a level playing field so that players in the sector will consider making investment with those opportunities capable of advancing our economy,” said Okoronkwo. According to him, investors are holding back their money because the regulated regime is not attractive. He allayed fear of possible skyrocketing of pump price. “When government frees the market, marketers will begin to import and the country will witness sustained products importation and distribution,” he said. Okoronkwo, however, expressed reservation as to whether the PIA implementation committee would recommend the immediate removal of subsidy at this point. “I will advise we wait for the committee’s recommendation in the first place,” the IPMAN president added. In his submission Goke Dele, chief executive officer, Quest Oil & Engineering Services Limited, stated that the removal of petroleum subsidy will mark a turnaround for the downstream oil and gas sector. Dele said that apart from enhancing investment, it will provide an enabling environment for the market forces to determine prices. “On the possible impact of this on the final consumer, contrary to the fear of many people, this development will increase competition, and this means that consumers can buy from where the prices are cheaper. “We must give government kudos for having the will to do the right thing. However, they now need to provide the enabling infrastructure that will accelerate gas usage to cushion the effect of the deregulation.”","","leadership"
"Questions raised over tribunal workloads","https://www.newcastleherald.com.au/story/7484849/questions-raised-over-tribunal-workloads/?src=rss","","['Dominic Giannini']","","","","2021-10-26 01:53:43","The Administrative Appeals Tribunal has been lambasted by senators for paying coalition-appointed members hundreds of thousands of dollars despite failing benchmarks. Conflicts of interests that were easily discovered online or known by the attorney-general and department but not passed on to the AAT were also heavily criticised. Former chief of staff to Liberal senator George Brandis, James Lambie, was paid $329,000 in 2020/21, reaching only 45 per cent of his benchmarks, which was down from 65 per cent the year before. Former LNP member of the Queensland parliament, Ian Berry, was paid $221,000 in 2020/21 , achieving 43 per cent of benchmarks. Former Liberal party member for the West Australian parliament, Joe Francis, took home $255,000, hitting 65 per cent of his benchmarks. Mr Francis finalised four cases in four months in 2018/19. The average number of cases finalised by members in that year was 15 per month. Former Liberal parliamentarian Russell Matheson was paid more than $250,000 in the last financial year, hitting just over half of his benchmarks. At least two other members were paid tens of thousands of dollars despite not finalising any cases over a four-month period. AAT registrar Sian Leathem defended the performance in Senate estimates on Tuesday, saying the benchmarks did not show the whole picture as some cases were more complex than others. Some members also co-sat on other cases due to their expertise, while other members started only months out from the end of financial years and therefore cases would have been finalised in the next reporting period, Ms Leathem said. Two appointees by former attorney-general Christian Porter, who were then rubber stamped by cabinet, were listed as lobbyists, raising potential conflicts of interest. Members are required to declare any potential conflict of interests. Barton Deakin lobbyist John Griffin, who served as John Howard's senior private secretary and chief of staff to former Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett, ""continues to assist the Liberal and National parties on state and federal election campaigns"" according to the company's website. Mr Griffin declared he was listed on the lobbyist register prior to him starting the role and this was passed on to Mr Porter and the attorney-general's department. The AAT was not made aware of his listing until a media enquiry was made on October 11 this year, almost two years after his appointment. A department official said information would not have been passed onto the tribunal due to privacy issues. The AAT will now require members to provide an annual disclosure of potential conflicts of interest.

"Significant Rain Event Brewing Later This Week - Next Week Will Feel Like November","https://www.startribune.com/significant-rain-event-brewing-later-this-week-next-week-will-feel-like-november/600109968/","","['Paul Douglas']","","","","2021-10-26 01:44:58","Soaking Rain Likely By Wednesday With Canada cooling off rapidly, late October can bring jaw-dropping storms. California went from extreme drought to Biblical flooding in the meteorological blink of an eye: reports of mudslides, flooding, and 5-10 feet of snow in the mountains. Meanwhile a powerful Nor'easter may bring hurricane-force gusts to southern New England later today. I'm counting my blessings, atmospheric and otherwise. We salvage a breezy, blue-sky Tuesday with highs in the 50s. No small feat, considering today's sun angle is the same as it was back on February 16, when the metro woke up to -15F. That still stings. Then again, October weather has been typical of September: 7F warmer than average at MSP with 13 days above 70F and only one night below freezing. Will we make up for that in February 2022? No idea, but nothing surprises me anymore. A soaking rain is likely Wednesday- Thursday with 1-2 inch amounts. Saturday looks nice with highs near 60F, but a cooler, vaguely horrifying breeze may blow on Sunday. Scary... Fine Tuesday - Rain Arrives Wednesday . The soggy remains of the storm that battered the west coast will weaken as they cross the Rockies, but hold together long enough for an extended rain event (yep, all rain this time around) Wednesday into Thursday with potentially significant, 1-inch-plus rainfall amounts by Friday morning. Back To The 50s . Expect 50s this week, even with the rain Wednesday and Thursday, with a slight chance of sampling 60 degrees Saturday afternoon. Temperatures will trend cooler next week with a run of 40s likely. Mild(er) Signal Reemerges by Mid-November . We'll see a few hardier shots of Canadian air the first week of November, but GFS model guidance suggests a return of ridging over the northern Rockies and southern Canada in roughly 2 weeks, as a classic omega-block pattern proves resilient, with a tendency toward stormy weather for the east and west coast. October Snowfall . Rapid City gets the Golden Snow Shovel Award with over 5"" of snow; the only Minnesota reporting station seeing flurries so far this month is Duluth. ""Atmospheric River"" Swings Northern California from Drought to Flood . Like flipping on a light switch, according to a post at Axios.com : "" A series of powerful ""atmospheric river"" storms are delivering historic amounts of rainfall across parts of drought-stricken California and the Pacific Northwest. The atmospheric river, packing large amounts of moisture, was causing Northern California to whiplash from drought to flood, as it slowly moved south overnight. It's triggered widespread power outages, flooding and mudslides. The storm system claimed the lives of two people in Washington state after a tree fell on a vehicle amid powerful winds Sunday. The storm is associated with a record-strong ""bomb cyclone"" off the Pacific Northwest, which was forecast to remain at sea. But it's bringing wind gusts of up to 60-70 mph and greater than 40-foot waves off the coasts of northern California, Oregon, Washington and British Columbia ..."" Official NOAA Forecast Includes Possible Impacts of Brewing La Nina . CNN.com has an overview; here's a clip: ""... A wetter-than-normal season is forecast for portions of the Midwest, Ohio Valley and New England, as well, NOAA said. La Niña could impact the drought ""significantly,"" NOAA said. ""There tends to be below-normal precipitation along the southern tier of the US, and with that being the expectation for what we are favoring in the outlook, we do expect the drought to persist along many places in the Southwest,"" Gottschalck said. Even with a stronger monsoon season in the Southwest, that wasn't enough to quell the drought. But remember: This is a seasonal outlook — not the day-to-day forecast. There will be extreme variability in the day-to-day forecast, including extremely cold days in the South, as well as drier weeks in the North. .."" If Clouds Are Made of Water, How Do They Stay in the Air? WIRED.com (paywall) has a wonky post filled with wonderful math that explains what's really happening; here is a clip: ""... So, imagine a wind blowing a tiny drop of water upward at a speed of 1.5 m/s. The upward-pushing air resistance can have the same magnitude as the downward gravitational force. The drop will have zero velocity and zero net force. It will just stay there. So this is what is happening with the clouds: The water droplets are small enough that the upward-pushing force of the air can keep them suspended aloft. But it can't keep them at the same altitude forever. Any droplet with a large enough radius will eventually get overwhelmed by the downward pull of gravity. Basic physics shows that clouds don't have to float—they fall, but they fall really slowly ..."" A Few Idealistic Canadians Are Trying to Replant the World's Forests with Flying Machines . A clever use of drone technology, as outlined at The Washington Post (paywall): ""... While many think of drones as a toy or, worse, a lethally precise military tool, Flash Forest has gone the other way: It's deploying drones to nourish life. The 20-person Toronto company is using a fleet of unmanned vehicles to plant (more accurately, carpet-bomb) the landscape with tree seeds and replenish those majestic carbon guzzlers. The battle against climate change can be waged with sober policymaking, an engaged citizenry and corporate responsibility. It can also be fought, it turns out, by a few hipster millennials with flying machines. ""Drones have been featured in science fiction for so long, I understand why people don't always think of them in terms of solving our problems,"" Jones said. ""But they're an incredibly practical tool to do things we could never do otherwise. .."" Inside Clean Energy: Electric Vehicles Are Having a Banner Year . Here Are the Numbers. Inside Climate News reports: "" Electric vehicle sales have made a leap this year in the United States. From January to September, U.S. consumers bought 305,324 all-electric vehicles, an increase of 83 percent from the same period in 2020, according to Kelley Blue Book . With this bump in sales, all-electric vehicles are now 2.6 percent of all new light duty cars and trucks sold in the country, up from 1.6 percent at this time last year. Those are huge gains. But when I spoke with auto analysts this week, they said 2021 is only an appetizer for what is coming in 2022. The increase in sales this year came despite major challenges, including a short-term shortage of computer chips that has led to production delays, and long-term regional differences that mean the EV market barely exists in much of the country. .."" The Coming Electric Car Disruption That Nobody's Talking About . The only predictable thing is change, as highlighted in a post at Yahoo! News ; here's an excerpt that caught my eye: ""... Making the massive batteries that line the bottom of electric cars promises to employ thousands. But where a conventional car's engine and transmission have hundreds of parts, some electric-vehicle powertrains have as few as 17, according to the Congressional Research Service. That doesn't take into account the radiators, fuel tanks or exhaust systems that electric vehicles don't need. Once operating, an electric car has no spark plugs or oil that need changing or mufflers that wear out. And with so few moving parts, service stations could be relegated to changing tires and windshield wipers. Conventional cars will probably remain on the road for years, softening the blow for repair shops and other affiliated industries. But with an average lifespan of 12 years, the trend lines for gasoline-powered vehicles will be heading down ..."" How Working from Home Could Change Where Innovation Happens . A post at Wall Street Journal (paywall) caught my eye: ""... Some researchers and industry experts see the trend as a sign of profound change, at least in the tech industry, which traditionally has been one of the most geographically concentrated fields. Many people are moving outside of the usual industry hubs, and they aren't coming back. This shift has profound implications for where and how innovation will happen. Tech-company engineers and other professionals moving farther from the office could bring tech expertise to places that have long sought to add it. And big companies in coastal hubs now have the ability to tap into talent pools farther afield ..."" ""My Poor Ass"": Michelangelo Wrote a Poem About How Much He Hated Painting the Sistine Chapel. I had no idea, but a post at Mental Floss has the details: ""... Michelangelo had come into renown as a sculptor and considered painting the 12,000 square feet of the ceiling beyond his capabilities. He was wrong, of course, but the artistic anxiety caused him considerable distress. He even made sure the first portion of the ceiling, The Flood, was tucked away and largely out of sight in case he messed it up. He famously worked 65 feet in the air on custom scaffolding, and after four years of effort from 1508 to 1512, the physical toil of craning his neck upward was apparent.

That's the conclusion of a landmark report from the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the federal entity established after the Great Recession to guard against future economic disasters. It marks the first time the council has deemed climate change an ""emerging threat"" to the US economy since the council was created as part of the Dodd-Frank financial reforms of 2010.

The producer on the film Freedom’s Path, who asked to remain anonymous, said that during production in 2019 “a crew member incurred a minor and temporary injury when a gun was unexpectedly discharged.” After the prop gun incident, Rust assistant director Dave Halls “was removed from set,” after which production continued. “Our condolences go out to everyone affected by the recent tragic event in New Mexico,” the Freedom’s Path producer said in the statement. CNN was the first to report the statement. THR has reached out to Halls for comment. According to search warrants from the Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office, prior to the Oct. 21 on-set shooting that killed Rust ‘s cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins , and injured director Joel Souza , Halls took one of three prop guns provided by production armorer Hannah Gutierrez Reed and then handed Baldwin the weapon, yelling “cold gun,” indicating there were no live rounds inside. Halls was not aware there were live rounds loaded in the gun, the warrant says. In the warrants, director Souza provides a statement that says the incident took place while Baldwin was practicing for a scene inside of a church in which his character cross-draws a gun. “Joel [Souza] stated they had Alec sitting in a pew in a church building setting, and he was practicing a cross draw. Joel said he was looking over the shoulder of [Halyna], when he heard what sounded like a whip and then loud pop,” according to the warrant. Camera operator Reid Russell said in a statement in the warrants that during a set-up for a rehearsal, Baldwin was explaining to Souza and Hutchins how he would draw out the weapon. Russell said he “was not sure why the firearm was discharged and just remembered the loud bang.” Rust has wrapped production until the law-enforcement investigation is complete. Producers said in a letter obtained by THR and sent to crew on Sunday that the wrap was a “pause rather than an end.” Hutchins was remembered in a candlight vigil hosted by International Cinematographers Guild 600 at the IATSE Local 80 headquarters on Sunday night. “We all stand together at this moment in grief and disbelief, and what we do with that will define us and define this moment,” Local 600 national executive director Rebecca Rhine said during the program.","","hollywoodreporter"

The post FIFA 22 Update 2 patch notes: AI block nerfs, new Career Mode scenes, gameplay fixes appeared first on Dexerto.","EA SPORTS has released a new FIFA 22 patch on all consoles and Origin’s PC version — Update #2 — that fixes some of the game’s worst bugs. Here’s the full list of changes. Title Update #2 was announced on October 19 and went live in FIFA 22 on PC shortly after. Now it’s going live on PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch too, bringing a laundry list of tweaks and fixes to FUT, Career Mode, and general gameplay to the console versions of the 2021 title. Some of the changes tuned the in-game AI a bit and fixed some of the more blatant bugs we’ve seen since launch. We’re also getting a bit more content in Career Mode, so let’s take a look at all there is. FIFA 22 AI nerfed & disappearing players glitch fixed EA SPORTSPlayers disappearing from matches should hopefully be a thing of the past. The effectiveness of AI-controlled players blocking Lobbed Passes and crosses has been reduced. Devs said this was due to some FIFA 22 AI players being able to stretch too far to break them up. Second, AI-controlled teams will now be more likely to commit fouls during matches played on Semi-Pro and above. However, this doesn’t apply to matches played when Competitor Mode is on. The update also addressed some of the outrageous bugs we’ve been seeing since launch. Instances like the ball getting launched into space when two players make contact or referees calling a free-kick on a foul inside of the penalty box have been addressed. Read More: FIFA 22 Record Breaker cards: Confirmed players, SBC & Objectives But the craziest glitch being fixed has to be the one that would literally have players disappear off the pitch during a game. It could even happen to your keeper, leaving your net completely open as you can see in the clip below. How is anything like this acceptable in a game that comes out using the same engine, with minor changes, every single year? I'd love if EA had some proper competition or took 2 years to build a game with some soul in it.

FIFA Ultimate Team Made the following changes: Penalty Shootout kick order will now be decided by the Penalties Attribute. When players share the same Penalties Attribute, the Shot Power and Finishing Attributes will be used to determine the order.

"There’s no denying Alec Baldwin’s role in on-set shooting tragedy","https://nypost.com/2021/10/25/no-denying-alec-baldwins-role-in-shooting-mishap-tragedy/","","['Maureen Callahan']","","The death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins has also been painted as Alec Baldwin’s tragedy. ","The death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins has also been painted as Alec Baldwin’s tragedy. ","2021-10-26 01:44:04","The death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins has also been painted as Alec Baldwin’s tragedy. Really, it’s not. In fact, Alec Baldwin is likely to be held, at least in part, responsible. “If you’re capable of memorizing 120 pages of dialogue, you can memorize four lines of gun safety,” special-effects and firearms expert Steve Wolf tells The Post. “If that scene required him to put the gun to his head and pull the trigger, I’m sure he would have taken a look inside the gun. Wouldn’t you?” As a producer on “Rust,” Baldwin could be held culpable for the cost-cutting, chaos and eventual hire of a young head armorer with just one stint in said job on her résumé — because, according to Deadline, multiple other armorers turned it down over low pay and high stakes, with too many firearms to manage. “They hired someone who was insufficiently experienced,” Wolf says. “If he’s the producer, the buck stops with him.” And as a veteran actor who has starred in multiple films involving firearms — “The Departed” and two installments of “Mission: Impossible” come to mind — you would think Baldwin would be extra cautious wielding a gun on set. “Don’t point guns at people,” is the most elemental rule on sets, Wolf says. “Don’t point guns at anything you don’t want to put a hole in.” Retired FBI Agent Bobby Chacon, who works as a writer and consultant in Hollywood, agrees. If fact, Chacon goes over the four basic rules of guns on sets so often that his actors roll their eyes. He takes this as a sign to keep going, because they’ve heard it all before, they know the rules, and still they listen: It’s often the bean counters, Chacon tells The Post, who prefer saving money over safety. On one major network cop show, the line producer — the person responsible for the budget — “would nickel-and-dime me to no end,” Chacon says. “They were very penny-wise and pound-foolish. Sometimes [they] would try to save my paltry daily fee on days when [actors] were just going have their guns out as opposed to using them.” Chacon says he was paid $500 a day for this show that cost, “no kidding, $1,041 per minute to shoot.” Each episode was an eight-day production, so if an actor, writer or director had a question for Chacon and he wasn’t there, the 10-minute delay to get Chacon on the phone cost 20 times his day rate. And Chacon had an experience not unlike what happened on “Rust.” “I dug my heels in [about being there] on a particular day because the script called for our team to have their guns out and make an arrest,” Chacon recalls “The line producer literally said something like, ‘We’ll be fine. Our first AD [assistant director] has done a ton of cop shows, so he can show them how to do the arrest.’ I walked away at that point.” On the day Hutchins was fatally shot on the Santa Fe, NM, set of “Rust,” assistant director David Halls, not the head armorer, handed Baldwin the firearm and yelled, “Cold gun!” — meaning the gun was supposed to be empty, no blanks, nothing. As for how live ammunition found its way on set, Wolf is speechless. “It’s against all movie-making protocols,” he says. This tragedy is not just down to cost-cutting measures or crew fatigue. Wolf says movie sets can be so intimidating, staffed with young crew members who are star-struck or cowed by a demanding director or just thrilled to be working in the industry, that most would never speak up. “Rust” was a hasty 21-day shoot. Multiple reports say the crew felt dangerous compromises were being made. “An old wiseass like me would say, ‘I’m not going to compromise safety,’ ” Wolf says, “but most people won’t say that because of fear they’ll be fired.” Yet on “Rust,” we know seven crew members walked off set the morning Hutchins was killed — and they walked over safety concerns. During production, someone rang the alarm to the unit production manager, texting, “We’ve now had 3 accidental discharges. This is super unsafe.” Wolf tells The Post that the Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office has reached out to him about helping its investigation. “Everything I find will probably point to negligence,” Wolf says. “Gross negligence, possibly criminal negligence. The armorer didn’t have the experience to command a set. You have a gun, a bullet, someone aiming it, and someone firing it. So it was inevitable if you bring together those ingredients.” The question isn’t how this could have happened to Halyna Hutchins. The question really is: How could it not?","https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/alec-baldwin-responsible-316-1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all","nypost"
"Hunt for restaurateur, charged with bid to import cocaine, after alleged bail breach","https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/hunt-for-restaurateur-charged-with-bid-to-import-cocaine-after-alleged-bail-breach-20211026-p59340.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_feed","","['Fergus Hunter']","","Mostafa Baluch, the alleged financier of a major cocaine importation syndicate, is being hunted by police after allegedly disabling his ankle monitor while on bail.","","2021-10-26 01:44:01","The alleged financier of a major cocaine importation syndicate is being hunted by police after allegedly disabling his ankle monitor while on bail. Mostafa Baluch, a wealthy 33-year-old restaurateur from Bayview on Sydney’s northern beaches, was charged in June over his alleged role in an attempt to import 900 kilograms of cocaine from Ecuador. Mostafa Baluch, charged over his alleged role in a drug importation syndicate, is wanted for allegedly breaching bail. It was one attempted shipment in a larger conspiracy that sought to import a total of three tonnes into Australia, police allege. The conspiracy came to the attention of organised crime detectives after one man allegedly involved, Mende Trajkoski, gambled $166 million through Sydney’s Star casino since 2007, despite working as a part-time courier . Mr Baluch, the former owner of Cervo in Northbridge on Sydney’s lower north shore and whose family owns the Lucky & Pep’s restaurants on the northern beaches, was arrested in June and charged with a series of offences, including conspiracy to import a commercial quantity of a border-controlled drug. He is also charged with three counts of importing commercial quantities of border controlled drugs for allegedly importing smaller cocaine amounts through air cargo. Mostafa Baluch was granted bail last week. Police inquiries into Mr Baluch were linked to Operation Ironside, in which police secretly controlled and monitored communications on An0m , a platform that was popular in the underworld. He is accused of being the sole financier of the attempt to import the 900 kilograms of cocaine, which had a potential street value of $270 million. The shipment – like a previous one linked to the syndicate – was intercepted by US authorities off the coast of South America. He was granted bail, subject to strict conditions, at Sydney Central Local Court on Thursday. In his successful application, $4 million in the form of equity in a property was provided as security to be forfeited if the conditions were breached. He was also required to wear an ankle monitor and report daily to Mona Vale police station. Police had opposed bail, arguing Mr Baluch had access to large amounts of cash and had recently expressed a desire to travel overseas. On Tuesday, police issued an appeal for public assistance to locate Mr Baluch, saying he was wanted for a breach of bail. Mr Baluch had been listed to appear in the Supreme Court on Tuesday as the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions applied for an order to have him detained again. Barrister Adrian Williams, representing prosecutors, told the court Mr Baluch “appears to have absconded overnight”. “He is presently being pursued,” Mr Williams said. The detention order was withdrawn, given the development, with the expectation he would be taken into custody anyway and refused bail following the alleged bail breach, if he is apprehended. Mr Baluch is described as being of Mediterranean or Middle Eastern appearance, 180 centimetres tall, muscular, with black hair and brown eyes. Police say he was last seen on Pittwater Road in Bayview about 10.40pm on Monday and may still be on the northern beaches. Asked about the matter on Tuesday, NSW Police Minister David Elliott said Mr Baluch had allegedly removed his ankle monitor. “Now that says to me that he doesn’t deserve the confidence that the court has afforded him,” Mr Elliott said. “I am pretty confident that, knowing the technology and surveillance techniques of the NSW Police, he’ll be found.” Police urged members of the public to call triple zero if they see, or have information about, Mr Baluch.

"Carli Lloyd might be 'Iced-out Carli,' but she feels the warmth heading into her finale","https://www.startribune.com/carli-lloyd-might-be-iced-out-carli-but-she-feels-the-warmth-heading-into-her-finale/600109969/","","['Jerry Zgoda']","","Carli Lloyd will play her 316th and final game for the U.S. Women's National Team plays South Korea on Tuesday at Allianz Field.","","2021-10-26 01:35:40","Soccer star Carli Lloyd says she has tried to play every game in her 17-year U.S. Women's National Team career like it is her last. So what will she do Tuesday night at Allianz Field when a friendly match against South Korea really is her last for her country? ""I'm going to let the emotions flow the way they're going to flow,"" she said. That's something of a revelation from a 39-year-old woman always driven, sometimes distant all these years, who refers to herself occasionally as ""Iced-out Carli"" because others have done so. She has played for her country in three different decades, in four FIFA Women's World Cups and four Olympic Games. She won each twice and was a two-time FIFA Player of the Year. Her 315 USWNT games played are second-most in world soccer history and her 134 international goals are third-most in U.S. women's history and fourth all-time. Her coach, Vlatko Andonovski, deems it a career that would have gotten statues erected and streets named if she were a man playing in Europe. He calls ""iconic"" her best performances that included a hat trick – one goal scored from midfield – in the first 17 minutes of the 2015 World Cup final victory over Japan. Seventeen players in U.S. women's national-team history have played at least 179 games. Lloyd has played that many since she turned 30. She has two more games scheduled this week, and possibly playoffs with her NWSL Gotham FC team. ""She extended the lifespan for professional athletes and showed age is just a number,"" he said. On Tuesday, Lloyd will say goodbye to it all on the final night of four-game, post-Tokyo Olympics tour started last month when Lloyd scored five goals in a 9-0 victory over Paraguay. Lloyd is doing so physically exhausted from many years and many sacrifices made to reach such a high standard she calls ""so incredibly hard."" A collegiate star at Rutgers, she played her first USWNT game in July 2005, six days before her 23rd birthday. ""It's very tiring to continue to prove people wrong,"" she said. Lloyd is also emotionally worn from this short tour, now that she has allowed herself to really see everything whirling around her. She promises that Tuesday's game will be a night for fans – and maybe even teammates and coaches past and present – to get a look behind the curtain. ""I've been `Iced-Out Carli' for so long and people have seen that,"" she said Monday in a video call with reporters. ""People haven't seen a different side of me, but I'm going to savor it. I'm going to savor every moment, and it's going to be truly special for one last time to give it all I have for this team, for the crest, for the country, for the fans. ""No tunnel vision tomorrow night. I'm going to soak in every last possible minute and enjoy it."" Iced-Out Carli might have never attended Sunday's Rolling Stones concert at U.S. Bank Stadium two nights before a game, even a friendly. She and teammates Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan went together and met Mick Jagger backstage. ""Throughout my career, I've just wanted to be the best soccer player I could be. I often missed out on doing things for fun,"" Lloyd said. ""I'm not missing out on anything anymore. I was really happy I decided to go see the Rolling Stones. I know it wasn't really my era, but an unbelievable bucket-list to cross off."" Jagger is 78 and not near retirement. Lloyd is 39 and still scoring goals in a bunch in a friendly. ""They sort of make me feel like I should keep playing,"" she said. Instead, she passed along her No. 10 jersey with a new name on it to teammate Lindsey Horan before a game last week in Kansas City. ""It's insane. I hope she doesn't retire,"" Horan said optimistically. ""I think we can pull her back in."" Tuesday will be the last time Lloyd wears the number usually given to a playmaking midfielder. ""I'm going to try my best not to cry again because I've cried about seven times today,"" Horan said that day. ""It's probably one of the most special moments of my career. … Giving me the opportunity to wear her jersey, I'm going to try to represent it the best way I possibly can. I'll think of her every time I put it on."" Nearly 30 family members and friends from the Philadelphia/New Jersey area from where she comes will celebrate and console. Her parents, husband Brian Hollins, sister, young nieces, in-laws and others are traveling from afar. ""It feels like everything has come back full circle,"" Lloyd said. ""I know it's going to be hard to hold back the tears. But I'm going to embrace it: the fans, see the posters, see the jerseys, just be in the moment. ""I've had the best of both worlds. ""I'm sure there were times maybe my focus was too intense, but I gave it all I had and that's what is really special, walking away from this knowing I gave it everything I had.""","","startribune"

Menschenrechtler fordern seine sofortige Freilassung.","2021-10-26 01:33:00","Vor einer Anhörung im Fall Julian Assange hat amnesty international (ai) erneut die Freilassung des inhaftierten Wikileaks-Gründers gefordert. Die US-Justiz müsse ihre Vorwürfe gegen den Australier fallenlassen und die britischen Behörden ihn umgehend aus der Haft entlassen, teilte die Menschenrechtsorganisation am Dienstag mit. Am Mittwoch soll in London das Berufungsverfahren um Assanges Auslieferung an die USA beginnen. Die US-Justiz will Assange wegen Spionagevorwürfen den Prozess machen. Ihm drohen in den USA bis zu 175 Jahre Haft. Eine Richterin in London hat das Auslieferungsbegehren im Januar mit Hinblick auf Assanges angegriffene psychische Gesundheit und die zu erwartenden Haftbedingungen in den USA abgelehnt. Seither durfte Julian Assange nicht an die USA ausgeliefert werden , blieb aber in britische Haft. Amnesty verwies auf Berichte, die nahelegen, dass die USA geplant haben sollen, Assange zu entführen oder zu ermorden , als er sich in der ecuadorianischen Botschaft in London aufhielt: ""Damit werden die diplomatischen Zusicherungen der US-Behörden, wonach Assange in den USA eine gute Behandlung erwartet, noch weniger glaubhaft"". Noch immer sei niemand für US-Kriegsverbrechen in Afghanistan oder dem Irak zur Verantwortung gezogen worden, sagte Amnesty-Generalsekretärin Agnès Callamard. Doch demjenigen, der diese Verbrechen aufgedeckt habe, drohe ein Leben hinter Gittern. Kriegsverbrechen aufgedeckt Vorgeworfen wird Assange, mit der Whistleblowerin Chelsea Manning geheimes Material von US-Militäreinsätzen im Irak und in Afghanistan gestohlen und veröffentlicht zu haben. Er habe damit US-Informanten in Gefahr gebracht. Seine Unterstützer sehen in ihm einen investigativen Journalisten, der Kriegsverbrechen ans Licht gebracht hat.

"Children's book, soccer pitch aim to help military kids","https://www.wcpo.com/news/our-community/homefront/childrens-book-soccer-pitch-aim-to-help-military-kids-struggling-with-mental-health","","","","“It's proven that there's a mental health crisis among military children, even more so than just our general population because of the stressors they go through,” said Amy Schweizer.","Military deployments have many sides to them when it comes to the emotional toll, particularly for married couples with children. The separation and absence of a parent or parents is shown to have a direct impact on the mental health and well-being of children. “It's proven that there's a mental health crisis among military children, even more so than just our general population because of the stressors they go through,” said Amy Schweizer.She is married to an active-duty U.S. Marine and has three children. She’s dealt with deployments and the anguish trying to comfort her kids knowing her husband will be gone for long periods of time.“They are going through the same things that we do as adults, so we're worried about their safety, we're stressed because we're doing everything by ourselves. There's kind of all these unknowns, and so they feel that as well just without the tools to handle it,” Schweizer said.That’s why she decided to write a children's book to help military kids understand what they’re feeling and to give them guidance to help them manage.“Putting into terms or they hear it, they're like, okay, like they can recognize I felt that way too,” she said.The book entitled ‘I Will Be Okay – Adventures of a Military Kid’ was a pandemic project and she self-published on Amazon.“I really love for everyone to share it as a tool,” she said.The book takes the main character, Roman, through levels of separation, anxiety, and the feeling of loneliness when, due to distance, his grandmother can’t pay a visit. The character is then introduced to soccer to interact with more kids and get his mind off of his father being gone for so long.“So, it's good for them to be exposed to those peer situations so that they form a sense of community, even though of course, they don't realize that as a child,” Schweizer said. “That's what we're fostering as parents is to give them support and, in this situation, just by having fun and playing soccer.She adds that being active also directly helps with the child’s mental health and overall well-being. In addition, meeting other kids who are going through the same thing puts life events into more perspective.Aside from the new children’s book Amy Schweizer also runs Tiny Troops Soccer.“We have (it) in 17 states and on a couple bases overseas as well,” she explained.It’s a youth soccer program that focuses on serving military children and their friends, according to the website.Amy used to play for the Cincinnati Lady Hawks USL women’s league in 2004 and now uses her love of the game to help keep kids active and incorporates it as another tool in the toolbox to help military kids get through deployments.“Just kind of as a feel-good story that okay, it was feeling weird.

S olskjaer’s position is under intense scrutiny after Sunday’s 5-0 humiliation at home by Liverpool triggered an inquest at the top of the club and it is understood significant parts of the dressing room have lost faith in the manager’s ability to take the club forward. Joel and Avram Glazer, United’s co-chairmen, held emergency talks with executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, and his expected successor, Richard Arnold, yesterday after a calamitous past few weeks that has sent their season into a tailspin. Senior sources at Old Trafford claimed last night that there had been “no change” to Solskjaer’s position but accepted that there was “a lot to do to turn things around”. One senior figure claimed the club had been “let off lightly” by Liverpool and that the scoreline could have been much worse after Paul Pogba was sent off with half an hour left and Jurgen Klopp’s side already five goals to the good. In a damning indictment of United’s woeful form, Luke Shaw, the left-back, admitted the Liverpool result had “been coming” and the display was “not good enough”. Antonio Conte is understood to want to succeed Solskjaer but the former Chelsea, Juventus and Inter Milan coach would seek full control and the Old Trafford hierarchy have previously held reservations about the demanding Italian, despite his outstanding coaching credentials and trophy haul. Sources at Old Trafford distanced themselves from claims in Italy yesterday that there had been conversations with Conte’s representatives. United were left scarred by Jose Mourinho’s tenure and any move for Conte may be considered to represent a departure from the club’s self-proclaimed “cultural reboot”.

Enter email address This field is required Sign Up Read More Mark Critchley: Opinion Conte waiting in the wings as players begin to lose faith in Ole Cosy club at United lack the ruthlessness to ‘shoot Bambi’ But United have been so wedded to Solskjaer, who signed a new three-year contract in the summer, that their sudden implosion has left the club’s decision-makers scrambling as they reflect on what has gone wrong and their options going forward. United have coveted Mauricio Pochettino, the former Tottenham coach, in the past but he remains in charge of Paris Saint-Germain and well-placed sources believe a lack of available candidates could be another factor influencing the club’s thinking. United face Tottenham, Atalanta and Manchester City before the international break next month in a crucial run of fixtures. They have taken just one point from the past 12 available in the league and trail leaders Chelsea by eight points in a season when Solskjaer was expected to mount a sustained title charge. Despite remaining well liked by players and staff, Solskjaer faces a challenge to convince the dressing room to pull behind him as faith in his methods erode. He tore into the players at half-time of the Liverpool game, with his team trailing 4-0, before issuing a rallying call afterwards when he urged the players to “fight” their way back from what he described as “rock bottom” and his “darkest day” in football. Yet multiple dressing-room sources have indicated that Solskjaer no longer has the trust of a number of players, opinions that have hardened over a dreadful past week during which time United have conceded 11 goals in three games and looked hopelessly disorganised. Solskjaer’s tactical acumen, selections, reluctance to make big decisions and indulgence of underperforming players and star names have all been called into question as results and performances have gone from bad to worse. One dressing-room source said there was disbelief among some players that Solskjaer and his coaching staff had picked the same team to play against Liverpool who had been taken apart defensively in the first half against Atalanta in the Champions League four days earlier. Solskjaer is understood to have been challenged by a number of players during frank exchanges before the Atalanta game, when United came from two goals down to win 3-2. Eric Bailly is believed to have asked why the manager picked his fellow centre-half Harry Maguire to play in the 4-2 defeat at Leicester City a few days earlier, despite the captain being unfit after three weeks out with a calf injury. Maguire endured a miserable game but kept his place for Atalanta and Liverpool, when he committed more glaring individual errors.

"Clare plan reflective of GAA’s growing shift towards professional environment","https://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-games/clare-plan-reflective-of-gaas-growing-shift-towards-professional-environment-40984419.html","['GAA']","","","At 5pm yesterday, applications closed for the position of Donegal GAA senior athletic performance coach.","","2021-10-26 01:30:00","At 5pm yesterday, applications closed for the position of Donegal GAA senior athletic performance coach. I t’s a new position that falls under the watch of the games performance manager and will, according to the job specification, see the successful candidate be “primarily responsible for the physical development, coaching and monitoring of senior and incoming senior development players progressing from the underage structure.” It’s a role that may not be as broad as the high performance management brief that the former All-Ireland winning captain Bryan Cullen occupies in Dublin but still shows ambition on Donegal’s behalf to provide a suitable bridgehead between their underage and senior players nonetheless. Mayo are also in the market for a games development performance administrator who will be “responsible for overseeing the implementation of agreed programmes in clubs, schools and other units in Mayo” and also “organise develop and monitor programmes in physical fitness, nutrition and performance analysis to be delivered to all inter-county adult teams, U-20 teams, Talent Academies, clubs and post-primary schools.” The specification doesn’t just stop there but is so great you wonder how the successful candidate will fit it all into the 39 hours per week that the contract is for. Earlier in the year Mayo served notice of intent to re-advertise for the position of operations and finance manager when none of the applicants were deemed to have met the requirement of Croke Park’s HR department. Meath GAA has also been busy hiring, taking on Barry Horgan as general manager for underage football, a brief that will oversee development from U-13 to U-20 in the coming years.Horgan will be leaving the Australian Institute of Sport where he has been a performance scientist, having been head of performance, academy and pathways with Super Rugby club ACT Brumbies. In Wexford the current focus is on finding a commercial, communications and administration executive who will, according to the advertisement be “responsible for planning, developing, co-ordinating and implementing digital and print communications and content as well as supporting with the co-ordination of games, ticketing, events, announcements and launches” while also providing “key contributions to the success of commercial aspects of Wexford GAA.” This is just a snapshot of some of the GAA recruitment activity in counties as they re-emerge into the light after the darkness of Covid that hampered growth over the last 18 months. From finance to commercial activity and high performance counties are positioning themselves to reorganise and make gains over the next decade. Cork has already filled a host of key positions over the last two years, most recently Sinéad O’Keeffe was appointed as commercial director. Such activity all points on one direction. The GAA’s professional reach, not just at central or provincial level, is getting longer and longer. Nothing reflects that more than the work of Clare’s Strategic Plan Group which last week published a five-year plan for the county that is well-crafted, wide-ranging and looks under the bonnet of every vehicle driving the games in the county. After a fractious birth last spring, the group’s work has been widely welcomed in Clare as an honest appraisal and framework for the county’s future. Governance features prominently in their findings, a common theme across the GAA spectrum, while there is a damning critique of the current executive which, the authors say, is not “fit for purpose”. Clare is a mid-sized GAA county, currently with a population of 119,000 and 54 clubs with a reasonable balance between hurling and football. Read More Clare boss Colm Collins is positive a quick solution can be found to championship crux GPA takes first steps to put SFC reform back on the Congress agenda in February But while the critique of present structures has been one of the most highlighted aspects of the document, on top of the estimated €2.4m to bring Caherlohan up to spec, it is the professional road that the group envisage for Clare GAA over the next two years that is most eye-catching. The level of that ambition will come at a significant cost and again is reflective of a shifting dynamic – the move towards executive and professional hands. They are proposing the development of 19 new full-time roles, most in coaching and games development. At the top of it is a new overarching chief executive role, supported by a finance manager and commercial manager. Beyond that, provisions are being made for full-time hurling and football performance managers and a head of athlete development, roles that will largely merge through the medium of the county’s Academy structures. The report suggests that Clare needs to “urgently” add 10 games promotion officers (GPO) to the three currently in place at a cost of around €300,000. In its list of targets, six of those additional GPO roles would be followed by 2022 with a further four on board for 2023. In addition, there is the call for three more Games Development Administrators (GDA). As ever with these plans, only a fraction of it is likely to come to fruition but even at that it will represent a lot and is a document worth examining by other counties of similar profile. It’s quite clear that volunteer roles within the Association are becoming more pressurised with the requirement for better governance, efficiency and delivery of targets and the onset of more professional hands are increasing. But the GAA at a broader level needs to be mindful of how much of this kind of professionalism it can shoulder without tipping the balance too much away from its amateur players.

I t is rare to see a United official of Arnold’s level occupy the same corridors as the press on a match day and rarer still, at critical moments like these, to see one move so quickly. The ambiguity around Arnold’s own position is evidence of that. He is expected to succeed Ed Woodward as United’s executive vice-chairman and most senior executive outside of the Glazer family, though six months after the Super League debacle and the subsequent announcement that Woodward would step down from his role at the end of the year, a definitive date for the succession is yet to be confirmed. Given how slowly things can move at Old Trafford, Solskjaer could have been confident of outlasting Woodward and working under his successor, even if the new campaign started sluggishly with new signings taking time to settle in. The new three-year contract signed during the summer suggested as much, as did Mike Phelan’s new deal and proposed extensions for coaches Michael Carrick and Kieran McKenna. Sunday’s result, however, was the type which can move things along and move them along quickly. Club sources last night were playing down talk of any change, albeit while admitting that the result was painful and that there is much to do to turn the season around. It is easy to forget that United went 28 years without sacking a manager within recent memory and it can at times appear as if they are willing to give an incumbent every chance. David Moyes’ doomed succession of Alex Ferguson was only brought to an end once a top-four finish and Champions League qualification became impossible. The same was true with Louis van Gaal. Jose Mourinho is the exception, dismissed mid-season but only as the environment inside the club had become toxic to the point of no return.

Enter email address This field is required Sign Up Read More Cosy club at United lack the ruthlessness to ‘shoot Bambi’ Pressure mounting on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as Manchester United players are open to a new manager Today, the atmosphere is nothing like as poisonous as during Mourinho’s final hours. On the contrary, even during his most difficult days in charge, it has always been remarked how popular Solskjaer is with the players. Some feel as though they owe him for helping to turn their careers around. And yet, there is dressing-room disquiet once more. Concerns regarding Solskjaer’s tactical acumen and selections are understood to have grown after Sunday’s defeat. Though there is no animosity towards the United manager, a number of players have felt exposed by Solskjaer’s questionable tactical set-ups in games, while others feel those on the fringes like Jesse Lingard and Donny van de Beek have not been offered opportunities to improve a struggling team. Whether that will be enough for United to go in a different direction was an open question yesterday evening. If Solskjaer is dismissed, Antonio Conte would be interested in replacing him. The former Internazionale manager – renowned for delivering success quickly – would require assurances about his role within the structure at Old Trafford and the vision behind the scenes. As of yesterday , no formal discussions had taken place. Conte is a superb coach, with a reputation that surpasses that of the other available and elite-level names linked with the job, the three-time Champions League winning manager Zinedine Zidane. Not only does Conte have Premier League and Serie A titles from his two-year spells at Stamford Bridge and the San Siro, he is also the only manager in the last decade other than Pep Guardiola or Jurgen Klopp to break the English top-flight’s 90-point barrier, the mark true title contenders now seemingly must pass. It could be argued that Conte’s 93-point 2016-’17 title came at a point of relative weakness at the top of the Premier League. Guardiola and Klopp were in their first full seasons at City and Liverpool, so too was Mourinho at United. The defending champions, Leicester City, finished 12th. Chelsea’s closest challengers were a Tottenham Hotspur side managed by Mauricio Pochettino, who appears off-limits as a potential Solskjaer successor. Even with Conte’s record of delivering immediate success, beating Guardiola, Klopp and Thomas Tuchel to a title in double-quick time would be a different proposition, especially if his tenure had a typically short lifespan. His demanding and at times abrasive relationships with his employers is the antithesis of the collegial dynamic between Solskjaer, United’s newly restructured football department and Old Trafford’s key decision-makers. Whether United would be willing to undo two-and-a-half years’ work on a trumpeted ‘cultural reset’ in exchange for a short-term bet on success with Conte is unclear. It is the type of gamble that goes against a lot of what the Solskjaer era was meant to represent: steady, gradual progress aligned with the club’s core principles, with a view to achieving sustainable, long-term success. That there is said to be reticence regarding the prospect of appointing Conte among the United board is perhaps no surprise, in that respect. Things change, though, and at United, it can sometimes feel as though after years where nothing happens, there are weeks where years happen. Solskjaer is s till in a job, though his position is more vulnerable than ever.

T he former England captain had already defended himself from criticism by human rights groups over his World Cup ambassadorial role, which is said to be worth £15 million (€17.8m) a year. His deal with Qatar comes after a year in which “David Beckham Ventures Limited”, the brand management firm owned with his wife, fell £3.5m to £11.3m in 2019. A further decline in profits had appeared likely due to Covid-19. “From Beckham’s perspective, I would be very surprised if he would have leapt at the opportunity to act as Qatar’s ambassador were it not for the outrageous sum that is being offered to him,” Marcel Knobil, founder of Superbrands and the Brand Council consultancy, said. “As good as this is for Qatar, it’s equally as bad for Beckham, who is a magnificent figure to use to try to eclipse the negative perceptions that the country has earned.” Beckham was part of the consortium that finalised a buy-out at Inter Miami this summer. However, Conrad Wiacek, head of sport analysis at analytics firm GlobalData, warned ‘Brand Beckham’ is potentially “under threat” as a result of his association with a Middle East nation criticised by LGBT+ and workers’ rights groups. “While it can be argued that Beckham’s involvement will shed light on some of the perceived injustices, brands may look to distance themselves from any hint of controversy,” Wiacek said. Sources close to the former player – who has been a Unicef goodwill ambassador since 2005 – insisted he was working with the nation because he believes in the “power of football to inspire positive change”.

Read More","2021-10-26 01:26:06","Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Monday signed into law a bill banning transgender girls from participating in female sports at public schools, joining a wave of similar measures emerging from Republican-controlled statehouses across the country. Supporters of the bill, due to take effect on Jan. 18, say it is aimed at protecting fairness in school sports by eliminating what they see as an inherent physical competitive advantage of transgender athletes playing on female teams. Equal rights advocates decry such restrictions as discriminatory, “hate”-based measures whose real purpose is to energize hard-core social conservatives, with little or no evidence that trans women or girls are dominating sports. Seven other states have passed similar laws this year, part of a Republican-led national campaign since Idaho in March 2020 barred athletes who were assigned a male gender at birth from competing on sports teams against those assigned as female in public schools or colleges. Enforcement of the Idaho ban has been blocked by a federal court pending the outcome of a legal challenge against the measure. Other states whose legislatures have followed Idaho’s lead include Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Mississippi, Montana, Tennessee and West Virginia, while South Dakota’s governor acted by executive order. Some of those are likewise under court challenge. Still, at least 35 bills to exclude transgender youth from athletics have been introduced in 31 states this year, up from 29 in 2020 and two in 2019, according to a tally earlier this year by the National Conference of State Legislatures. The transgender sports measure marks the latest in a slate of right-wing bills advanced by Texas’ legislature and Republican governor this year, including laws placing new restrictions on voting and abortion while doing away with the need for a permit to carry a concealed weapon.

"Seven killed, 140 injured in Sudan protests following coup","https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/seven-killed-140-injured-in-sudan-protests-following-coup-683097","","","","The leader of the takeover, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, dissolved the military-civilian Sovereign Council that had been established to guide the country to democracy.","","2021-10-26 01:25:59","Sudan's military seized power from a transitional government on Monday and a health ministry official said seven people were killed by gunfire and 140 injured in clashes between soldiers and street protesters. The leader of the takeover, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, dissolved the military-civilian Sovereign Council that had been established to guide the country to democracy following the overthrow of long-ruling autocrat Omar al-Bashir in a popular uprising two years ago. Burhan announced a state of emergency, saying the armed forces needed to protect safety and security. He promised to hold elections in July 2023 and hand over to an elected civilian government then. ""What the country is going through now is a real threat and danger to the dreams of the youth and the hopes of the nation,"" he said. The Sudan information ministry, which is still loyal to ousted Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, said on its Facebook page that the transitional constitution gives only the prime minister the right to declare a state of emergency and that the military's actions are a crime. Hamdok is still the legitimate transitional authority, it said. The U.N. Security Council was likely to discuss Sudan behind closed doors on Tuesday, diplomats said. White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said: ""We reject the actions by the military and call for the immediate release of the prime minister and others who have been placed under house arrest."" Youths opposed to the coup barricaded streets and clashed with troops. The main opposition coalition, Forces of Freedom and Change, which pushed for Bashir's removal and negotiated the military-civilian council, said on Twitter it was calling for peaceful actions in the streets to overthrow the military takeover, including demonstrations, the blocking of streets and civil disobedience. Sudan Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok speaks during joint press conference with German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas in Khartoum, Sudan September 3, 2019 (credit: REUTERS/ MOHAMED NURELDIN ABDALLAH) Hamdok, an economist and former senior U.N. official, was detained and taken to an undisclosed location after refusing to issue a statement in support of the takeover, the information ministry said. The ministry urged resistance and said tens of thousands of people opposed to the takeover had taken to the streets and had faced gunfire near the military headquarters in Khartoum. Central bank employees announced a strike to reject the coup, the ministry said. Troops had arrested civilian members of the Sovereign Council and government figures, the ministry said. Also detained was the news director of state TV, his family said. The U.S. State Department said Washington had nothing to share on Hamdok's whereabouts and condition. A department spokesman said it was pausing $700 million in economic support for Sudan. In Khartoum's twin city Omdurman, protesters barricaded streets and chanted in support of civilian rule. ""Burhan cannot deceive us. This is a military coup,"" said a young man who gave his name as Saleh. Sudan has been ruled for most of its post-colonial history by military leaders who seized power in coups. It had become a pariah to the West and was on a U.S. terrorism list under Bashir, who hosted Osama bin Laden in the 1990s and is wanted by the International Criminal Court in the Hague for war crimes. The country had been on edge since last month when a failed coup plot, blamed on Bashir supporters, unleashed recriminations between the military and civilians. In recent weeks a coalition of rebel groups and political parties aligned themselves with the military and called on it to dissolve the civilian government, while Cabinet ministers took part in protests against the prospect of military rule. Sudan is also in an economic crisis. Helped by foreign aid, civilian officials have claimed credit for some tentative signs of stabilization after a sharp devaluation of the currency and the lifting of fuel subsidies. Washington had tried to avert the collapse of the power-sharing agreement by sending a special envoy, Jeffrey Feltman. The director of Hamdok's office, Adam Hereika, told Reuters the military had mounted the takeover despite ""positive movements"" towards an agreement after meetings with Feltman in recent days. The military had been meant to pass on leadership of the Sovereign Council to a civilian figure in the coming months. But transitional authorities had struggled to move forward on issues including whether to hand Bashir over to the Hague. Burhan said it was incumbent on the armed forces to act to halt ""incitement to chaos and violence."" The United Nations, Arab League and African Union all expressed concern. Political leaders should be released and human rights respected, AU Commission Chair Moussa Faki Mahamat said in a statement. Britain called the coup an unacceptable betrayal of the Sudanese people. France called for the immediate release of Hamdok and other civilian leaders. Egypt called on all parties to exercise self-restraint. The Sudanese Professionals Association, an activist coalition in the uprising against Bashir, called for a strike. Two main political parties, the Umma and the Sudanese Congress, condemned what they called a coup and campaign of arrests.","","jpost"

The first is whether to stick with a manager who has clearly hit his zenith, and has shown no evidence to suggest that more highs are on the horizon. The second is who to replace him with. According to reports, Manchester United’s owners have been locked in talks about whether to replace Ole Gunnar Solskjaer or not in the 24 hours following the moment the club hit “rock bottom” with the 5-0 home defeat to arch-rivals Liverpool . They are still undecided on Solskjaer’s fate, having only handed him a brand new three-year contract at the end of last season and backed him further by handing his assistant Mike Phelan a new three-year deal just weeks ago. Both David Moyes and Jose Mourinho were sacked 48 hours after losing in a Sunday kick-off game (UK time) so if a decision is to be taken, it will likely be made by Wednesday morning (AEDT).

BUT ‘MONSTROUSLY BAD’ MAN UTD ARE TOO ‘TERRIFIED’ TO READ IT THEATRE OF SCREAMS: MAN UNITED SUFFER ‘DARKEST DAY’ IN FIVE-GOAL REDS NIGHTMARE Given it’s so early into the season, a permanent manager will need to be found, rather than an interim one installed until the end of the season , as was what happened initially with Solskjaer. And the name that is leading the way is that of former Chelsea and Internazionale manager Antonio Conte. According to reports, Conte is open to becoming the new Manchester United manager, with Italian media suggesting contact has already been made with him from the club. He considers United a “special” club that he would be very interested in taking over and believes that he can be successful with the current squad of players. He is usually reticent at taking a job when offered it in the middle of a season, but for a role like the one at Old Trafford, he would do it. He is the best coach available to the club at the moment and has a long history of winning silverware, something United have not been able to do since 2017 when Jose Mourinho won the League Cup and the Europa League in the same season. Conte first made his name at Juventus, the club he won five Serie A titles and a Champions League with as a player and one that he would go on to win three more Serie A title with as a manager. It’s the sort of pedigree as a former player that commands respect, like Solskjaer or Zinedine Zidane at Real Madrid – an important trait in getting players immediately on your side. He also ticks the Premier League experience box, winning a title in his first season at Chelsea with a revolutionary tactical masterclass of transforming out-of-favour players into starring wing-backs as he set a then record for the most consecutive league wins in a single season. He won 30 of 38 Premier League games that season – at the time another record. Could Ole get the chop after HUGE loss? | 05:05 He then went and did the same at Inter, this time ending Juventus’ nine-year stranglehold on the Serie A title in his second season at the club, after finishing as runner-up in the league and the Europa League in his debut season. Make no mistake, if you’re looking for an instant impact, Conte is your man. His spell at Juventus coincided with the arrival of Paul Pogba and subsequently the most prolific period of the Frenchman’s career to date, where forged his reputation as one of the best midfielders in the world – one that he has clung onto since returning to Manchester United, without ever replicated the form that earned him it in the first place. Conte was able to find his best position, something both Mourinho and Solskjaer have failed to do, and reaped the benefits of it. If United’s hierarchy want someone to persuade the World Cup winner to sign a new deal at the club, Conte is again your man. But it’s not just Pogba he can rejuvenate. Jesse Lingard looks like he was born to play in a Conte team, while Donny van de Beek, who was nominated for the Ballon d’Or before joining United, is in desperate need of a fresh start like the ones the Italian gave the likes of Alexis Sanchez, Victor Moses, Ashley Young, Romelu Lukaku and many, many more. He has the experience of successfully managing a club bursting with egos and players who have been reported as difficult to deal with in the past, including Eden Hazard, Diego Costa, Sanchez and Lukaku but to name a few. However, Conte’s successes come with the acknowledgment that they’d don’t usually last very long and often end with relationships pushed all of the way to breaking point – with players and the board. The Italian is said to want total control of the club if he agrees to take the reins at Manchester United, from training, to personnel, to transfers and everything else in between. He is very much a hands-on coach. And that has led to clashes in the past. It’s why he left Inter just weeks after winning Serie A, as he feuded with the club’s board over transfer for the following season. It’s why he was also sacked as Chelsea manager shortly after winning the FA Cup in his second season, as he butted heads with star striker Diego Costa, leading to the player effectively going on strike for the first half of the season until a move to Atletico Madrid was eventually agreed. United humiliated as Reds score 5! | 01:28 He is known for imposing strict diets and curfews on his players, who are given a very short leash to socialise on and is not afraid of pulling out the hairdryer in the ilk of Sir Alex Ferguson back in his heyday. It is part of the reason his teams do so well initially, with an injection of fresh motivation and he puts blinkers on his players and points them in the direction of a trophy. But it’s also the reason that his longest spell at a club is just three seasons. Conte averages less than two years in a job across his 15 years of managerial experience before exiting to find something new, a huge concern for a club like Manchester United who have buried their heads in the sand so deep in order to keep faith with Solskjaer in the hope he can build a dynasty in the face of all the evidence to the contrary. Conte is a tactical mastermind who likes high-energy runners, things that has been a major criticism of Solskjaer’s tenure, with the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo in particular coming under fierce scrutiny for his lack of workrate off the ball, and he is not alone in that. But for all the celebration around Ronaldo’s homecoming, would a highly commercially-minded Manchester United take the risk of upsetting their golden goose? The most marketable club in the world want to have the most marketable player in the world on the pitch at all times. The uproar when Conte would inevitably drop Ronaldo for not fitting into his system would not sit well with those who paid all that money to get him. As Gary Neville put it, after spending three years of watching Solskjaer successfully completing a “cultural reset” after the toxic ending to the Mourinho era, they don’t want a “hitman” to come in and undo it all again. Yellow not enough, Pogba sees RED | 00:31 Speaking on Sky Sports, Neville said: “They won’t bring a hitman in again. A hitman who comes in and does a job for two years. Conte’s available but I wouldn’t bring him to Manchester United. I wouldn’t bring him here now, I wouldn’t. “I don’t think Antonio Conte is a fit for Manchester United. I don’t think he’s a fit. I might be wrong, they might bring him here tomorrow and I’d get behind him. “We’ve seen a coach with a specific style like Louis Van Gaal didn’t work here. I’m not saying there isn’t a manager who can come to Manchester United and do well.” Ultimately the biggest question Manchester United must answer is if, with Conte, the reward outweighs the risk. They’ve put short-term success ahead of a long-term vision before and it’s taken Solskjaer three years to fix it. Yes, he could be the antidote to Manchester United’s current mess, but he could also become the poison that put Solskjaer there in the first place. Is it a gamble they’re willing to take again?","","foxsports"

Go and read the tidal wave of vitriolic whining that's been set off by the North Dakota Department of Health's decision to cut off comments on its Facebook posts. The statement put out by the department says, starting Tuesday, October 26, the comments will be cut off for all posts and topics, but their statement also says the decision was made as a way to stem the flow of misinformation. We can safely conclude that this is about COVID-19 and vaccines. The anti-vaxxers have been using the department's Facebook posts as a platform for their nonsense, and the department apparently decided they were under no obligation to provide a venue for the ignorant. And, hey, they're right. I read many of the comments so you don't have to (you can thank me later), and as you might imagine a lot of the complaints are casting this move as some sort of effort to crush dissent, but that doesn't make any sense. Facebook is a wide-open medium. Anybody who wants to put their two cents in on a Department of Health post can share that post and write what they please. They can take screen captures of the post and share it on other social media platforms. They can write blog posts about it or letters to the editor. They can contact their lawmakers, their congressman and even the governor's office if they feel sufficiently motivated. Nobody is being silenced. Further, this move may save the Department of Health some resources now that there are no comments for the staff there to monitor. Frankly, I think the good people at the department have better things to do than proctor the inanities Facebook keyboard warriors choose to share with the world. I wish this wasn't necessary. I wish more people would find something better to do with their lives than rail on about conspiracy theories in Facebook comment threads. But we are obliged to live with the world as it is, not as we wish it to be. I say we find whoever it is at the Department of Health who is responsible for this decision and give them a raise.

Read More","2021-10-26 01:23:36","Oklahoma need not delay a planned resumption of executions set for this week while a court case challenging the state’s three-drug protocol for killing condemned inmates is adjudicated, a federal judge ruled on Monday. Judge Stephen Friot of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma denied five death row prisoners’ request for a preliminary injunction after a hearing Monday. Lawyers for the inmates, including one whose execution is scheduled Thursday, immediately appealed. The lack of reprieve for the five inmates including John Grant, whose execution has been set for Thursday, comes even as support for the death penalty is diminishing nationwide. Thirty-six U.S. states and the District of Columbia have either abolished the death penalty or have not carried out an execution in the past 10 years, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Oklahoma has not carried out executions in six years, since three botched attempts ending with the death of Charles Frederick Warner in 2015. Warner, who was convicted of the rape and murder of an 11-month-old baby, was executed using the wrong drug, officials said later. The previous year, Clayton Lockett, convicted of murder, rape and kidnapping, regained consciousness and raised his head after the execution procedure began, only to die in apparent anguish less than an hour later, court records show. Also in 2014, condemned inmate Michael Wilson’s final words were, “I feel my whole body burning,” attorneys wrote in a lawsuit challenging the execution procedure. “The district court itself has acknowledged serious questions about whether Oklahoma’s execution procedures will cause prisoners unconstitutional pain and suffering,” Dale Baich, an attorney for the inmates, said in a statement. “With a trial on that very question set to begin in February, executions should not go forward.” Thirty-two death row inmates in Oklahoma joined the lawsuit, which is set for trial next February. Six of them, including Grant and Julius Jones, who for decades has maintained his innocence and whose case has drawn the attention of celebrities, were removed from the lawsuit by a judge, leading the state to schedule execution dates. A federal appeals court reinstated them to the suit on Oct. 15, prompting their attorneys to request the execution dates be postponed. A spokesperson for Oklahoma Attorney General John M. O’Connor said he had no comment on Monday, before the ruling. O’Connor’s representatives could not be reached for comment after the ruling was issued.

"Does Wobbuffet have any uses in Pokemon GO?","https://www.sportskeeda.com/pokemon/does-wobbuffet-uses-pokemon-go?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=sportskeeda","['Pokemon']","['Spencer Whitworth']","","","","2021-10-26 01:15:30","Wobbuffet has had a reputation in the Pokemon series for being something of a joke, but it has its applications in Pokemon GO , specifically in PvP combat. In short, Wobbuffet isn't exactly a great option in combat for the most part, but it has significant contributions to the current Great League meta game if used wisely by its trainer. Pokemon GO's PvP is constantly evolving, but Wobbuffet has found a comfortable niche in the Great League thanks to its max stamina stats clocking in at the third-best in the game. It also has access to Counter, Pokemon GO's best Fighting-type Fast Move. Although its maximum CP still puts it firmly behind many of its competitors in Pokemon GO's Great League, Wobbuffet can still handle more than a few matchups thanks to its high health, making it difficult to take it out at a quick pace without taking advantage of its type weakness to Bug, Dark , and Ghost-type moves. Wobbuffet's moveset also doesn't give it many damage options despite Counter being a solid move, with Mirror Coat being the only move in its collection capable of obtaining a Same Type Attack Bonus (STAB). Although these downsides are significant, Wobbuffet can still win many battles of attrition in Pokemon GO Great League PvP. Counter's damage and energy generation add up, and if players opt to purify a Shadow Wobbuffet, Return can serve as an upgrade at the Charge Move position over Mirror Coat. That being said, Mirror Coat can still be picked up as a secondary Charge Move if a trainer needs it. It's rare for Return to be considered a solid move option, but considering Wobbuffet's strengths and ability to stay in a fight and take a beating, it actually performs well. It won't ever threaten its Pokemon GO opponents with damage, but bringing Wobbuffet out as a defender is still a wise choice in lieu of using Pokemon such as Blissey, Miltank, or Snorlax . If trainers can force their opposition into hitting the brick wall that is Wobbuffet until better opportunities arrive, this Pokemon portrayed as a punchline can cause more than a few headaches on its own.","https://static.sportskeeda.com/editor/2021/10/575ad-16351976183064-1920.jpg","sportskeeda"

Shawn Tan...","Shawn Tan Jia Jun (right) outside the State Courts in Singapore October 25, 2021. — TODAY pic Follow us on Instagram and subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates. SINGAPORE, Oct 26 — During an argument with his pregnant girlfriend over whether to keep or abort their baby, a 24-year-old man repeatedly punched and kicked her abdomen and face, causing multiple bruises and a possible bone fracture.Shawn Tan Jia Jun, 24, was fined S$3,500 (about RM 10,785) yesterday after pleading guilty to one count of voluntarily causing hurt to his girlfriend, who was nine weeks pregnant.The court heard that the assault took place on July 15 last year, five days after the couple found out about the pregnancy.Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Tan Pei Wei said that they had visited a women’s clinic, and the doctor warned his girlfriend that if she wanted an abortion, they should come to a decision before July 17 to prevent further risk of medical complications, On the day of the assault, Tan and his girlfriend got into a heated dispute at his place when they were discussing what to do with the pregnancy. Court documents did not disclose who took which side of the argument.In the midst of the argument, Tan pushed his girlfriend onto the bed before he punched and kicked her abdomen many times. He also repeatedly punched her face.Tan’s mother, who was at home at the time, heard the commotion and stopped the dispute. The victim later called her friend, who accompanied her out of Tan’s home.Later that day, Tan’s girlfriend sought treatment at the National University Hospital where she reported pain on her face, chest and abdomen. She also had several bruises over her upper and lower limbs.She was diagnosed with a possible bone fracture on her face, but was unable to be X-rayed to confirm the diagnosis as that would risk exposing the foetus to radiation.An ultrasound scan also showed that the foetus’ heart was beating, DPP Tan said, who sought at least two weeks’ jail for Tan.Tan’s lawyer, Terence Yeo from TSMP Law Corporation, told the court that Tan had not set out to cause any harm to his girlfriend.He said that Tan had hit his girlfriend while she tried to stop him from leaving the bedroom.“It was an instinctive and impulsive reaction to what had happened then,” Yeo said, adding that Tan was young and stressed out at the time and had acted disproportionately.Although his girlfriend aborted the baby after the incident, the couple has since gotten back together and will be getting married later this year, Yeo said.Tan’s girlfriend has forgiven him and had approached the police and asked them to drop the charge against Tan, the lawyer added.During sentencing, District Judge Wong Li Tein said she noted the prosecution’s argument that Tan’s assault on his girlfriend while she was pregnant was particularly serious.However, she said that his girlfriend had probably accepted that Tan did not harm her in the “vicious sense”, but that the incident arose spontaneously out of a dispute over whether to keep the baby, which had to be decided over a short period of time.Since his girlfriend has agreed to marry him, this establishes that she had forgiven him, the judge added.“That, to me, should be the greatest victory to you, more than any light sentence you might receive,” District Judge Wong said to Tan.For voluntarily causing hurt, Tan could have been jailed for up to three years or fined up to S$5,000, or punished with both. — TODAY","2021-10-26 01:15:00","","","malaymail"

"Dana White addresses Nate Diaz possibly leaving UFC, advises Kayla Harrison to stay in PFL","https://www.mmafighting.com/2021/10/25/22745876/dana-white-addresses-nate-diaz-possibly-leaving-ufc-advises-kayla-harrison-to-stay-in-pfl","","['Damon Martin']","","","Free agency has become much more commonplace in MMA in recent years, but two very high-profile fighters are likely to hit the open market in the near future. With one fight left on his current contract in the UFC, Nate Diaz has made it clear that he wants to compete sooner rather than later after previously calling out Vicente Luque and Tony Ferguson. All signs point to Diaz completing his contract and then testing the free agency market, though he could obviously re-sign with the UFC before he books that final fight. That said, UFC President Dana White can’t say with absolutely certainly that Diaz will return to the promotion he’s called home since 2007. But he’ll leave that up to the former “BMF’ title challenger to decide. “That’s a decision he needs to make,” White said when speaking with TSN. “Listen, for a lot of these guys, there’s no secret about it. If you believe that you are one of the best in the world and you believe you can win a world title here, or hang with the top five, then this is where you should be. “The minute that you start doubting that is the case, you’ve got to start looking at other options.” While discussing the situation with Diaz and his contract, White referenced former heavyweight champion Junior Dos Santos, who was very unhappy with the way he was treated prior to his release from the promotion. White downplayed the complaints and instead pointed to the shortcomings Dos Santos had in the octagon, which is what he says ultimately decided whether or not he’d maintain a spot on the UFC roster. “Junior Dos Santos said some stuff the other day that he was upset, and I was all about money and the way that he left [the UFC],” White said. “Listen, he’s in his 40s now. He’s on a four- or five-fight losing streak, and there comes a time and a day where I have to make a decision when a guy keeps losing and he’s at a certain age, this just isn’t the place to be anymore. “There’s tons of other places where you can go fight and where you can make a lot of money. A lot of these guys once they’ve built and established their name here, move on to these other promotions and make crazy money. And good for them. That’s just how it works.” By comparison, White can’t be certain what Diaz is thinking. “As far as Nate Diaz goes, I don’t know where Nate feels he is right now and what he feels his future could be if he signs another four- or five-fight deal here, “ White said. As Diaz contemplates his future after 14 years spent with the UFC, two-time Olympic gold medalist Kayla Harrison is about to truly test her free agency for the first time. When she was a coveted prospect with a background in judo, Harrison hadn’t established herself in the cage. But with a perfect 11-0 record ahead of her fight in the 2021 PFL finals on Wednesday, she’s now proven that she ranks among the best fighters in the world. Harrison hasn’t truly addressed her free agency as she’s remained focused on her upcoming fight while also depending on her manager Ali Abdelaziz to continue working for her behind the scenes. There will definitely be options beyond the PFL once Harrison hits the open market, but White said she’s actually better served by just staying where she’s at right now. “Kayla Harrison’s a great example,” White said. “[PFL] pays her an obscene amount of money to fight over there. If I was her, I’d stay right where she is and keep picking off the people over here. When you come here [to the UFC], Amanda Nunes is no joke. [Valentina] Shevchenko is no joke. Rose Namajunas is [no joke]. These are all the best women in the world. These are the best female fighters in the world. “I don’t blame her. I would stay there and keep fighting the type of women she’s fighting there before I would come here and fight an Amanda Nunes.” White has waffled back and forth in the past when asked for his interest in Harrison but it looks like he’s not quite ready to make a serious push to pursue her now even as she approaches free agency in a matter of days.","2021-10-26 01:00:00","Free agency has become much more commonplace in MMA in recent years, but two very high-profile fighters are likely to hit the open market in the near future.

The company is currently facing a $5 million lawsuit over its Frosted Strawberry Pop-Tarts. | Wilfredo Lee, Associated Press Kellogg’s is in a legal jam as its Frosted Strawberry Pop-Tarts are under scrutiny Kellogg’s is in a legal jam as its Frosted Strawberry Pop-Tarts are under scrutiny for not containing enough strawberries. What is the Kellogg’s Pop-Tart lawsuit about? In a recent lawsuit, Kellogg Sales Company is accused of misleading its customers by giving the impression that Frosted Strawberry Pop-Tarts contain “a greater relative and absolute amount of strawberries than it does,” USA Today reported. The lawsuit, filed by Anita Harris of Illinois, asks for the company to embrace more accurate labeling practices and is seeking more than $5 million in damages, NBC 10 Philadelphia reported. “Plaintiff bought the product because she expected it would have more of the named fruit ingredient,” the lawsuit states, according to NBC 10 Philadelphia. “Plaintiff wanted more than a ‘strawberry taste,’ which she nevertheless failed to receive. … Plaintiff would not have purchased the product if she knew the representations were false and misleading.” The lawsuit claims that while Kellogg’s advertising makes the strawberries the “characterizing ingredient” in the Pop-Tart, dried strawberries appear on the ingredient list under the “contains 2% or less” section, in addition to other fruits like dried pears and apples. The lawsuit also notes that the Frosted Strawberry Pop-Tart includes Red 40, a food dye that makes the Pop-Tart appear to have more strawberries than it does. “Without the added coloring, consumers would be suspect of a product labeled as ‘strawberry,’” the lawsuit reads, according to NBC 10 Philadelphia, and would lead consumers to “inspect the ingredient list to determine the truth.” What is the goal of the Kellogg’s Pop-Tart lawsuit? Kellogg’s told The Hill that it doesn’t comment on “pending litigation.” But according to Harris’ lawyer, the purpose of the lawsuit is to get Kellogg’s to promote its products “in a more truthful and transparent manner,” according to TODAY Food. “If it doesn’t have mostly strawberries, if it’s mostly pears, then you know, just call it pear Pop-Tarts,” Harris’ lawyer, Spencer Sheehan, told TODAY Food. “I don’t know why you have to call it strawberry if it’s a mix of pears and apples and strawberries.”","2021-10-26 01:00:00","Kellogg’s is in a legal jam as its Frosted Strawberry Pop-Tarts are under scrutiny for not containing enough strawberries.

When lockdown hit the Hunter again in August, owners Tony Langford and Sara Cooley closed their mobile van operation, which had traded in The Cambridge carpark since early 2019, and reassessed their business. ""It was a fluke of a find, it's a three-minute walk from our old spot,"" said Mr Langford of the Bishopsgate Street site. The couple have signed a two-year lease for the industrial corner block, which had been vacant except for a small garage, and is close to Newcastle Interchange. ""It's a house-size block and it reminds us of the van when we used to trade in our backyard at Tighes Hill, when we first started,"" Mr Langford said, adding that the ""old van"" had retired. IN THE NEWS: Shaded by trees including a mulberry, and greened by newly planted shrubs, Transient Tea's ""garage block"" houses its original Italian coffee machine, newly sprayed in an ivy green hue. ""Technically we are still mobile because its on a mobile coffee cart,"" Mr Langford says. The couple did most of the fit-out and Mr Langford, a veteran artist, painted its large mural. A sketch he did of the coffee machine is printed on the coffee cups. Transient Tea uses beans from local coffee roastery Glitch, tea from Blackwood Apothecary and sweet treats from Port Stephens business A Sweet Ride with Clyde. Mr Langford said his business was not hugely affected by the initial 2020 lockdown however the 2021 lockdown had prompted a rethink. ""We were trying to diversity our customer base, going from people in office to having residents around as well. We wanted to keep the business simple but COVID teaches you to look at things in a more fluid way and make necessary changes,"" he says. BACK WHERE IT ALL STARTED: Transient Tea opens at The Cambridge When Transient reopened in its new location on Monday, October 19, there were some of its loyal clientele waiting. ""That settled the nerves a bit, it was really nice, and we've had a lot of interest from the apartment blocks here,"" Mr Langford said. ""The work life is a bit easier, we are having to pack up and down the van, we can just leave and pull down the rollerdoor."" Transient's ""westside is the bestside"" slogan reflects the couple's love of quirky, urban and gritty spaces. ""We liked the basic industrial nature of a shed and this is a rare open green space in a growing part of the city. It suited our theme and our look, we like turning a rough city area into a green space... we've made the West End our own area."" Music is a passion of the couple and they have created their own Transient Garage playlist on Spotify. Though they have a lease for at least two years now, Mr Langford says their business name still holds true. ""From the beginning, 'Transient' was quite literal in regards to travelling in the van, and as the business grew it became more about the transient nature of ideas and concepts,"" he said. ""This is reflected in the ability to embrace change and accept the ebbs and flows of business and this has been particularly useful during COVID and has confirmed that the move from van to the garage is the correct decision...until our lease is done and we are transient again.""

"Planning on attending an open day? Do your homework first","https://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/planning-on-attending-an-open-day-do-your-homework-first-1.4703410?localLinksEnabled=false","","","","The country’s third-level campuses have been silent for the past 18 months. Small groups of students and staff may have been present for essential laboratory or practical classes but until recent weeks the normal activity associated with college life has been absent. Now, Ireland’s institutions have sprung back to life with freshers and second-year students on campus, for the first time in most cases. Unfortunately, as colleges are still exercising a good degree of caution in order to protect staff and students, in-person open days are still some distance off for some institutions. However, all third-level colleges hope to be able to bring prospective 2022 students on to campus before the end of the academic year, because the opportunity to physically experience the college environment – even if just for a few hours – can kickstart the process of thinking about the importance of maximising your performance in the Leaving Cert, as you consider the next step on your life-long career journey. It can also bring a greater focus to your interactions with your school guidance counsellor as you work together to identify the most suitable course option to pursue following the completion of your school life in June 2022. Whether you experience open days virtually or in person, the key to successfully making the transition to higher or further education is to concentrate on the suitability of the curriculum content, college facilities, availability of accommodation, or public transport links rather than the desired occupational area or specific job which they may hope to progress to following graduation. That task can become the focus of attention in four- or five-years’ time, when college life is coming to an end and the needs of the labour market in 2027/8 have become clear. Basic research Whatever the nature of the coming open days, you should undertake some basic research about the colleges you are considering and their course offerings prior to each event. After all, depending on the decision you will make by the close of the CAO course selection process on July 1st, 2022, and the course offer you eventually secure next August, you are committing several years of your life to this next stage of study and learning. You have probably already read the 2022 CAO Handbook and are exploring all third level and further educational college courses on offer in Ireland qualifax.ie. More than 6,000 students attended The Irish Times virtual Higher Options conference earlier this month, where they attended talks from experts in the field of further and higher education and spoke virtually to representatives of many colleges and courses. Of course Leaving Cert students are not only considering courses offered through the CAO. Thousands choose to study at their local Further Education (FE) college, where they can secure level 5 and 6 QQI awards facilitating entry to employment or into those CAO courses which reserve a percentage of their first-year undergraduate places for FE graduates. All FE colleges operate their own open days, often holding several such events throughout the academic year. Several thousand Irish students will apply for courses in Northern Ireland (particularly those living near the Border), Scotland or, in some cases, England, notwithstanding the £9,250 yearly fees. These applications are made through the UK Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (ucas.com). Some 2,200 Republic of Ireland applicants made that choice this year, including 850 who went to Northern Ireland. EU citizens can study in any EU country under the same terms and conditions as in their own country and thousands of Irish students have in the past 10 years chosen to study at one of the more than 1,000 courses taught through English in continental EU universities. These EU colleges also host virtual and in-person open days which Irish students can attend – low-cost air fares should help minimise the expense involved in attending such events. You can find out more about these events from the European Universities Central Application Support Service (eunicas.ie). Course content When exploring college options, be aware that the course is only a small part of what you will experience when you arrive on registration day in late August next year to start college life. You will be entering a community that will help shape you for the rest of your life. In our personal relationships we take time getting to know other people and every aspect of their personality before we commit to them. Selecting a course that will commit you to living your life within that community for at least three years should be considered just as carefully. The only way to evaluate whether a college is right for you is to explore all aspects of its life as fully as you can on its open day and see whether it feels right. This is more than an intellectual exercise. As a guidance counsellor and teacher for more than 40 years, I have dealt with many students whose minds were full of facts and figures about dozens of courses but could not differentiate between them. They were lost in a sea of data, with no guiding compass to make the right choice. Finest attire Would you commit yourself to a relationship with someone based on reading a fact sheet about their life so far? On a college open day, you will see the institution put its best foot forward. It is dressed in its finest attire, full of presentations, smiling student ambassadors, friendly lecturers and goodie bags, all designed to present the college in its best light. It can be hard to see the true nature of college life from such an experience. But you can see through a certain amount of the perfect presentation that every college puts on during open days, to the reality that lies behind. If you are particularly impressed with a college or course after an open day, observing whatever Covid-19 restrictions are in place at the time, try to go back on an ordinary day and wander around, to see if day-to-day normality gels with its open-day presentation.","","2021-10-26 01:00:00","The country’s third-level campuses have been silent for the past 18 months.

"Health benefits of beetroot, Check Here","https://www.sentinelassam.com/topheadlines/health-benefits-of-beetroot-check-here-560454","['Top Headlines']","['Sentinel Digital Desk']","","Beetroot has been gaining in popularity as a superfood.","MUMBAI: Beetroot has been gaining in popularity as a superfood. Recent studies claim that beets and beetroot juice can improve athletic performance, reduce blood pressure, and increase blood flow. So much so that an increasing number of juices and drinks are now incorporating this nutritious food.Beetroot comes from the same family as sugar beets. However, it is genetically and nutritionally different. Sugar beets are white, and manufacturers tend to use them for extracting sugar and sweetening processed foods. It is not possible to extract sugar from beetroot, which is mostly red or gold. Beetroot provides a wide range of possible health benefits, such as reducing blood pressure, improving digestion, and lowering the risk of diabetes. Beets contain an antioxidant called alpha-lipoic acid. This compound may help lower glucose levels and increase insulin sensitivity. One cup of beetroot provides 3.81 grams of fiber. Consuming enough fiber is essential for smooth digestion and gut health. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), a single cup of beets can provide more than 8.81% of a person's daily requirement of fiber, depending on their age and sex. Including beetroot in the diet is one way that a person can increase their fiber intake. Some studies have found that beetroot juice supplementation can improve the amount of oxygen that muscles absorb during exercise. Drinking beetroot juice can lead to red, purple, or pink urine or stools. Although this may seem alarming, it should not be a cause for medical concern. Doctors refer to this as ""beeturia.""

There were new Tasmanian devils, snow leopards, otters and a zebra to greet them.","","2021-10-26 00:58:34","The rainbow lorikeets knew it was opening time at Melbourne Zoo. Arriving in their dozens, they swooped between the trees and their feeding plates, squawking and screeching at nearly unbearable volumes. Between them stood three-year-old Nixon in his bucket hat, perfectly entranced by their frenzied start to the day. Three-year-old Nixon awoke at the crack of dawn for his return to the zoo. Credit: Eddie Jim Nixon’s grandmother, Karen Child, booked tickets for the zoo’s first day after the end of the state’s lockdown like they were Rolling Stones tickets: when she logged on to the Zoos Victoria website last week, she was number 5549 in the queue. “I waited and was successful, we’re here on the very first day and couldn’t have wished for more,” Ms Child says. “It’s just so important for us. Nixon was up at the crack of dawn, busting to get out the door. We come once a month at least, sometimes twice a month. Even for an hour or so. It’s just fun to bring the kids and they really enjoy it. ” Nixon and Ms Child were among 3000 visitors, mostly Zoos Victoria members, who pre-booked tickets to visit Melbourne Zoo on what turned out to be a cloudless Tuesday. Similar numbers were expected at the state’s other zoos, Healesville Sanctuary and Werribee Open Range. Families lined up at the gates before 9am on the zoo’s first day open again. Credit: Eddie Jim It marks the reopening of another Melbourne institution following almost three months shut during Victoria’s sixth lockdown, with thousands more tickets on sale from this weekend as the zoos’ indoor exhibitions reopen in line with restrictions easing at 80 per cent double dose vaccination coverage on Friday. Melbourne zoo will also host a movie series over the summer. Live music will return to the city on Saturday at Sidney Myer Music Bowl when almost 4000 revellers dance to an all-Australian line-up. Tickets for that sold out in fewer than three minutes. The Melbourne Cup will host 10,000 attendees next Tuesday, and the Moulin Rouge musical has announced it will hold its long-awaited Australian opening night in Melbourne on November 12 . Melbourne Zoo director Michelle Bruggeman said the primates and the carnivores would relish the fresh wave of human interaction - as would the zoo’s staff, the majority of whom worked through lockdown in the empty zoo. Melbourne Zoo director Michelle Bruggeman said there were new animals at all three Victorian zoos. Credit: Eddie Jim “[For] a lot of our staff it’s business as usual. There’s still grounds to maintain, animals to feed and lots of health issues for animals that we always manage and maintain. Having visitors, the kids and the delight of the animals is just that extra bit special,” she said. Some positive stories have emerged during the coronavirus pandemic. Melbourne Zoo’s breeding program for the grassland earless dragon, believed to be extinct in the wild in Victoria for over 10 years, has progressed successfully. Three Tasmanian devils were born at Healesville Sanctuary in recent months, as well as an oryx and a zebra at Werribee Zoo. “And here at Melbourne, our little babies are starting to grow up. The otters are as playful as ever and the snow leopards too,” Ms Bruggeman said. Tara Softley and Sharni Wood have five kids between them and were the first visitors through the zoo’s Parkville gates on Tuesday morning. Tara Softley, Sharni Wood have five kids between them, including three-year-old Lola and her unicorn dress.

While it’s been a strange 18 months, Ms Bruggeman reluctantly confirmed we’re not quite there yet. “We’ve got 5000 animals but no unicorns.”","","smh"
"Pressure mounts for ban on real guns in Hollywood after Baldwin set tragedy","https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/movies/pressure-mounts-ban-real-gun-hollywood-after-baldwin-film-set-tragedy","","['Reuters']","","'Hollywood: It’s time to create 'Halyna's Law,' which will ban the use of real firearms on film production sets,' says film director Olivia Wilde","The fatal shooting accident on the set of an Alec Baldwin movie has prompted calls for a ban on the use of real guns in TV shows and movies, with two producers already saying they will stop the practice. Booksmart film director Olivia Wilde called on Hollywood to implement what she called “Halyna’s Law,” and a petition urging Baldwin to take the lead in a campaign to ban the use of real firearms had attracted more than 27,000 votes by Monday, October 25. The campaign was prompted by the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and the wounding of director Joel Souza on the set of the Western indie movie Rust at Bonanza Creek ranch near Santa Fe last week. The two were hit when a revolver containing live rounds that was being used by Baldwin in a rehearsal discharged. Baldwin had been told the gun was not loaded, according to authorities. California state Senator Dave Cortese said he would introduce legislation intended to ban live ammunition and firearms capable of firing live ammunition from movie and TV sets in the state. “Those working behind the scenes to entertain and bring joy to millions all over the world shouldn’t go to set worrying if they will return home safely to their family,” Cortese said in a statement. Any eventual law would not apply to productions in other U.S. states or abroad. Walt Disney Co, Warner Bros, Netflix Inc and NBC television did not respond on Monday to requests for comment on their gun policies going forward. The tragedy has raised questions about safety on the set. Souza and cameraman Reid Russel told the Santa Fe Sheriff’s Department that six camera operators had walked out earlier in the day, according to court documents. No one has been charged and police are still investigating how the prop gun came to be loaded with live rounds. Prop guns are often real guns that are used on sets for the realistic visual effect of the flash and recoil after an actor pulls the trigger. They usually contain blank cartridges, which lack a bullet but use gunpowder, and can be fatal at close range. “Hollywood: It’s time to create ‘Halyna’s Law,’ which will ban the use of real firearms on film production sets and create a safe working environment for everyone involved,” Wilde tweeted on Sunday, October 24. She urged people to sign a change.org petition started by independent U.S. filmmaker Bandar Albuliwi after the accident. “Real guns are no longer needed on film production sets,” Albuliwi wrote. “Please sign this petition and demand for Alec Baldwin to use his power and influence in the Hollywood film industry to make change and ban real guns on film sets.” Baldwin on Monday declined to comment on the petition. The producers of the ABC police television series The Rookie last week were among the first to announce that there would be no more “live” weapons on the show and that air guns and computer-generated effects would be used instead. Eric Kripke, the executive producer of Amazon’s satirical superhero TV series The Boys tweeted “no more guns with blanks on any of my sets ever. We’ll use VFX muzzle flashes.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Way up in the Oakland Hills, Gary Payton is hollering good-naturedly as if he's still on the court during his days as a dynamic point guard with the Seattle SuperSonics, this time instructing his Lincoln University assistant coaches exactly where to stand for a group photo and moving them into position just so. ""Coach, the other way,"" he orders Lester Conner on his right, adjusting him by the shoulders before looking to CJ Ashford on his left and commanding, ""You turn this way."" Payton even throws both hands up almost as if ""The Glove"" is playing his signature smothering, lockdown defense again. ""Same ol' Gary,"" Ashford said. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM The 53-year-old Payton is the new men’s basketball coach at Lincoln, which has launched collegiate athletics for the first time in its 101-year history, and he is determined to make a lasting impression on the young players at the small school in his hometown of Oakland. There’s guard Jairren Lillard, the younger brother of Portland Trail Blazers star Damian Lillard. And another guard named Isaiah Attles, the grandson of Golden State Warriors Hall of Famer Al Attles. Payton's son, Julian, too. ""His presence is strongly felt in any room he steps in,"" the younger Lillard said. ""With him stepping in the room with us young men and having to take that on, it’s different, because a lot of us came from a program where we weren’t really coached. They threw a ball out to you and just said ‘play ball.’ With him, there’s going to be structure. He’s going teach you not only on the court how to be a man but off the court how to be a man, and he’s just a good role model for all of us to have in our life at this time."" They are here for an opportunity to leave a mark on basketball-crazed Oakland with a leader in Payton who knows how much his mere presence guiding this team could mean to a city that has seen two professional franchises leave recently and another exploring its options to depart. The Warriors relocated to San Francisco, the Raiders from Oakland to Las Vegas and the Athletics are pursuing possibilities in Las Vegas if they can't build a new ballpark here. ""It's the only reason I took this job, is that I can bring something back to Oakland, California,"" said Payton, who wrapped up his Hall of Fame NBA career in 2007. ""And I can bring a lot of players from this Bay Area and let them see that we've still got a lot of basketball players that's good around here. These young kids, they don't know how to play basketball right now but they will get it."" Most are upperclassmen transfers seeking a fresh start with a handful of freshmen. Isaiah Attles already played at Contra Costa College and Alcorn State. ""The support we have from Gary and our other coaches and having the support from Oakland as it is being able to go to school out here and not have to go somewhere further that's out of the Bay Area, it's just a blessing,"" Attles said. ""Couldn't ask for anything more. We're in a good position to succeed. It's all on us now."" Lincoln is located downtown but the Oaklanders practice in a gym at Merritt College and will play home games at the Warriors' former home arena. The team is an independent without a conference or NCAA affiliation, playing mostly Division II opponents during the initial season. ""It's another opportunity for kids in Oakland,"" said Warriors guard Juan Toscano-Anderson, who grew up in the city. ""Obviously, Gary is a Hall of Famer, Oakland legend and I think the kids will respect that. Everybody in the basketball community in Oakland admires Gary. He knows what he's talking about, he knows what he's doing, so I'm excited to see what happens up there. It's just another opportunity for kids in Oakland to follow their dreams. If it's not with basketball, opportunities in the classroom around the game. Hopefully, it goes well."" Golden State coach Steve Kerr can't wait to follow how Payton does. ""We have such a deeply rooted connection with Oakland, so I think that’s cool that Gary is there coaching and that the great tradition of Oakland basketball kind of continues and carries on with him leading his own team and also with those Warrior connections,"" Kerr said. ""That’s exciting. I’m going to have to check it out."" Payton is counting on a packed house when Lincoln plays at Seattle Pacific on Saturday. The team opens Wednesday at Western Washington then faces Central Washington two days later. No matter the early results, Payton's players will be disciplined. He figures if he can build fundamentally sound athletes committed to learning and making big strides, the program will gain steam and grow. And, he hopes, eventually attract not only top recruits but nationally ranked opponents. ""Well, I’m not going to tell you about the way I’m going about it, but it's kind of tough,"" Payton said with a big grin and chuckle. ""And my kids are understanding. I’ve got a good group of kids. They know I’m a no-nonsense coach, I don’t take that. I don’t take all the craziness. I’m very strict, and once you put it into them and they buy in, they have to buy into what’s going on, and when they buy in they get the results.""","https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/10/Gary-Payton.jpg","foxnews"

"All Time Low Call Abuse Allegations ‘Completely and Utterly False’","https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/all-time-low-deny-jack-barakat-sexual-abuse-allegations-1247880/","['Music', 'Music News', 'All Time Low', 'sexual abuse', 'sexual assault']","['Althea Legaspi']","","Band denies recent sexual abuse allegations against Jack Barakat made by women who claimed they were minors at the time","","2021-10-26 00:42:09","All Time Low have denied abuse allegations that have recently been made online, including on TikTok, which allege guitarist Jack Barakat had sexually abused them when they were minors. “The allegations being brought against us are absolutely and unequivocally false,” the band wrote in a statement signed by all four members on Monday. “When a TikTok video gained traction a few weeks ago alluding to inappropriate behavior within our camp, we chose not to respond because of the glaring inconsistencies in the story and the apparent reluctance to mention us by name. “We felt that a response would have elevated and escalated an outright lie and in doing so robbed actual victims of abuse of their very real and very important collective voice. We believe victims. We stand with victims. We have only ever wanted to cultivate and nurture a culture around our show and band that is welcoming, healthy, and safe.” The TikTok video the band appears to be referring to was posted earlier this month by a woman who claimed a famous pop-punk band invited her on to their tour bus when she was 13. She did not mention the band by name, but alluded to the band she was referencing in the comments. On Monday, prior to the group’s statement, an anonymous female accused Barakat of sexual assault while she was a minor beginning when she was age 15 in 2011. She alleged the abuse continued over the course of the band’s 2011 tour and during subsequent tours and events. In 2016, she alleged one of his bandmates was a witness to her being sexually assaulted by Barakat. She claimed the last occurrence was when she was 21-years old. The accuser said she had tried to share her story twice previously, but was “met with influxes of hatred from the masses” and that she was “threatened with legal action.” She added that now with the #MeToo movement, she decided to share it again. Her Twitter story and account have since been suspended, but it was screenshot in a Twitter thread before it was taken down. “I now realize that I was being manipulated by a man who groomed me during a time when I was an emotionally vulnerable child,” she wrote. The incidents which sometimes involved drugs, she said, led to an eating disorder, and several suicide attempts, and other mental anguish. “If you’ve had any experience even remotely similar to what I and others have had, I encourage you to find the courage to speak about this,” she concluded. “It’s not an easy thing to talk about but it is a story that needs to be shared.” In the band’s statement, they called the allegations “completely and utterly false. We are investigating further the source of these false accusations, and will be seeking legal recourse as we take these allegations very seriously,” they wrote. “With that in mind, we want to say again, we stand with victims and always wish to amplify the voices and stories of those who have suffered abuse and trauma. But we cannot and will not fuel or amplify lies that only cloud and distort the true stories of those who need to be heard and represented.” A statement from the four of us. pic.twitter.com/tazxZAKOkr — All Time Low (@AllTimeLow) October 25, 2021","","rollingstone"
"‘The Blacklist’: Dembe Was Originally Supposed to Appear in Only One Episode","https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/the-blacklist-dembe-originally-supposed-appear-one-episode.html/","['The Blacklist']","['Erica Scassellati']","","Hisham Tawfiq joined the cast of 'The Blacklist' as Dembe in season 1. Tawfiq returns for season 9, but originally his character was only supposed to be in one episode.","It would be hard to imagine The Blacklist without Raymond Reddington’s right-hand man, Dembe Zuma. Hisham Tawfiq joined the cast of The Blacklist as Dembe for season 1. Now, The Blacklist Season 9 is airing on NBC, and Dembe is still an important character on the show. However, the original plan was not for Tawfiq to stay on the show for multiple seasons. Hisham Tawfiq as Dembe in ‘The Blacklist’ | Will Hart/NBC Hisham Tawfiq plays Dembe on ‘The Blacklist’ The Blacklist Season 1 introduced Dembe to the world. Tawfiq’s character is brought on as Reddington’s driver and security detail. Dembe is a man of few words and a former freedom fighter from South Sudan. He is extremely loyal to Reddington, who rescued him from the world of human trafficking when he was a child. Share all your current thoughts on #TheBlacklist with us. pic.twitter.com/6oOM6mz3N2— The Blacklist (@NBCBlacklist) June 17, 2021 Dembe was able to get a college education and become fluent in multiple languages. Although he is very loyal to Reddington, Dembe isn’t afraid to call him out. In The Blacklist Season 9, Dembe joins the FBI following Liz Keen’s death. He suffers third-degree burns in the first episode of season 9. ‘The Blacklist’ didn’t plan on Dembe being a regular character Tawfiq gained quite a bit of life experience before his acting career really took off. He served as a U.S. Marine and was deployed during Operation Desert Storm. Tawfiq also worked as a corrections officer and served as a firefighter for 20 years. Tawfiq’s introduction to the performing arts is an interesting story. “I went to high school, played football, had dreams of going to the NFL, had too many injuries. As a dare I took an African dance class,” he told PIX11 News. “I fell in love with dance. I fell in love with theater. So I traveled around with a dance company, and then that transitioned into theater.” Eventually, Tawfiq landed roles on Law and Order and later The Blacklist. Interestingly, The Blacklist did not originally intend for Dembe to be a regular character on the show. “I came on to do one episode. They asked me to stay for two episodes and that went to six months to a full year,” Tawfiq said. “And 8 or going on 9 years late I’m still here so it’s truly a blessing.” Dembe became a fan favorite character If Dembe had only been limited to one episode, fans would have missed out on the development of an amazing character. In fact, besides James Spader’s Reddington, it seems like Tawfiq’s Dembe is many fans’ favorite character. We don't even know what to think anymore. What are your theories on #TheBlacklist? pic.twitter.com/21GRGRN7n1— The Blacklist (@NBCBlacklist) June 23, 2021 “Dembe, without a doubt is the best character after our Red, IMO. And as a major plus, he holds the keys to unlock much information,” a fan commented on Reddit. The discussion thread also featured a poll where users could vote on their favorite characters from The Blacklist from a list of six characters, not including Reddington. Dembe won the poll in a landslide.

Starting Tuesday, the comment sections on the department's Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube pages will be disabled, though private message inboxes will remain open, the agency wrote in a social media post . The department said the move aimed at preventing the circulation of false information ""will be applied to all posts, and not be specific to any particular topic."" Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the comment sections of the agency's Facebook posts have served as an unchecked battleground for North Dakotans arguing about the disease, and later, the vaccine developed to mitigate it. The department's posts about COVID-19 and inoculations have often generated hundreds of comments, including many that promote misleading, debunked or outright fraudulent information. Just a few hours before the department's announcement, a Facebook user falsely claimed in the comment section of a post about COVID-19 that the mRNA spike proteins in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines destroy the human immune system. On a post last week, one user appended a video of an anti-vaccination commentator misinterpreting federal data about deaths following COVID-19 vaccinations , while earlier in the day, another user erroneously called the vaccine a “bioweapon” that injects HIV into the bloodstream. North Dakota has one of the lowest COVID-19 vaccination rates in the country, and health officials in the state have for months blamed the spread of misinformation and ""fake news"" on social media as one of the primary causes of vaccine skepticism. Facebook and other social media outlets have come under fire from health experts and some mostly liberal politicians who say the platforms fail to suppress vaccine-related misinformation, though many conservative politicians and commentators have argued the websites shouldn't censor content. Followers of the department's Facebook page were similarly divided Monday: some applauded the decision to eliminate comments, while others accused the agency of silencing dissenters to pro-vaccine messaging.","https://www.fccnn.com/incoming/7254012-ku6rue-Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-6.19.29-PM.png/alternates/BASE_LANDSCAPE/Screen%20Shot%202021-10-25%20at%206.19.29%20PM.png","inforum"

The post Yes, Claw Clips Are Back, Here’s How to Relive the ’90s Hair Craze appeared first on Lifehacker Australia.","If your ’90s loving heart was set aflutter when scrunchies made a comeback, you’ll die over the latest trend making a resurgence. Recently, a bunch of achingly cool, off-duty models and influencers have been filling my Instagram feed sporting a range of claw hair clips. Yep, those toothy clips you were obsessed with in primary school have quickly become the epitome of effortless, it-girl style — and this Editor’s go-to on a bad hair day. They’re also a great solution to hair bands, especially if you’re trying to look after damaged hair. They’re snagless, won’t get tangled up in your ends and won’t give your a migraine from long-term use. My only gripe with trends like these is that once big brands see the likes of Bella Hadid and Hailey Bieber wearing claw clips, they immediately bring out a wildly expensive range of them. My cheeky hack: picking up cheap multipacks on Amazon for under $25. You can find a range of pastel clips, tortoiseshell ones, sleek metallic style clips and a bunch of different shaped claws, that will cost you a quarter of the price and come with backups, you know in case one snaps — we’ve all felt that pain. Below, I’ve graciously shared my favourite claw hair clips from Amazon that won’t break the bank so you can try the trend. You’re welcome!

The Houston furniture store owner known as “Mattress Mack” has a total of $3.35 million riding at four different sportsbooks to win $35.6 million on the Astros to win the World Series. With Atlanta a +120 underdog to Houston (-140), Mack could easily hedge his bets to ensure a profit. For example, he could wager $5 million to win $6 million on the Braves to lock in winnings of either $2.65 million if Atlanta wins or $30.6 million if the Astros prevail. But the Texas native said he would never bet against his hometown team. “That would be like betting against one of my own children,” said McIngvale, 70. “I will never in my life bet against the Houston Astros. If I have one good quality, it’s loyalty. And I’m loyal to the Houston Astros.” Mack placed the bets in June: $2 million to make $20 million (10-1) at Caesars Sportsbook; $1 million to make $10 million (10-1) at FanDuel Sportsbook; $250,000 to make $4 million (16-1) at DraftKings Sportsbook; and $100,000 to make $1.6 million (16-1) at The Score sportsbook. After the Astros won the American League pennant Friday over the Boston Red Sox, Mack inquired about cash-out options at FanDuel and Caesars. “FanDuel told me they’d cash it out for $5.5 million. Caesars said they don’t do cash-outs,” he said. “I would never cash out because I’m a Houston Astros believer. But I just wanted to see what it was.” Between the hedges Mack’s wagers on the Astros are hedge bets themselves to offset potential losses of about $25 million and counting from a promotion that offers his Gallery Furniture customers a refund of any purchase of $3,000 or more if Houston wins the World Series. “Saturday was the biggest day in the history of this store and Sunday outdid Saturday by $600,000,” Mack told the Review-Journal on Monday. “We sold thousands of mattresses. Over the weekend, we probably did $10 million in sales. “I had people who have been in the furniture business for 40 years and their mouths just dropped. They couldn’t believe all the people in here. It was unbelievable.” Mack said his wife, Linda McIngvale, has had enough of the frenzy. “She’s up there nervously adding up all the tickets and telling me to stop the promotion,” he said. “I said I’m going on until the end of the day and more than likely, it will stop (Monday night). Unless I do something crazy in the middle of the night and decide to extend it. “The problem is we’ve got so many deliveries, we can’t hardly make them all.” ‘Great karma’ Besides Caesars, every Las Vegas sportsbook will win money on the Astros. “We got lucky that the Giants and Dodgers both got knocked out,” MGM Resorts director of trading Jeff Stoneback said. “Fortunately, we didn’t take any Mattress Mack money. So we’re good with the Astros.” If Caesars does end up paying out $20 million to McIngvale, vice president of trading Craig Mucklow said he’s glad it will be to a philanthopist who has opened his stores several times as a shelter for flood and hurricane victims. “The guy has got great karma. He’s done a lot for that community,” Mucklow said. “If somebody is going to win, you can’t complain about it being him. He’s stellar.” If the Astros claim their second World Series title in five years and Mack wins $35.6 million, he said he’ll host several parties to give customers their money back. “Giving away the money, that would be a lot of fun,” he said. “Especially since it will be fully funded by my friends at Caesars, DraftKings, FanDuel and Score, should it all happen.” Contact reporter Todd Dewey at tdewey@reviewjournal.com.

In 2019 that team was the Nationals, who emerged from the National League wild-card round and methodically knocked off the Dodgers, Cardinals and Astros to win the World Series. This year it’s the Braves — whose 88 victories were the fewest of any club to reach the postseason — proudly wearing the underdog crown, as they prepare to face an Astros team that has reached the World Series for the third time in five seasons, which included a 2017 world championship. The Post’s Mike Puma breaks down the matchup between the NL East and AL West champions as Tuesday’s Game 1 approaches: Eddie Rosario was named MVP of the NLCS after tying a MLB postseason series record with 14 hits. The former Indians outfielder joins Freddie Freeman, Ozzie Albies and Austin Riley to give the Braves a formidable top four. For as much power as Freeman possesses, his .393 on-base percentage is also impressive. Jose Altuve is still a presence atop the lineup for the Astros, who have Michael Brantley and Alex Bregman behind him. Nobody was better at getting on base during the ALCS than Yordan Alvarez, who was named MVP of the series after reaching base at a .535 clip. During the regular season, the Astros led MLB with a .340 on-base percentage. Edge: Astros The Braves had four players (Riley, Freeman, Albies and Dansby Swanson who topped 25 homers this season). Riley emerged as an MVP candidate after hitting 33 homers, but the veteran Freeman, who came on strong in the NLCS after a slow start, still has to be considered the most feared hitter in Atlanta’s lineup. Jorge Soler, Joc Pederson and Adam Duvall are power bats the Braves acquired at the trade deadline. There are plenty of big bats in the Astros’ lineup, starting with Alvarez, who blasted 33 homers during the regular season. Altuve (31 homers) and Kyle Tucker (30) were right behind him. Carlos Correa and Yuli Gurriel have pop and even light-hitting catcher Martin Maldanado hit 12 homers. Edge: Braves Albies was 20-for-24 in stolen-base attempts during the regular season, giving the Braves a presence on the bases. He also swiped two bases against the Dodgers in the NLCS. Swanson stole nine bases during the regular season. Tucker was 14-for-16 in stolen base attempts during the regular season for the Astros. Edge: Braves Freeman, Albies and Swanson are all above average defensively, but Riley is shaky at third base, ranking in only the fifth percentile for outs above average among players at the position this season, according to baseball savant. The Astros have a premier double-play combination in Correa and Altuve. At the corner-infield spots, Bregman and Gurriel bring passable gloves. Edge: Astros Duvall is a standout in center field, but Rosario and Pederson on the corners are below average. Guillermo Heredia serves as a strong late-inning defensive replacement for the Braves in the outfield, moving Duvall to right. Chas McCormick brings an exceptional glove and speed to center field for the Astros. Kyle Tucker is well above average as a right fielder, but Michael Brantley is stationary in left. Edge: Astros Soler and Heredia are the two big bench options for the Braves, but one can start in Houston, where the DH will be in use. Johan Camargo and Orlando Arcia are also depth options. Jason Castro is the Astros’ best option off the bench — he was 2-for-3 with a homer against the Red Sox in the ALCS. Edge: Braves Left-hander Max Fried was the Braves ace during the regular season and pitched the best among the team’s starters in the NLCS. The Braves also have Charlie Morton, who won a World Series title with the Astros, and Ian Anderson, who allowed only one run in his start Saturday in the NLCS clincher. The Astros have a solid group in Framber Valdez, Luis Garcia and Zack Greinke. The best of the group during the regular season was Valdez, who pitched to a 3.14 ERA in 22 starts. Greinke owns World Series experience from 2019. Edge : Even Tyler Matzek has pitched to a 2.00 ERA with 17 strikeouts in 10 ¹/₃ innings this postseason. The left-hander had his best showing in Game 6 of the NLCS against the Dodgers, when he struck out the side after entering with two runners on base in a two-run game. A.J. Minter, Jesse Chavez and Chris Martin are among the other important pieces leading into closer Will Smith. The Astros have big arms in Ryan Pressly (who saved 26 games during the regular season), Cristian Javier, Brooks Raley, Kendall Graveman and Phil Maton, among others. Edge: Braves Brian Snitker took the Braves to Game 7 of the NLCS last season and finally broke through this year. He brings an old-school touch, with plenty of analytics behind him. Dusty Baker had a Hall of Fame résumé even before this postseason, but his legacy has been burnished by the Astros’ success this season. Baker was last seen in the World Series managing the 2002 Giants, who lost to the Angels. Edge: Astros The Braves are 5-0 at Truist Park this postseason, playing before a fan base now ecstatic over the franchise’s first World Series appearance since 1999. But are the Braves just happy to be here, after exorcising the demons from last year’s NLCS collapse? The nucleus of the Astros’ tainted 2017 World Series championship team remains intact, with players such as Altuve, Correa and Bregman still on board. Does this crew have something to prove, mainly that it can win (presumably) without cheating?
