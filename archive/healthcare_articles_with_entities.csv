Quips about putting radio on the internet aside, the persistent popularity of podcasting and the cockamamie climb of Clubhouse shows that audio-based platforms will continue to echo around the upper echelons of the ecosystem for a while yet. Joining the fray is Heart to Heart, an audio-first dating app aiming to bring back some intimacy to the process of finding the right person for your next foray, whether that’s a saucy encounter or a mate for life. “I used to act, and from my time in acting, I saw how much voice, and audio experiences drive intimacy between people,” explains Joshua Ogundu, co-founder and CEO of Heart to Heart. “When it came down to the dating apps, it was never something I could get into. I felt like you needed to come up with a textual one-liner. That was never my way of approaching romantic conversations.” Heart to Heart is pushing back against the endless swiping and messaging of many of its competitors, offering a contrasting experience to sending the same opening line to dozens of people or typing with your thumbs until deep into the night. “I believe that the best consumer investments come from people who have unique insights on consumer behavior and ways that new tech products can allow new forms of social interaction,” said Charles Hudson from Precursor Ventures, who led the pre-seed investment round. “I have been a big fan of Josh’s TikTok videos for some time and his ability to poke at the tech industry with timely, relevant videos really showcased his creativity and ability to communicate via short-form video. I think the idea around confirming photos, storytelling, and audio will yield a product that really speaks to people’s unmet needs around communication and will create a whole new way for people to connect.” While Precursor doesn’t particularly focus on audio-first startups, the team has seen a number of opportunities in that space. It was an early investor in Howard Akumiah’s company, Betty Labs (acquired by Spotify), as well as Isa Watson’s company (Squad), Falon Fatemi’s company (Fireside) and several others that are still in stealth. “I believe that there is a major wave of interesting activity happening around non-music audio and I believe that we are still in the early innings of non-music, audio-driven social experiences,” says Hudson. “The last two companies that I feel really innovated in this category were Tinder and Bumble. I think Josh and his team have a new mechanic that feels differentiated and unique and I think it has the potential to be the foundation for a new way for people to meet and get to know each other in ways that aren’t easily accomplished today.” Joshua Ogundu, co-founder and CEO of Heart to Heart (Photo provided by Heart to Heart) The company raised the pre-seed round of $750,000. The round was led by Precursor Ventures, and Bryce Roberts of OATV & Angelica Nwandu of The Shade Room partnered on the investment, as well as Marie Rocha at Realist Ventures. In addition, a number of angel investors joined the round, including Chris Bennett (Wonderschool), Andy Weissman (USV) and Gregory Levey (Robinson Huntly). “The main thing we are trying to accomplish with the $750K, is to focus on building our iOS app, and making LA our first launch market,” says Ogundu. “Dating is such a local experience, and it makes sense to us to build and improve locally, then scaling it up from there.” “Voice is so intentional and intimate, and that is exactly what we’re building here at Heart to Heart,” says Ogundu, suggesting that the voice mechanic is helpful in a dating context because it helps slow people down. “I think that because it takes more energy to send that voice snippet to someone, you’ll be more intentional with who you even look to strike up conversations with.” The founding team consists of Joshua Ogundu, who wears the CEO hat. He is joined by Arihant Jain and Komal Shrivastava, who have been heading up the engineering and design efforts. The company hopes to get its product to market by the end of the year.",2021-10-25 18:30:46,,,techcrunch,True,"[('Radio', 'ORG'), ('Clubhouse', 'ORG'), ('Joshua Ogundu', 'PERSON'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('dozens', 'CARDINAL'), ('the night', 'TIME'), ('Charles Hudson', 'PERSON'), ('Precursor Ventures', 'ORG'), ('Josh’s', 'ORG'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('Howard Akumiah’s', 'PERSON'), ('Betty Labs', 'PERSON'), ('Spotify', 'ORG'), ('Isa Watson’s', 'ORG'), ('Falon Fatemi’s', 'PERSON'), ('Hudson', 'PERSON'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('Tinder and Bumble', 'ORG'), ('Josh', 'PERSON'), ('today', 'DATE'), ('Joshua Ogundu', 'PERSON'), ('750,000', 'MONEY'), ('Precursor Ventures', 'ORG'), ('Bryce Roberts', 'PERSON'), ('OATV & Angelica Nwandu of The Shade Room', 'ORG'), ('Marie Rocha', 'PERSON'), ('Realist Ventures', 'ORG'), ('Chris Bennett', 'PERSON'), ('Andy Weissman', 'PERSON'), ('USV', 'ORG'), ('Gregory Levey', 'PERSON'), ('$750K', 'MONEY'), ('LA', 'GPE'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('Ogundu', 'PERSON'), ('Ogundu', 'PERSON'), ('Joshua Ogundu', 'PERSON'), ('Komal Shrivastava', 'PERSON'), ('the end of the year', 'DATE')]"

An interim analysis from a mid-to-late stage clinical trial of 4,753 children showed that two doses of vaccine produced a high level of neutralizing antibodies – Y-shaped proteins that bind to the coronavirus and block it from entering human cells. The vaccine was dosed at 50 micrograms, which is half of what is used among adults, but still produced on average 1.5 times as many antibodies in children as it did in young adults given the higher dose. The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate, including fatigue, headache, fever, and injection site pain.

A briefing document posted on the FDA’s website indicated the agency believes benefits outweigh the most worrying side effect for this age group, namely myocarditis, or heart inflammation. “The overall analysis predicted that the numbers of clinically significant COVID-19-related outcomes prevented would clearly outweigh the numbers of vaccine-associated excess myocarditis cases,” the document said. But it acknowledged the benefit-risk calculus would differ when community transmission is very low, as was the case in the United States in June 2021. The FDA also uploaded Pfizer’s efficacy analysis, with the company estimating a two-dose course of its vaccine at 10 micrograms was more than 90 percent effective in preventing symptomatic disease. Overall, more than 150 children aged 5 to 11 have died from Covid in the United States since the start of the pandemic, according to official data. “If all goes well, and we get the regulatory approval and the recommendation from the CDC, it’s entirely possible, if not very likely, that vaccines will be available for children from 5 to 11 within the first week or two of November,” Fauci told ABC News Sunday.

What causes ADHD and can it be cured?,https://theconversation.com/what-causes-adhd-and-can-it-be-cured-170179,,"['Gregory Fabiano', ' Professor of Psychology', ' Florida International University']",,,"On average, two students in every U.S. classroom have ADHD. damircudic/E+ via Getty Images Curious Kids is a series for children of all ages. If you have a question you’d like an expert to answer, send it to curiouskidsus@theconversation.com. What causes ADHD and can it be cured? – Geneva B., age 17, Philippines Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder is a common, yet often misunderstood, mental health condition. Symptoms include inattention, overactivity and impulsivity – behaviors everyone experiences at one time or another. For people with ADHD, these behaviors happen frequently and interfere with everyday life at school, at home and everywhere else. ADHD affects more than 6 million U.S. children. People who have ADHD develop symptoms by age 12, and it usually continues into adolescence and young adulthood. The condition can affect people throughout their whole life. On average, two students in every U.S. classroom have it. It is important to note that ADHD is just one way of defining a person’s behavior. It has nothing to do with how smart you are or whether you can make friends or excel at sports, music or art, or about any other strengths. What does and doesn’t cause ADHD Nobody really knows exactly what causes ADHD. Scientists think that genes may play a role, but no one knows exactly how at this point. Based on years of research findings, scientists attribute this condition to a combination of how someone’s brain works and their personal environment. Research has cast more light on what does not cause ADHD. For example, findings do not support the widespread theories that excessive sugar or too much time on electronics are responsible for growth in the number of children diagnosed with the condition since 1990 – when it was detected in less than 2% of all U.S. children. Today, at least 9.4% of kids have this diagnosis. Based on all the research I’ve conducted and the other findings I’ve reviewed, I think this increase is caused by better identification and more awareness of ADHD in general, rather than an overall increase in ADHD. How parents interact with their child, likewise, does not cause ADHD. But children and adolescents with ADHD have many behaviors that require more parental involvement than their peers. Changing behaviors as therapy Most psychologists think about ADHD as a characteristic that, like eye color or height, can’t be changed. Doctors can’t cure ADHD, just like they can’t double the length of your legs. If someone had a hard time reaching a high shelf, would you tell them they just need to be taller? Of course not. But you could suggest they use a stepladder. The good news is there are ways that people with ADHD can overcome the challenges this condition brings. Evidence supports two distinct kinds of treatments. Behavioral therapy is typically implemented by parents and teachers working together. It includes setting clear goals and giving feedback on progress toward those goals, usually on a daily basis. Another feature is providing rewards or privileges when people with ADHD meet their goals. Among the most effective treatments is teaching parents how to pay more attention when their children do their schoolwork and chores and generally behave well. Parents and teachers can help kids by “catching them being good” – rather than through correction and punishment. As they get older, children and teens with ADHD can set goals for themselves and work hard to learn ways to keep organized and manage their day. Behavioral therapy makes a difference because ADHD works like a light operated by a dimmer switch. Rather than simply being turned on or off, it can be turned up to a bright level or dialed down to a faint glimmer. ADHD symptoms, similarly, can increase or decrease in response to particular situations and interactions. Medications can help Prescription stimulant drugs, such as Adderall and Ritalin, can help many people with ADHD focus longer. Like with all medications, however, some people can’t take them due to side effects. Some nonstimulant drugs are available, but they generally are less effective. Researchers have found that the best approach is when behavior therapy begins first, especially for young children with ADHD. ADHD can hinder big transitions. In childhood and young adulthood, that includes starting middle school or high school, learning to drive, going to college or entering the workforce. I believe that extra attention and treatment are usually required at those times. Many years of research have led me to believe people with ADHD can be successful in the long run when they, their families and their teachers work as hard as is necessary to build skills and change behavior patterns that complicate everyday life. It also helps when they get that support for as long as is needed. Hello, curious kids! Do you have a question you’d like an expert to answer?

According to the experts, smokers who are unable to quit smoking should consider heated tobacco products that do not involve the burning of tobacco. The experts made the call at a media briefing organised by Philip Morris International and held at Radisson Blu, Ikeja, Lagos on Saturday. Speaking at the media briefing, the head of Scientific Engagement, the Middle East and Africa region, Philip Morris International, Ignacho Gonzalez, who is a medical researcher, stated that the tobacco company is committed to encouraging safer alternatives to tobacco smoking. The company, Gonzalez said, is poised to introduce smoke-free products that would be be better alternatives for smokers who have been unable to quit smoking despite their best efforts. The media briefing had in attendance Director External Affairs sub-Saharan Africa PMI, Haruna Ly, Director External Affairs PMI, Nigeria, Mojisola Akpata, Manager of Communications of the region, PMI, Ms. Cecil, CEO Almack Media, Aliu Akoshile and Executive Chairman of All Africa Global Media, Amadou Mahtar Ba. Gonzalez, speaking virtually at the event noted that wh quitting smoking still remains the best choice for health. He, however, stressed that the PMI tobacco-heated products are better alternatives for people who are unable to quit smoking. “Our ambition and intent are to convince smokers who intend to continue smoking to switch to smoke-free products as soon as possible. “We want to move away from cigarettes as soon as possible. We want cigarettes to be obsolete, something of the past and we are doing everything that we can to get to the day where there are no more cigarettes as soon as possible.” According to the World Health Organisation, there are one billion smokers in the world. Gonzalez noted that despite efforts by governments and regulators to reduce the number of smokers by advocating the prevention and cessation of smoking cigarettes, the numbers still remain. According to Gonzalez, switching to heated tobacco products eliminates the combustion which tobacco passes through that causes danger in the health of smokers. He stated that discussions around tobacco should be steered towards harm reduction instead. “The government and regulators have tried to reduce the number of smokers by prevention and cessation. These measures have had success but still, there are one billion smokers out there so the question is what else can we do. “This is where the area of tobacco harm reduction as a third complementary pillar to the other two comes to play,” he said. Gonzalez noted that though switching to heated tobacco products does not completely eliminate the risks involved in smoking, they significantly reduce it. This, he said, is backed by evidence from 10 clinical studies conducted by PMI in different parts of the world. “When you look at these alternatives under the umbrella of harm reduction, if we want to achieve harm reduction, we need to think. “On one hand we need products that are less harmful than continuing to smoke and this needs to be demonstrated by the scientific side and at the same time we need products that are accepted by smokers so that they can switch because at the end of the day if you have a product that has great risk reduction but nobody uses it, you will not achieve harm reduction.” He added that in heated tobacco products, nicotine, a reason why many smokers still smoke, is present. He quashed the notion that nicotine is the primary cause of diseases from smoking. He posited that while nicotine is not risk-free, it is not the primary cause of diseases in smokers. “The primary cause of disease in a cigarette is actually the toxicants that are present in the smoke of a cigarette, the majority of which are generated when the tobacco burns,” he said. Also speaking, the Director, External Affairs at PMI, Nigeria, Mojisola Akpata called on the government to encourage safer alternatives to smoking. Akpata urged the Nigerian government to practice differentiated regulation in the tobacco industry and also provide education to smokers. The director of external affairs stated that the focus of the discussion on tobacco harm should now be focused on harm reduction instead of only prevention and cessation. She urged that regulators consider the third option supported by the WHO which is harm reduction. PMI, Akpata said, is leading the innovation to healthier alternatives to cigarette smoking by creating a range of alternatives such as e-cigarettes and other products that do not involve the burning of tobacco. According to Akpata, smoke is the primary cause of smoking-related diseases hence by eliminating burning, the levels of harmful chemicals generated can be significantly reduced. The company, Akpata said, does not want non-smokers to begin smoking, rather they are investing in reducing the risks caused by the combustion of tobacco to the health of smokers who cannot quit. “Harm reduction is what has led to all the research and development that we have had in this space moving from cigarettes to alternatives that are safer.” She stated that the discussion on moving to tobacco harm reduction makes sense because “it is scientifically substantiated that smokers who switch extend their life span.” “It’s good for public health. She added that since it applies in other industries the same thing should apply to tobacco companies. “We are trying to extend our time here on earth and for us to do that, it requires that the regulatory space allows for you to have harm reduction information available to legal age smokers. “A lot of countries are taking on the harm reduction mantra. It works for public health experts to say, you know what? We encourage e-cigarette as an option because it is a safer alternative. Although not totally safe, it is a reduced risk alternative to burning tobacco and that is the conversation that we are hoping that Africa and Nigeria will have soon. “However, you need to understand what the regulatory tools are to regulate the tobacco space and in regulating the tobacco space we are looking at the principles. “We believe that nicotine and tobacco should be regulated, youths and non-smokers should not use tobacco products. “We should have the options of choosing and you can only have that if you have the awareness and if there are regulations in place. Smokers should have access to information that would allow them to make informed decisions. “Regulations need to achieve a balance. Maximize the potential of adults to switch to a better alternative.” “While these tobacco heated products are yet to hit the Nigerian market, these are widely accepted even by regulatory bodies in Europe, America, and Asia while South Africa is the only Africa where heated tobacco products are available at the moment,” Akpata, said.

Although not totally safe, it is a reduced risk alternative to burning tobacco and that is the conversation that we are hoping that Africa and Nigeria will have soon. “However, you need to understand what the regulatory tools are to regulate the tobacco space and in regulating the tobacco space we are looking at the principles. “We believe that nicotine and tobacco should be regulated, youths and non-smokers should not use tobacco products. “We should have the options of choosing and you can only have that if you have the awareness and if there are regulations in place. Smokers should have access to information that would allow them to make informed decisions. “Regulations need to achieve a balance. Maximize the potential of adults to switch to a better alternative.” “While these tobacco heated products are yet to hit the Nigerian market, these are widely accepted even by regulatory bodies in Europe, America, and Asia while South Africa is the only Africa where heated tobacco products are available at the moment,” Akpata, said.

The Director-General of WHO, Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus said this in his address at the World Health Summit on Sunday. According to him, the pandemic will end when the world chooses to end it. “Twelve years since the first World Health Summit, we meet once again in the shadow of a pandemic. And we are faced once again with some very big questions: some of the same ones we were asking in 2009 that remain unanswered, and some new ones. “One of the questions I am asked most often is: when will the pandemic end? My answer is that the pandemic will end when the world chooses to end it. It’s in our hands. We have all the tools we need: effective public health tools and effective medical tools. “But the world has not used those tools well. With almost 50 thousand deaths a week, the pandemic is far from over – and that’s just the reported deaths,” Ghebreyesus said. The WHO chief noted that the target to vaccinate 40 percent of the population of every country by the end of this year is reachable if the countries and companies that control supply match their statements with actions. “The barrier is not production. The barriers are politics and profit. It’s clear what needs to happen. The countries that have already reached the 40 percent target – including all G20 countries – must give their place in the vaccine delivery queue to COVAX and the African Vaccines Acquisition Trust, or AVAT; The G20 countries must fulfil their dose-sharing commitments immediately. “Manufacturers must prioritize and fulfil their contracts with COVAX and AVAT as a matter of urgency, and be far more transparent about what is going where. “And they must share know-how, technology, and licences, and waive intellectual property rights. We’re not asking for charity; we’re calling for a common-sense investment in the global recovery,” he said. He urged countries to end the pandemic by pulling out all the stops to reach the target of vaccinating 40 percent of the population by the end of this year. “The pandemic has demonstrated beyond doubt that health is not a luxury for the rich, or simply an outcome of development; it’s a fundamental human right, and the basis of social, economic, and political stability. “There’s only one way to achieve these three things – and that’s together. No country can end the pandemic in isolation from the rest of the world. And no country can protect the health of its own people without working to protect the health of all people. “It takes some tough negotiations and some tough decisions. But the reward is a world that is healthier, safer, and fairer for all of us,” he noted. Copyright PUNCH All rights reserved.

COVID doesn't need to run rampant. Here are 6 ways to keep cases low in the next year,https://theconversation.com/covid-doesnt-need-to-run-rampant-here-are-6-ways-to-keep-cases-low-in-the-next-year-170207,,"['Brendan Crabb', ' Director and CEO', ' Burnet Institute']",,,"In the blink of an eye, we’ve gone from 18 months of zero tolerance for COVID to accepting huge case numbers as the norm for Australia’s foreseeable future. Our ambitions are now limited to simply keeping a lid on things to avoid our health systems being overwhelmed – not that we’ve defined what that limit is. But how many lives, severe illnesses, and cases of long COVID are we willing to accept? The national and other roadmaps aren’t explicit about this. NSW and Victoria have regularly seen 10-15 lives lost each day to COVID, so this could represent the baseline rather than the cap. The impact of long COVID simply isn’t considered in the risk-benefit equation. It’s time to draw breath and consider a better alternative. High case numbers aren’t our only path to freedom. It’s not inevitable all Australians will get COVID in the near future. We could keep numbers low now and move to a strategy of eliminating the virus, like we do for measles, mumps, rubella and whooping cough, just to name a few. A strategy of local COVID elimination shouldn’t be taboo when it’s the norm for many other infectious diseases. Why do high case numbers matter if we’re all vaccinated? COVID vaccines are truly brilliant, especially against severe disease. They provide the essential base to move away from harsh public health measures. But like any medical intervention, they’re not perfect, even against severe illness. You aren’t bulletproof if you’ve had two doses. In fact, as Health Minister Greg Hunt announced last week, you’ll probably need a third dose soon. What’s more, releasing restrictions across the country is based on vaccination targets for those over 16 years. But reaching 70% and 80% targets leaves 30% or 20% of people unvaccinated and at risk in this group alone. Importantly this will include pockets of communities with much lower vaccination levels than others. Plus all children under 12 will be unvaccinated. Together, that’s 5-10 million unvaccinated Australians. Let’s be clear, the virus is and will be in our community for some time. This is sometimes inaccurately described as “endemic”, as in, a settled and predictable infection. COVID isn’t that yet, and we have no idea when it will be. COVID will remain epidemic for some time, characterised by bursts in at-risk communities and pockets of under-vaccinated people, because of waning immunity or new variants. If not countered, this epidemic scenario will continue to disrupt our health and economy. So, we need a ‘vaccines-plus’ strategy Keeping COVID numbers low presents a substantial challenge, especially in deeply fatigued NSW and Victoria. But as OzSAGE, an Australian network of scientists providing advice on COVID, has detailed, it can be achieved with a deliberate “vaccines-plus” strategy. The “plus” includes a range of minimally disruptive measures to keep transmission down, such as improving ventilation and maintaining the use of masks in higher risk settings. Victoria’s schools’ package is the best current example of appropriate ambition in this space. International examples tell us vaccines-plus works vastly better than vaccine-only. Keeping numbers low also presents a positive-feedback loop as it enables a functioning test, trace, isolate and quarantine system that’s crucial to keeping a lid on numbers. Keeping numbers low now doesn’t just delay the inevitable. In fact, a major motivation for holding the line is the future will be much better. Six ways to strengthen our COVID defences In 12 months’ time, the tools for interrupting transmission and managing COVID as a sporadic infectious disease will be substantially stronger than they are now. A realistic vision for a year from now includes: 1. Vastly improved vaccination Three shots will be routine and 80-90% of the whole population will be fully vaccinated in this way. Kids over five will also immunised, and we’ll be on the way to approving vaccines for those under five. This goal is likely to be achieved in six months rather than 12. We’ll be able to identify people who need further boosters using “immunity tests”, which provide a surrogate measure of people’s immunity. These are being developed by the Burnet and Doherty Institutes. Vaccines will prevent much more transmission than they do now. 2. Much less airborne transmission Clean air will be provided in risky indoor settings in a regulated and accepted way. Indoor density limits, and improved, targeted mask-wearing will be normalised in settings like public transport and schools. 3. New treatments Advances in therapy are likely to change the game completely. These could be simple pills or inhalers. For example, Australia recently purchased Merck’s COVID pill “molnupiravir”, which the company said halved the risk of hospitalisation and death. This is just a taster of what’s to come. Read more: Take-at-home COVID drug molnupiravir may be on its way — but vaccination is still our first line of defence 4. Improved test, trace, isolate and quarantine People who have COVID will easily and quickly know they’re positive and stay home while infectious. Our test, trace, isolate and quarantine systems will be functional and modernised, perhaps even using artificial intelligence. Self-testing, at home and elsewhere, will be widespread. 5. Traffic light quarantine system Borders will be open but risk-assessed. High-risk travellers will still have some form of quarantine. This is especially important to keep new variants at bay. 6. Reduced COVID in the region It’s really not an option for the developed world to let infections run free in low-income countries. COVID doesn’t need to run rampant Letting COVID run is a risky experiment and most countries with greater experience of the impact of COVID infections have rejected this approach. An ambitious attitude to elimination can be achieved with a vaccines-plus strategy now and embracing innovations as they inevitably come. The second-best pandemic outcome is for most Australians to be fully vaccinated before they encounter the virus for the first time. After 18 months of monumental effort, and to this country’s enduring credit, this objective will be achieved. But there’s an even more important end goal for our health, free society, and economy – for most Australians to never encounter the virus at all, or if they do, to not be infected by it. In 12 months’ time, our defence against COVID will be stronger. We need a vaccines-plus strategy to safely get us there.

Facebook claims it removes 97 per cent of hateful posts, but Ms Haugen said that was just hate that their computers found. She said one of the reasons Facebook’s bots failed to pick up hate was because they could not recognise regional dialects. Giving an example she said: “UK English is sufficiently different that I would be unsurprised if the safety systems that they developed primarily for American English were actually under-enforcing in the UK.” In an explosive hearing, she said social network is “hurting the most vulnerable among us” and leading people down “rabbit holes.” Ms Haugen also met with Ian Russell the father of Molly Russel – the 14 year-old who killed herself after watching self-harm videos on Instagram. Chillingling she told MPs: “The algorithms take people who have very mainstream interests and they push them towards extreme interests. Adding: “Someone looking for healthy recipes will get pushed towards anorexia content.” And she said bullying follows children home from school and carries on in their bedrooms at night via Instagram, a whistleblower has claimed.

The health secretary insisted the festive season will be “safe” so long as enough people get out and take their booster jabs. ReutersSajid Javid insisted Brits will enjoy a ‘normal’ Christmas[/caption] AlamyThe health sec urged people to take tests before visiting elderly relatives[/caption] He dismissed Labour’s calls for Plan B restrictions including mask wearing, working from home, and vaccine passports to be triggered now. And he called on the five millions Brits who haven’t yet had the vaccine at all to come forward this winter. Asked if he agrees with Boris Johnson that this Christmas will be much better than last year’s, he replied: “Yes, of course. “For all of those like me hoping and planning for a normal Christmas – I do think that’s where we’ll be – if you want that let’s keep playing our part.” Mr Javid said people should “be cautious and take sensible actions to try and prevent the spread of the virus” as winter closes in. In particular he urged people to start taking Lateral Flow Tests before going to visit elderly relatives. He also said Brits should wear masks in crowded public places and keep up basic hygiene practices like hand washing. No Plan B Mr Javid insisted the pandemic data doesn’t yet show that the Government needs to trigger Plan B. He said: “We are not at that point. Whether we get there or not, we will see. “But the best thing we can all do to try and prevent us moving to Plan B or taking any further measures is to get out there and get our vaccines.” The health secretary also said he is “leaning towards” making jabs mandatory for all NHS workers within weeks. His remarks came after NHS England’s top doctor urged Brits to get their booster jabs to save festive celebrations. Professor Stephen Powis said people must “take up the offer” of a third dose to “protect the freedom and Christmas that we have all earned”. Mr Javid said the booster rollout has “picked up substantially” in recent days as more and more people come forward. A record 800,000 jabs were administered during the final three days of last week, including 325,140 on Saturday alone. And the PM was also handed another major boost as scientists predicted Covid cases will plummet within weeks without the need for Plan B.

Chalo founder and chief executive Mohit Dubey said the acquisition of Shuttl, which operates thousands of buses aimed at working professionals, will help his startup gain presence in many parts of the country including metro cities, broaden the technology and product offerings, and also supercharge the the firm’s overseas expansion efforts. “Shuttl and Chalo, these are the firms that are positioned to become the largest mobility firms in the world. I wish the pandemic had not happened, but it has allowed the two companies with a similar focus to come together,” he said in an interview with TechCrunch. Dubey declined to disclose the financial terms of the deal, but said Shuttl co-founder and chief executive Amit Singh has agreed to continue his journey. Chalo will continue to use Shuttl’s branding, he said. “We started out to take the pain away from daily commuters. In the process we ended up building a category, and inspiring others from different parts of the world to do the same. It’s a bittersweet moment for us. We believe the team and legacy of Shuttl will thrive equally well in the new set-up,” said Singh in a statement. For investors of Shuttl, too, it’s a bittersweet moment. The startup had been struggling to raise a new financing round and had cut its workforce to address the pandemic. For months, murmurs around Shuttl shutting shops were floating. Shuttl had raised over $97 million in a series of financing rounds, according to data intelligence platform Tracxn. The startup counts Amazon, Times Internet, Sequoia Capital India, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and Toyota among its backers. Chalo said that the entire current team of Shuttl, including several key executives who have been part of the startup from the beginning, will continue in their roles. Dubey said he has been engaging with Shuttl’s Singh for several years, but the two began acquisition talks only two months ago. This is a developing story.

How nice. But no. Ecosia’s founders and the network around it are far more serious about climate change than that superficial assessment might suggest. Last year in March 2020, just before the world started to close down amid the Pandemic, that network got together and decided enough was enough: a new VC fund was needed to tackle the Climate Crisis in a different way. So today, World Fund, a new Climate Tech VC is launching with a €350 million fund targeting startups building technology that can help decarbonize the planet. World Fund claims its Europe’s largest dedicated climate tech VC. How did they build that size of a fund that fast? Well, it contains over 60 investors including current and former European tech founders, but also very few institutional LPs, hence why it could raise in such a relatively short time. Incubated by Ecosia, the fund will focus on energy, transport, food and agriculture, manufacturing, and buildings. As we’ve seen, the built environment is a huge contributor to CO2. Cities consume over two-thirds of the world’s energy and account for more than 70% of global CO2 emissions. World Fund’s says its mission will be to save 2 gigatons of emissions by 2040 – the equivalent to 4% of all global emissions. This is pretty good for one single firm, although the scale of the issue is enormous, with the world’s emissions needing to be laved by 2030 for the planet to have a chance of escaping 1.5 degrees warming. Key to this is using what it calls the Climate Performance Potential (CPP) as a key leading indicator for funding. Each company World Fund backs will need to be able to demonstrate it has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 100 megatonnes CO2e every year, said the firm, as “only companies enabling a decarbonized world can become the most valuable companies of the next decade.” Danijel Višević, General partner, World Fund said: “Europe urgently needs to stop continuing business as usual, relying on the continued use of fossil fuels. This continent has the research, innovation, and political awareness to lead the world in the fight against climate change. However, until now, there hasn’t been the venture support to ensure these solutions go from idea to success. This is why we’re launching the World Fund, to be the ultimate partner to back the tech entrepreneurs of Europe that will create the most valuable companies of the next decade while tackling the climate crisis.” Doubling down on Europe as a place to make climate tech investors would seem to make sense. 50% more climate tech patents have come from Europe than the US and China between 2019 and 2020, But only €6bn of VC funding went into European companies up to 2013 compared to €25bn and €17bn invested in the US and China respectively. Plus, according to World Fund’s research, there are 41 funds in North America with more than $100 million assets under management, compared to only six in Europe, and the majority of specific European climate tech VC funds have less than $40m to back disruptive technology. Furthermore, World Fund says there were more climate tech companies founded in Europe (102) between 2019 and 2021, than the US and China combined (80). Meanwhile, the European Commission’s Horizon 2020 fund is contributing €33bn to climate-relevant R&D. Making up the fund will be Tim Schumacher, co-founder of domain marketplace Sedo (and investor in Ecosia, Zolar, gridX, Pachama and CarbonCloud); Danijel Visevic, a former journalist who covered climate tech, startups and venture capital; Daria Saharova, worked at SevenVentures and Holtzbrinck. The team also also includes Craig Douglas, formerly with SET Ventures; and Christian Kroll as a venture partner, the founder and CEO of Ecosia. World Fund has revealed that it has invested in three companies so far: a meat-replacement startup, one in waste reduction, and Qoa Company. Which replaces Cocoa, a large source of CO2 emissions in agriculture. Global ‘competitors’ to World Fund include Astanor, Pale Blue Dot and 2150 VC which this month raised a $312m fund. The investment team also includes experts such as mechanical and chemical engineers, physicists, and a mathematician. LPs include Trivago co-founder Rolf Schrömgens; Econos, a sustainable investment platform founded by Alexander Samwer; serial female entrepreneur and author Verena Pausder and her husband Philipp Pausder, the founder of Thermondo. In addition, a leading scientific and advisory board including Max Planck Institute of Innovation & Entrepreneurship Professor director Dietmar Harhoff (who is also advising the German government and is a recipient of the Bundesverdienstkreuz – Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany); academic director and Scientists for Future founder Dr Gregor Hagedorn; and Deputy Head of Responsible Research at Fraunhofer Institute Simone Kaiser help advise World Fund. Tim Schumacher, General Partner at World Fund, added: “I’ve been investing in technology for over ten years now, both in regular software and in climate tech, and during that time my climate investments outperformed my other investments. Undoubtedly, one of the reasons for this is the caliber of people attracted to working on the largest problem humanity faces. At World Fund, we recognize that to tackle climate change, investing in new technology needs to be profitable and scalable.” Daria Saharova, General Partner at World Fund, said: “There’s a huge opportunity to back the startups helping to roll back the clock on the climate crisis and transform the way whole sectors operate. From farming startups to battery technology, startups addressing climate change need more funds with deep pockets and a commitment to support dynamic companies, to ensure they can fulfill their potential.”",2021-10-26 07:01:30,,,techcrunch,True,"[('Ecosia', 'ORG'), ('Ecosia', 'ORG'), ('Last year', 'DATE'), ('March 2020', 'DATE'), ('VC', 'ORG'), ('the Climate Crisis', 'ORG'), ('today', 'DATE'), ('World Fund', 'ORG'), ('VC', 'PRODUCT'), ('€350 million', 'MONEY'), ('World Fund', 'ORG'), ('Europe', 'LOC'), ('VC', 'PRODUCT'), ('60', 'CARDINAL'), ('European', 'NORP'), ('Ecosia', 'ORG'), ('two-thirds', 'CARDINAL'), ('more than 70%', 'PERCENT'), ('World Fund’s', 'ORG'), ('2', 'CARDINAL'), ('2040', 'DATE'), ('4%', 'PERCENT'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('2030', 'DATE'), ('1.5 degrees', 'QUANTITY'), ('the Climate Performance Potential', 'ORG'), ('CPP', 'ORG'), ('World Fund', 'ORG'), ('at least 100', 'CARDINAL'), ('every year', 'DATE'), ('the next decade', 'DATE'), ('World Fund', 'ORG'), ('Europe', 'LOC'), ('the World Fund', 'ORG'), ('Europe', 'LOC'), ('the next decade', 'DATE'), ('Europe', 'LOC'), ('50%', 'PERCENT'), ('Europe', 'LOC'), ('US', 'GPE'), ('China', 'GPE'), ('between 2019 and 2020', 'DATE'), ('only €6bn', 'MONEY'), ('VC', 'ORG'), ('European', 'NORP'), ('2013', 'DATE'), ('US', 'GPE'), ('China', 'GPE'), ('World Fund’s', 'ORG'), ('41', 'CARDINAL'), ('North America', 'LOC'), ('more than $100 million', 'MONEY'), ('only six', 'CARDINAL'), ('Europe', 'LOC'), ('European', 'NORP'), ('VC', 'ORG'), ('less than $40', 'MONEY'), ('World Fund', 'ORG'), ('Europe', 'LOC'), ('102', 'CARDINAL'), ('between 2019 and 2021', 'DATE'), ('US', 'GPE'), ('China', 'GPE'), ('80', 'CARDINAL'), ('the European Commission’s', 'ORG'), ('Horizon 2020', 'EVENT'), ('Tim Schumacher', 'PERSON'), ('Sedo', 'PERSON'), ('Ecosia', 'GPE'), ('Zolar', 'GPE'), ('Pachama', 'PERSON'), ('CarbonCloud', 'ORG'), ('Danijel Visevic', 'PERSON'), ('Daria Saharova', 'ORG'), ('SevenVentures and Holtzbrinck', 'ORG'), ('Craig Douglas', 'PERSON'), ('SET Ventures', 'ORG'), ('Christian Kroll', 'PERSON'), ('Ecosia', 'ORG'), ('World Fund', 'ORG'), ('three', 'CARDINAL'), ('Qoa Company', 'PERSON'), ('CO2', 'PRODUCT'), ('World Fund', 'ORG'), ('Astanor', 'PERSON'), ('Pale Blue Dot', 'PERSON'), ('2150', 'CARDINAL'), ('VC', 'ORG'), ('this month', 'DATE'), ('312', 'MONEY'), ('LPs', 'CARDINAL'), ('Trivago co-founder', 'ORG'), ('Rolf Schrömgens', 'PERSON'), ('Econos', 'PRODUCT'), ('Alexander Samwer', 'PERSON'), ('Verena Pausder', 'PERSON'), ('Philipp Pausder', 'PERSON'), ('Thermondo', 'ORG'), ('Max Planck Institute of Innovation & Entrepreneurship', 'ORG'), ('Dietmar Harhoff', 'PERSON'), ('German', 'NORP'), ('the Federal Republic of Germany', 'GPE'), ('Gregor Hagedorn', 'PERSON'), ('Deputy Head of', 'PERSON'), ('Fraunhofer Institute Simone Kaiser', 'ORG'), ('World Fund', 'ORG'), ('Tim Schumacher', 'PERSON'), ('General Partner', 'ORG'), ('World Fund', 'ORG'), ('ten years', 'DATE'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('World Fund', 'ORG'), ('Daria Saharova', 'PERSON'), ('General Partner', 'ORG'), ('World Fund', 'ORG')]"

The request came in after the permit given to the telecom companies will end on November 26. If the telecom department agrees to the extension, the 5G auction will push towards the second half of 2022. In May this year, the government had allotted spectrum to telecom companies in the 700 MHz band, 3.3-3.6 GHz (GHz) band, and 24.25-28.5 GHz band for testing at various locations for six months. The Department of Telecom has started the commercial launch of 5G with the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), seeking its opinion on the pricing and methodology for spectrum auction. As per the report, a telecom industry executive reported ET that “All three telcos want to extend their trials by another year.” However, 5G service may not be immediately available to everyone. It may take at least a year and a half for the cellular network infrastructure to develop in India fully. 5G Network price in India The minimum price set for the 5G spectrum in the 3.3-3.6 GHz band set up by DoT is Rs 50,000 crore which is too high to buy as per telco companies, and they hope the government reduces the price in its new recommendations. 5G trial Recently, Bharti Airtel and Ericsson together conducted a 5G network demonstration in a rural area. The demonstration took place in Bhaipur Bramanan village on the outskirts of Delhi/NCR using a 5G trial spectrum allocated to Airtel by the Department of Telecom. In September, Reliance Jio Bharti Airtel-Tata combines started 5G trials based on their equipment. The indigenous 5G trial was held in Navi Mumbai. The telco used its own 5G RAN and 5G standalone combo core to verify the network-slicing capability for real-time streaming. Recently Airtel gave a live demo of the low band 5G network on the non-stand-alone network with 4G hardware. Apart from this, there is no news from Airtel on the mmWave 5G band yet. Airtel and Ericsson are working together to roll out 5G. In contrast, Jio will roll out a 5G network in India in collaboration with Qualcomm. Indian operators may benefit from the delay in the 5G rollout. But the country is far behind from many other countries in terms of launching 5G services.

Read More","UK carriers have moved to ban fake calls that overseas marketers are using yo pretend they are local calls when in reality they are scammers often ignoring local Do Not Call registers. The Do Not Call Register is a secure database where individuals and organisations can register, check or remove their Australian telephone, mobile and fax numbers to opt out of receiving unsolicited telemarketing calls. Registration is free and you only need to do it once.To get around this spam callers or overseas marketers are using fake local numbers that it look as if a call is local. Once registered, a number will stay on the register indefinitely unless the number owner or their representative removes the number. EvIn Australia thousands of complaints are being made on unsolicited calls to what is being perceived as local telephone numbers – when in fact these phone calls have been coming from India, and Eastern Europe. The UK’s The Office of Communications (Ofcom) have taken the proactive approach in solving the issue by getting all major phone companies to automatically comply by blocking all internet calls coming from overseas – especially if they pretend to be coming from UK numbers. The technology they use is packet switching. According to the BBC, criminals have been using Internet- based calling technology to make it look as if these scam phone calls or the text is coming from a real UK telephone number causing millions of customers to be duped. To date, it has been reported that close to 45 million consumers have been targeted by phone scams in the UK. Ofcom said it expects the current measures to be introduced at a pace as a “priority” among telco operators however so far only one operator TalkTalk has complied. Other phone networks are still looking at ways of making these forced suggestions to work for them. Now comes the big question, should Australian telco’s follow the UK lead. We went around asking several telco operators and regulators and this is what we found. Andrew Sheridan Optus Vice President Regulatory and Public Affairs Andrew Sheridan said the operator had taken raft of measures to ensure that it customers were not victims of fraudulent calls. “Optus is thrilled our services are helping our customers, with more of us picking up the phone to stay connected during lockdowns, but we have also seen an uptick in suspicious calls,” he told ChannelNews. “In fact, in the four months March to June, Optus blocked 78.2 million calls under the requirements of the ACMA’s “Reducing Scam Calls Code,” a marked increase from our previous reporting. “Scam calls are big business, and Optus seeks to protect our customers by identifying and disabling fraudulent calls,” he added. Telstra chief information security officer Asia Pacific Narelle Devine in a blog post said that the company had blocked around 13 million suspected scam calls on a average per month from reaching end customers, which is a two-fold increase on the 6.5 million suspected scams calls we were blocking just four months ago. “Over the past few months, we’ve implemented a few new upgrades to our platform to catch even more suspicious calls, making our blocking strategy more aggressive with the ability to detect more types of scam calls than before. “Protecting customers from potential scams is a big deal – Scamwatch says that scam calls have cost Australians nearly $25 million already this year, on track to surpass last year’s $48.2 million that was lost to scam calls. So you can see why we’re working hard to try and stop these calls,” she said. ChannelNews had contacted Vodafone as well as the Australian Communications and Media Authority for comment but we have yet to receive a response to our queries at press time.  ",2021-10-26 03:03:31,,,channelnews,True,"[('UK', 'GPE'), ('Australian', 'NORP'), ('EvIn Australia', 'PERSON'), ('thousands', 'CARDINAL'), ('India', 'GPE'), ('Eastern Europe', 'LOC'), ('UK', 'GPE'), ('The Office of Communications', 'ORG'), ('Ofcom', 'ORG'), ('UK', 'GPE'), ('BBC', 'ORG'), ('UK', 'GPE'), ('millions', 'CARDINAL'), ('45 million', 'CARDINAL'), ('UK', 'GPE'), ('Ofcom', 'ORG'), ('Australian', 'NORP'), ('UK', 'GPE'), ('Andrew Sheridan Optus', 'PERSON'), ('Andrew Sheridan', 'PERSON'), ('Optus', 'ORG'), ('ChannelNews', 'ORG'), ('the four months March to June', 'DATE'), ('Optus', 'ORG'), ('78.2 million', 'CARDINAL'), ('Reducing Scam Calls Code', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Optus', 'ORG'), ('Telstra', 'NORP'), ('Asia Pacific Narelle Devine', 'ORG'), ('around 13 million', 'CARDINAL'), ('a average per month', 'DATE'), ('two-fold', 'CARDINAL'), ('6.5 million', 'CARDINAL'), ('just four months ago', 'DATE'), ('the past few months', 'DATE'), ('Scamwatch', 'PERSON'), ('Australians', 'NORP'), ('nearly $25 million', 'MONEY'), ('this year', 'DATE'), ('last year', 'DATE'), ('$48.2 million', 'MONEY'), ('ChannelNews', 'ORG'), ('Vodafone', 'ORG'), ('the Australian Communications', 'ORG'), ('Media Authority', 'ORG')]"

The Addressing Telecommunications Affordability: Evaluating Support for Low Income Consumers report found 57 per cent of low-income earners experienced “some difficulty” in accessing and paying for NBN or broadband, and 59 per cent had “some difficulty” paying for a phone service with data. The answer is simple, according to those low income earners: a discounted service, affordable hardware, and better free public Wi-Fi. Telstra is currently required to offer such products, under the Carriage Service Provider rules, but ACCAN wants this expanded to all telcos. “With more and more government services moving online, it is only fair that the government take steps to ensure that the people who use these services are able to get connected,” Corbin says.",2021-10-26 00:47:17,,,channelnews,True,"[('Australian', 'NORP'), ('The Australian Communications Consumer Action Network', 'ORG'), ('Australia', 'GPE'), ('Australians', 'NORP'), ('ACCAN', 'ORG'), ('Teresa Corbin', 'PERSON'), ('The Addressing Telecommunications Affordability: Evaluating Support', 'ORG'), ('57 per cent', 'MONEY'), ('NBN', 'ORG'), ('59 per cent', 'MONEY'), ('Telstra', 'NORP'), ('the Carriage Service Provider', 'ORG'), ('ACCAN', 'ORG'), ('Corbin', 'PERSON')]"

Read More","As Australia continues to open up, brands will need to advertise in order to lure consumers back into spending money, according to Deloitte Access Economics. Deloitte forecast household spending will grow 1.6 per cent in FY22, but advertising spend is key in bolstering this. “Advertising spend is going to be really important for getting consumers to not just leave the house, but also to open their wallets, especially for service businesses like hospitality, entertainment and travel,” said John O’Mahony, partner at Deloitte Access Economics. “Businesses cannot rely on pre-pandemic perceptions of their brands – consumers have changed in the past 18 months, in terms of needs and outlook, and advertising needs to reflect that.” Advertising works. It’s also great for the economy. Deloitte’s study, ‘Ad Pays’, found that each dollar spent on advertising lifted the Australian economy by $3. Deloitte also predict ad spending will lift to pre-pandemic levels next year. But multiple global supply chain issues are working together to undo this projection. As we reported yesterday, ships waiting to offload and load cargo at ports in Los Angeles and Long Beach have reached record levels. There are dozens just floating in waters outside the ports that have been there for weeks. Over a hundred ships are waiting to offload cargo. This is impacting American consumer spending, with manufacturers and retailers unable to move goods in and out of the United States. If these companies can’t get their products to market, they won’t advertise. This is spilling into the tech world, with giants like Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Google — who all rely upon advertising dollars — suddenly under strain. Evan Spiegel , CEO and co-founder of Snapchat sounded the alarm last week during an earnings call. “Our advertising partners are facing a variety of supply chain interruptions and labor shortages,” he told investors. “This in turn reduces their short-term appetite to generate additional customer demand through advertising at a time when their businesses are already supply constrained.” This shortage tips into Australian spending. With iPhone 13 supply expected to be limited in the lead up to Christmas, and usual stocking headliners like the PlayStation 5 still not on Australian shelves a year after release, these are huge companies that won’t be indulging in their usual pre-Christmas advertising splurge. It took seven years for advertising spend to return to pre-GFC levels after the 2008 crash. Perhaps expecting a bounce back by next year is optimistic.  ",2021-10-25 23:06:04,,,channelnews,True,"[('Australia', 'GPE'), ('Deloitte Access Economics', 'ORG'), ('Deloitte', 'ORG'), ('1.6 per cent', 'MONEY'), ('John O’Mahony', 'PERSON'), ('Deloitte Access Economics', 'ORG'), ('the past 18 months', 'DATE'), ('Deloitte', 'ORG'), ('Australian', 'NORP'), ('3', 'MONEY'), ('Deloitte', 'ORG'), ('next year', 'DATE'), ('yesterday', 'DATE'), ('Los Angeles', 'GPE'), ('Long Beach', 'GPE'), ('dozens', 'CARDINAL'), ('weeks', 'DATE'), ('hundred', 'CARDINAL'), ('American', 'NORP'), ('the United States', 'GPE'), ('Amazon', 'ORG'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('Google', 'ORG'), ('Evan Spiegel', 'PERSON'), ('Snapchat', 'PERSON'), ('last week', 'DATE'), ('Australian', 'NORP'), ('13', 'CARDINAL'), ('Christmas', 'DATE'), ('the PlayStation 5', 'PRODUCT'), ('Australian', 'NORP'), ('a year', 'DATE'), ('pre-Christmas', 'DATE'), ('seven years', 'DATE'), ('2008', 'DATE'), ('next year', 'DATE')]"

This past week, the regulator heard public comment in two separate sessions on its draft environmental assessment of the proposed launch site, a normal part of the licensing process. It’s unclear when the FAA is likely to release a final decision on the license. The public comment period on the draft EA is open until November 1. NASA and Boeing: Starliner grounded until first half of 2022 The beleaguered Starliner spacecraft will not fly until sometime during the first half of next year at the earliest, NASA and Boeing executives confirmed. While Boeing is still unable to identify the root cause of why 13 of the 24 valves in the propulsion system remained stuck in the closed position during routine pre-mission activities, the company is suspecting Florida humidity and corrosion as the main culprit. Boeing emphasized during a media briefing that it had conducted multiple tests on these valves prior to Starliner making it to the launch pad, and yet it still didn’t catch the issue. Nevertheless, NASA’s manager of the Commercial Crew program Steve Stich said the agency maintains “every confidence that Boeing will be flying crew soon. “We’ll get this problem solved and then we’ll have two space transportation systems like we want, with Boeing and SpaceX both flying [ … ] I have no reason to believe Boeing won’t be successful.” Image Credits: NASA/Getty Images Senate committee to NASA: Pick two developers for lunar lander program Senators have directed NASA to select two teams to develop lunar landers under the Human Landing System program, according to a draft appropriations bill for the agency’s fiscal year 2022 budget. The catch? They’re only giving the agency an additional $100 million to do so. NASA has maintained that it selected SpaceX — and only SpaceX — to develop a lander because it submitted the lowest-cost bid: only $2.9 billion, compared to the price tags of Blue Origin’s proposal ($5.9 billion) and Dynetics ($9 billion). Given the significant difference in cost between the three proposals, it’s unclear how the Senate’s increase to the HLS program — which is only $100 million — will enable NASA to select an additional team. Image Credits: Blue Origin News from around the web LeoLabs, a startup developing a global tracking network for objects in orbit, has announced the sixth site for its next two ground phased-array radars: Western Australia. The site will help the company track launches from Asia, as well as orbital objects traveling over the southern hemisphere. Morgan Stanley Research released a survey showing that institutional investors and industry experts expect SpaceX to hit a higher valuation than Tesla. The automaker’s market cap currently sits at around $895.6 billion. Orbex, a Scottish space firm, has unveiled its “Prime” space rocket. According to a study from University of Exeter, launching Prime would produce up to 86% less emissions than a comparable launch vehicle. Rocket Lab has set a target date of November 10 for its next launch, where it will attempt the company’s third ocean recovery of its Electron first stage. For the first time, a helicopter will be stationed in the recovery zone to test communications and tracking, in preparation for future mid-air capture of the booster.

Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for October 25, 2021. What a day. We kicked off with news that a major, multibillion-dollar tech deal was kaput and closed out the trading day on news that another tech firm had reached the trillion-dollar market cap threshold. Facebook also reported earnings right after the bell, and TechCrunch dropped a host of hardware reviews. Tired yet? It’s Monday. – Alex P.S. Our SaaS event is in two days; get hype. Announcing the final agenda for TechCrunch Sessions: SaaS 2021 The TechCrunch Top 3 PayPal calls off Pinterest deal: So much for the fintech-social media tie-up of the decade. U.S. fintech giant PayPal has killed off its potential buy of Pinterest. Shares of PayPal rose. Shares of Pinterest cratered. I suppose our general skepticism of the deal wasn’t too far off the market. Tesla reaches $1T market cap: You may have missed it, but Tesla is now worth more than Facebook these days, cresting the $1 billion market cap market today during regular trading, while the social network closed the day worth a few dozen billion less. What drove Tesla’s gains? Hertz, amazingly enough. Facebook misses revenue expectations, promises reporting changes: After the bell today, Facebook reported its Q3 2021 earnings, including a revenue miss, a per-share profit beat, and news that it intends to break out its AR and VR revenues into a separate category from here on out. The latter is good news, though we’d appreciate more granular financial reporting from across the Empire of Zuck now that we know the company is capable of it. Shares of Facebook are up slightly, if still underwater from their Friday declines that came in the wake of Snap’s Q3 report. Startups/VC Before we get truly underway with all of our startup coverage, we have a new item from Unicorn Land: New York tech company Braze is going public. While it was not a unicorn when it last raised capital, the company will nearly certainly crash through the $1 billion valuation mark when it debuts on the public markets. All hail our commercial space future: A consortium of firms are coming together to build a commercial space station. Given how rapidly the ISS is showing its age, this is a good thing. Sierra Space announced that “Blue Origin and Boeing would be joining the team to send the [private space station] to orbit in the second half of the decade.” We are closer and closer to our Bond-villain future that we’ve all long awaited. Selfbook raises capital, pivots to business focus: The pandemic shook up quite a lot. Where we work. How we socialize. For hotel-booking company Selfbook, it shook up its business model. Now working for other companies, Selfbook “claims that its software gives hotels a way to accept ‘one-click’ payments directly on their websites while eliminating fraud and reducing chargebacks.” The startup is now worth $125 million. Cameo books acquisition: The celebrity-booking service Cameo has proven to have a popular model. You can pay a fee and have a celebrity or other notable figure record a message for you. I once got one from an Eagles player that a friend commissioned for me. Fun times. Anyhoo, the company has made its first acquisition, picking up Represent, which TechCrunch describes as “a marketing and merch company that helps celebrities and brands set up individualized online storefronts.” You can see the synergies, obviously. Are all the startup names taken? Here at TechCrunch, we joke that there are too many venture capital firms, so much so that they are starting to double-up on names. For Example, Shine Capital and Shine Capital. Regardless, a startup called Y42 has raised funds, showing the world how to avoid using someone else’s name. The Berlin-based startup has built a low-code data platform and just raised a $31 million Series A. Even more money to roll-up e-commerce brands: The race to buy e-commerce sellers continues this week with Boston-based Thrasio raising $1 billion more for its efforts. The company is now worth $10 billion. That’s a lot of money. Per TechCrunch, the company is buying more than a brand each week, and has 200 in its portfolio. Wild. New task app aims to tell you what you’re supposed to be doing right now: Meet Routine, a new startup working on a productivity tool that should help you manage your work day more efficiently. It’s a brand new take on to-do lists as it combines both tasks, non-actionable notes and a daily planner. Fintech’s growing role in the healthcare revolution Health care spending accounts for almost 18% of U.S. GDP, so it’s no surprise that digital health is attracting record levels of investment. This year, VCs have flowed $14.7 billion to health tech startups, compared to $14.6 billion in all of 2020. Given the high cost of care in the United States compared to other nations, pairing fintech with health tech is just good business. Simon Wu, an investment director with Cathay Innovation, says he’s paying close attention to these areas of convergence: Data and the transition to value-based care. Gamifying consumer wellness to stave off chronic illnesses. Fintech for affordability and reducing friction.

YouTube warns creators on lame kids’ content: If you churn out content on YouTube that you claim is for kids, but is “low quality, encourages negative behavior or attitudes or is heavily commercial,” get ready to stop making money on your videos. YouTube is going to yank monetization of videos thereof. This raises questions, like, “If YouTube can tell which kids-focused videos are low quality, why did it let them onto its platform in the first place?” And, “Is demonetization enough?” Microsoft to bring Shopify merchants to its platforms: Following in Google’s footsteps, Microsoft has teamed up with e-commerce giant Shopify to help get merchants that use its services onto Bing, Edge and other Redmond software products. Bing retains search market share, mind, so this is good news for Team Shopify. In the Good News files today, Best Buy and Home Depot are halting sales of hardware from “Chinese video surveillance technology makers Lorex and Ezviz” over what we described as “links to human rights abuses.” TechCrunch Experts Image Credits: SEAN GLADWELL / Getty Images Are you all caught up on last week’s coverage of growth marketing and software development?

The new fund, which will be based in Luxembourg, grew out of a mix of public and private investment. The European Investment Fund, the financing arm of the European Union’s European Investment Bank Group, committed €40 million, with additional participation by Luxembourg’s Ministry of the Economy and the National Credit and Investment Institution. While Promus Ventures’ invests across a range of industries, its track history in the space sector includes investments in Rocket Lab, Spire and Swift Navigation. Orbital Ventures, which made its first close in January 2020, has also made several investments, including in satellite terminal developer Isotropic Systems, geospatial data company Ellipsis Drive, and Denmark’s Fernride. “We continue to witness terrific growth and developments in the New Space industry, and we are excited to deploy this new sector-specific space fund,” Promus Ventures partner Pierre Festal said in a statement. “We are thankful to our investors for their trust and support in this endeavor. […] It’s a pivotal time for global space players and the outlook is strong.” The new fund is just the latest sector-specific space fund to emerge in recent years, as investor interest in the burgeoning orbital market continues to rise. Last week, Space Capital reported that investors – including VCs, angel investors, corporate investors, private equity and others – poured $8.7 billion into the industry in the third quarter of 2021 alone, positioning this year to beat 2020’s investing record. Much of the capital raised went to space companies that went public via mergers with blank-check firms.

Facebook is spending at least $10 billion this year on its metaverse division,https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745381/facebook-reality-labs-10-billion-metaverse,,['Jacob Kastrenakes'],,,"Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge Facebook plans to spend at least $10 billion this year on Facebook Reality Labs, its metaverse division tasked with creating AR and VR hardware, software, and content. “We are committed to bringing this long-term vision to life and we expect to increase our investments for the next several years,” the company writes in its third-quarter earnings release this afternoon. Facebook sees AR and VR as being core to “the next generation of online social experiences.” A sign that Reality Labs should be judged separately from Facebook’s core apps The division, which already makes the Oculus Quest headset and Portal lineup of calling devices, is clearly being positioned as the next big thing inside of Facebook. For one, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been talking about the metaverse nonstop for the past several months. And today, Facebook said it’s going to begin reporting earnings specifically for its Reality Labs segment, while Facebook’s main ads business — a staggering $28 billion this last quarter alone — will be reported under another bucket. It’s a sign to investors that the Reality Labs business matters and should be judged separately from how they value Facebook today. It’s also a move to, perhaps, distract from what else is going on in Facebook’s earnings today. The company missed revenue expectations by around $1 billion (this is not a lot, exactly, at Facebook’s scale), which speaks to some of the company’s struggles right now. Facebook blames a number of factors for this: COVID-19, the economy, and Apple’s recent ad-tracking changes — something we saw last week when Snap reported earnings, too. Apple updated iOS in April with a new privacy feature that requires users to actively opt in to allow apps to track them across other apps and websites. Initially, social media companies said they weren’t certain how much it would impact their ads businesses, which rely on that tracking in part to measure the efficacy of ads. It’s been a rough few weeks for Facebook. A series of stories in The Wall Street Journal detailed significant missteps by the company, including moderation issues and concerns about younger users’ mental health; the whistleblower who leaked those documents then testified before Congress; and just this morning, dozens of stories were published by a consortium of news outlets, including The Verge, covering even more problems for Facebook, including worries about declining usage among teens. Also, in the middle of all of that, Facebook’s apps were all down for a good chunk of a day in early October. None of that is mentioned in Facebook’s earnings release today. But it is the context behind these investments and changes. If the Facebook brand and apps are going to come with this kind of baggage, the company would like to push toward something new where, just maybe, it can escape all that.",2021-10-25 21:06:10,,,theverge,True,"[('Alex Castro', 'PERSON'), ('at least $10 billion', 'MONEY'), ('this year', 'DATE'), ('AR', 'PERSON'), ('the next several years', 'DATE'), ('third-quarter', 'DATE'), ('this afternoon', 'TIME'), ('AR', 'PERSON'), ('VR', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Facebook’s', 'ORG'), ('Portal', 'NORP'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('Mark Zuckerberg', 'PERSON'), ('the past several months', 'DATE'), ('today', 'DATE'), ('Reality Labs', 'PRODUCT'), ('Facebook’s', 'ORG'), ('$28 billion', 'MONEY'), ('this last quarter', 'DATE'), ('today', 'DATE'), ('Facebook’s', 'ORG'), ('today', 'DATE'), ('around $1 billion', 'MONEY'), ('Facebook’s', 'ORG'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('last week', 'DATE'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('April', 'DATE'), ('few weeks', 'DATE'), ('The Wall Street Journal', 'ORG'), ('Congress', 'ORG'), ('just this morning', 'TIME'), ('dozens', 'CARDINAL'), ('Facebook’s', 'PERSON'), ('a day', 'DATE'), ('early October', 'DATE'), ('Facebook’s', 'ORG'), ('today', 'DATE'), ('Facebook', 'ORG')]"
Best Buy and Home Depot drop security cameras linked to Uyghur surveillance,https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745068/best-buy-home-depot-lorex-ezviz-uyghur-surveillance-sales-dji,,['Mitchell Clark'],,,"Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge According to TechCrunch, Best Buy, Home Depot, and Lowes will no longer be selling security cameras from Lorex and Ezviz after the outlet reported on the brands’ parent companies’ involvement in supplying the Chinese government with surveillance tech. According to the US government, both Dahua (Lorex’s owner) and Hikvision (Ezviz’s owner) stand implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. They have reportedly helped supply surveillance equipment for monitoring ethnic minorities. One of the largest oppressed groups is the Uyghurs, a largely Muslim ethnic group the Chinese government is accused of putting in detention or reeducation camps, using as forced labor, and more. The home security cameras and systems from Lorex and Ezviz aren’t banned from sale in the US, despite restrictions from the Department of Commerce on their parent companies. However, when TechCrunch reached out to retailers about Lorex and Ezviz’s links, Home Depot and Best Buy reportedly promised to stop working with the companies. Home Depot cited its “standards of ethical sourcing” as its reason for pulling the products from its online store, and while Lowes reportedly didn’t respond about the matter, Lorex’s products were pulled from its site. Lorex security cameras are still available for purchase on Best Buy’s site Best Buy told TechCrunch that it would be “discontinuing its relationship” with the companies. However, Lorex’s security cameras still seem to be available on its site (and certain models are even on sale). Searching Ezviz turns up no results. Home Depot and Lowes’ search systems don’t return anything for Lorex either; while the latter shows results for Ezviz, all the products are listed as unavailable. Best Buy’s site still shows many Lorex products. (Screenshot taken on October 25th, at 1:40PM ET.) These surveillance issues aren’t only limited to security camera companies. The US government has limited how US companies can work with drone maker DJI by adding it to the Entity List after reports raised concerns about its drones also being provided to police forces in Xinjiang. DJI’s consumer products are still allowed, but companies would face similar ethical dilemmas when it comes to selling DJI’s products as they would for Lorex (though DJI is a bigger name in drones than Lorex is in home security). Best Buy didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about whether it intends to keep selling DJI’s drones and cameras. In a statement to IPVM, a surveillance-focused outlet that co-reported the story with TechCrunch, the president of the World Uyghur Congress said that it’s “unacceptable that there are still American companies directly helping further” the group’s oppression. The statement could apply to retailers like Costco and Sam’s Club, which continue to sell Lorex products, but it could also apply to tech giants like Apple, Amazon, Tesla, and more, which have been tied to suppliers that reportedly used forced Uyghur labor. Despite the US government saying that China was committing genocide against Uyghurs, a report from The Dispatch says that the country didn’t admit a single refugee from the minority group between October 2020 and September 2021. The report cites difficulties escaping China due to checkpoints and video surveillance, a maze of red tape, and “lack of urgency” when granting asylum as reasons for the shortage of admissions.",2021-10-25 21:04:12,,,theverge,True,"[('Alex Castro', 'PERSON'), ('TechCrunch', 'ORG'), ('Best Buy', 'PERSON'), ('Home Depot', 'ORG'), ('Lowes', 'ORG'), ('Lorex and Ezviz', 'ORG'), ('Chinese', 'NORP'), ('US', 'GPE'), ('Dahua', 'PERSON'), ('Lorex’s', 'ORG'), ('Xinjiang', 'GPE'), ('One', 'CARDINAL'), ('Uyghurs', 'ORG'), ('Muslim', 'NORP'), ('Chinese', 'NORP'), ('Lorex and Ezviz', 'ORG'), ('US', 'GPE'), ('the Department of Commerce', 'ORG'), ('TechCrunch', 'ORG'), ('Lorex and Ezviz', 'ORG'), ('Home Depot', 'ORG'), ('Best Buy', 'PERSON'), ('Home Depot', 'ORG'), ('n’t', 'GPE'), ('Lorex’s', 'ORG'), ('Best Buy’s', 'PERSON'), ('Best Buy', 'PERSON'), ('TechCrunch', 'ORG'), ('Lorex’s', 'ORG'), ('Home Depot and Lowes', 'ORG'), ('Lorex', 'PERSON'), ('Ezviz', 'PERSON'), ('Lorex', 'ORG'), ('October 25th', 'DATE'), ('1:40PM', 'TIME'), ('US', 'GPE'), ('US', 'GPE'), ('the Entity List', 'LAW'), ('Xinjiang', 'GPE'), ('Lorex', 'PERSON'), ('Lorex', 'ORG'), ('Best Buy', 'PERSON'), ('IPVM', 'ORG'), ('TechCrunch', 'ORG'), ('the World Uyghur Congress', 'ORG'), ('American', 'NORP'), ('Costco', 'ORG'), ('Sam’s Club', 'PERSON'), ('Lorex', 'ORG'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('Amazon', 'ORG'), ('Tesla', 'ORG'), ('Uyghur', 'ORG'), ('US', 'GPE'), ('China', 'GPE'), ('Uyghurs', 'ORG'), ('between October 2020', 'DATE'), ('September 2021', 'DATE'), ('China', 'GPE')]"

In many cases, a sale gives a founder the opportunity to pay back investors and reward long-time employees, but what happens after the ink dries on the contract, and the reality of being owned by a larger company settles in? We’re going to get the inside scoop from three founders who sold their companies, on a panel called ‘What Happens After Your Startup is Acquired’ this Wednesday, October 27th, at TC Sessions: SaaS. Panelists include Monica Sarbu, who founded a startup called Packetbeat in 2013, which she sold to Elastic in 2015. She stuck around and ran the Beats team for almost three years. She is currently founder and CEO at Xata, and also runs Tupo.io, a startup she launched last year to offer underrepresented folks in tech free mentorship We also have Jyoti Bansal, who sold his company, AppDynamics to Cisco the week it was going to IPO in 2017 for $3.7 billion. Bansal actually didn’t hang around, leaving the company upon the sale. Today, he runs two startup, Harness and Traceable, and also founded the venture capital firm, Unusual Ventures. Finally, we will talk to current Gainsight founder and CEO Nick Mehta, who sold his former company LiveOffice to Symantec in 2012 for $115 million. He stayed around for a brief period of time, but wasn’t really involved with the company after the sale closed. One thing is clear from these three founders: Each acquisition experience is going to be different, and selling your company is definitely not the end of the story. We are going to discuss what goes into selling your company, how and why founders decide to do it, and if you join another team, what it’s like to go from being in charge to being an employee. Further we are going to talk about the emotional side of selling and what it’s like to walk away from something you put so much time and energy into building. Finally, we will cover what each founder learned from that experience of selling the company, how it helped them grow as business people, and what you can learn as founders looking at your company’s startup journey. The panel is part of a full agenda for the day-long session looking at the impact of SaaS. In addition to this panel, we’ll have panels on open source, the value of data and the role of automation. Other speakers include Microsoft’s Jared Spataro, Puppet’s Abby Kearns and Google’s Javier Soltero. We hope you’ll join us. It’s going to be a full day.

The report couched Facebook’s plan to extend its use of e2e encryption as “controversial” — aligning the newspaper’s choice of editorial spin with long-running UK government pressure on tech giants not to expand their use of strong encryption in order that platforms can be ordered to decrypt and hand over message content data on request. In its interview with Haugen, the Telegraph sought to link her very public concerns about Facebook’s overall lack of accountability to this UK government anti-e2ee agenda — claiming she had suggested Facebook’s use of e2e encryption could disrupt efforts to protect Uighur dissidents from Chinese state efforts to inject their devices with malware. The reported remarks were quickly seized upon by certain corners of the Internet (and at least one other ex-Facebook staffer who actually worked on adding e2e encryption to Messenger and is now self-styling as a ‘whistleblower’) — with concerns flying that her comments could be used to undermine e2e encryption generally and, therefore, the safety of scores of Internet users. Sounding unimpressed with the Telegraph’s spin, Haugen told UK lawmakers that her views on e2e encryption had been “misrepresented” — saying she fully supports “e2e open source encryption software”; and, indeed, that she uses it herself on a daily basis. What she said she had actually been querying was whether Facebook’s claim to be implementing e2e encryption can be trusted, given the tech giant does not allow for full external inspection of its code as is the case with fully open source e2ee alternatives. This is another reason why public oversight of the tech giant is essential, Haugen told the joint committee of the UK parliament which is scrutinizing (controversial) draft online safety legislation. “I want to be very, very clear. I was mischaracterised in the Telegraph yesterday on my opinions around end-to-end encryption,” she said. “I am a strong supporter of access to open source end to end encryption software. “I support access to end-to-end encryption and I use open source end-to-end encryption every day. My social support network is currently on an open source end-to-end encryption service.” “Part of why I am such an advocate for open source software in this case is that if you’re an activist, if you’re someone who has a sensitive need, a journalist, a whistleblower — my primary form of social software is an open source, end-to-end encryption chat platform,” she also said, without naming exactly which platform she uses for her own e2ee messaging (Signal seems likely — a not-for-profit rival to Facebook-owned WhatsApp which has benefited from millions of dollars of investment from WhatsApp founder Brian Action, another former Fb staffer turned critic; so maybe ‘meta’ would in fact be a perfect new brand name for Facebook). “But part of why that open source part is so important is you can see the code, anyone can go and look at it — and for the top open source end-to-end encryption platform those are some of the only ways you’re allowed to do chat in say the defence department in the US. “Facebook’s plan for end-to-end encryption — I think — is concerning because we have no idea what they’re doing to do. We don’t know what it means, we don’t if people’s privacy is actually protected. It’s super nuanced and it’s also a different context. On the open source end-to-end encryption product that I like to use there is no directory where you can find 14 year olds, there is no directory where you can go and find the Uighur community in Bangkok. On Facebook it is trivially easy to access vulnerable populations and there are national state actors that are doing this. “So I want to be clear, I am not against end-to-end encryption in Messenger but I do believe the public has a right to know what does that even mean? Are they really going to produce end-to-end encryption? Because if they say they’re doing end-to-end encryption and they don’t really do that people’s lives are in danger. And I personally don’t trust Facebook currently to tell the truth… I am concerned about them misconstruing the product that they’ve built — and they need regulatory oversight for that.” In additional remarks to the committee she further summarized her position by saying: “I am concerned on one side that the constellation of factors related to Facebook makes it even more necessary for public oversight of how they do encryption there — that’s things like access to the directory, those amplification settings. But the second one is just about security. If people think they’re using an end-to-end encryption product and Facebook’s interpretation of that is different than what, say, an open source product would do — because an open source product we can all look at it and make sure that what is says on the label is in the can. “But if Facebook claims they’ve built an end-to-end encryption thing and there’s really vulnerabilities people’s lives are on the line — and that’s what I’m concerned about. We need public oversight of anything Facebook does around end-to-end encryption because they are making people feel safe when they might be in danger.” Haugen, a former Facebook staffer from the civic integrity team, is the source for a tsunami of recent stories about Facebook’s business after she leaked thousands of pages of internal documents and research reports to the media, initially providing information to the Wall Street Journal, which published a slew of stories last month, including about the toxicity of Instagram for teens (aka the ‘Facebook Files‘), and subsequently releasing the data to a number of media outlets which have followed up with reports today on what they’re calling the Facebook Papers. The tl;dr of all these stories is Facebook prioritizes growth of its business over product safety — leading to a slew of harms that can affect individuals, other businesses and the public/society more generally whether as a result of inadequate AI systems that cannot properly identify and remove hate speech (leading to situations where its platform can whip up ethnic violence), or which allow engagement based ranking systems to routinely amplify extreme, radicalizing content without proper mind to risks (such as forming conspiracy-theory touting echo chambers forming around vulnerable individuals, isolating them from wider society), or overestimation of its ad reach leading to advertisers being systematically overcharged for its adtech. Internal Facebook documents highlight its moderation and misinformation issues During her testimony today, Haugen suggested Facebook’s AIs were unlikely to even be able to properly distinguish dialectal distinctions and nuances of meaning between UK English and US English — let alone the scores of languages in countries where it directs far less resource. Parliamentarians probed her on myriad harms during around 2.5 hours of testimony — and some of her answers repeated earlier testimony she gave to lawmakers in the US. Many of the UK committee’s questions asked for her view on what might be effective regulatory measures to close the accountability gap — both on Facebook and social media more generally — as MPs sought to identify profitable avenues for amending draft online safety legislation. “The danger with Facebook is not individuals saying bad things, it is about the systems of amplification that disproportionately give people saying extreme polarising things the largest megaphone in the room,” argued Haugen. Her list of suggestions for fixing a system of what she couched as broken incentives under Facebook’s current leadership included mandatory risk assessments — which she warned need to cover both product safety and organisational structure since she said much of the blame for Facebook’s problems lies with its “flat” organizational structure and a leadership team that rewards (and thus incentivizes) growth above all else, leaving no one internally who’s accountable for improving safety metrics. Such risk assessments would need to be carefully overseen by regulators to avoid Facebook using its customary tactic in the face of critical scrutiny of just marking its own homework — or “dancing with data” as she put it. Risk assessments should also involve the regulator “gathering from the community and saying are there other things that we should be concerned about”, she said, not just letting tech giants like Facebook define blinkered parameters for uselessly partial oversight — suggesting “a tandem approach like that that requires companies to articulate their solutions”. “I think that’s a flexible approach; I think that might work for quite a long time. But it has to be mandatory and there have to be certain quality bars because if Facebook can phone in it I guarantee you they’ll phone it in,” she also told the committee. Another recommendation Haugen had was for mandatory moderation of Facebook Groups when they exceed a certain number of users. Whereas — left unmoderated — she said groups can be easily misappropriated and/or misused (using techniques like ‘virality-hacking’) to act as an “amplification point” for spreading discord or disseminate disinformation, including by foreign information operations. “I strongly recommend that above a certain sized group they should be required to provide their own moderators and moderate every post,” she said. “This would naturally — in a content-agnostic way — regulate the impact of those large groups. Because if that group is actually valuable enough they will have no trouble recruiting volunteers.” Haugen also suggested that Facebook should be forced to make a firehose of information available to external researchers (as Twitter, for example, already does) — in a privacy-safe way — which would allow outside academics and experts to drive accountability from the outside by investigating potential issues and identifying concerns freed from Facebook’s internal growth-focused lens. Another of her recommendations was for regulators to demand segmented analysis from Facebook — so that oversight bodies get full transparency into populations that disproportionately experience harms on its platform. “The median experience on Facebook is a pretty good experience — the real danger is that 20% of the population has a horrible experience or an experience that is dangerous,” she suggested. She went on to argue that many of Facebook’s problems result from the sub-set of users who she said get “hyper exposed” to toxicity or to abuse — as a consequence of an engagement-driven design and growth-focused mindset that rejects even small tweaks to inject friction/reduce virality (and which she suggested would only mean Facebook giving up “small slivers” of growth in the short term and yield a much more pleasant and probably more profitable product over the longer term). “As we look at the harms of Facebook we need to think about these things as system problems — like the idea that these systems are designed products, these are intentional choices and that it’s often difficult to see the forest for the trees. That Facebook is a system of incentives, it’s full of good, kind, conscientious people who are working with bad incentives. And that there are lack of incentives inside the company to raise issues about flaws in the system and there’s lots of rewards for amplifying and making things grow more,” she told the committee. “So I think there is a big challenge of Facebook’s management philosophy is that they can just pick good metrics and then let people run free. And so they have found themselves in a trap where in a world like that how do you propose changing the metric? It’s very very hard because 1,000 people might have directed their labor for six months trying to move that metric and changing the metric will disrupt all of that work. “I don’t think any of it was intentional — I don’t think they set out to go down this path. And that’s why we need regulation — mandatory regulation, mandatory actions — to help pull them away from that spiral that they’re caught in.” Legislation that seeks to rein in online harms by applying regulations to platform giants like Facebook must also not focus only on individual harms — but needs to respond to societal harms, she also emphasized. “I think it is a grave danger to democracy and societies around the world to omit societal harm. A core part of why I came forward was I looked at the consequences of choices Facebook was making and I looked at things like the global south and I believe situations like Ethiopia are just part of the opening chapters of a novel that’s going to be horrific to read. We have to care about societal harm — not just for the global south but for our own societies. “When an oil spill happens it doesn’t make it harder for us to regulate oil companies. But right now Facebook is closing the door on us being able to act — we have a slight window of time to regain people-control over AI; we have to take advantage of this moment.” Facebook has been contacted for comment.

Many of the UK committee’s questions asked for her view on what might be effective regulatory measures to close the accountability gap — both on Facebook and social media more generally — as MPs sought to identify profitable avenues for amending draft online safety legislation. “The danger with Facebook is not individuals saying bad things, it is about the systems of amplification that disproportionately give people saying extreme polarising things the largest megaphone in the room,” argued Haugen. Her list of suggestions for fixing a system of what she couched as broken incentives under Facebook’s current leadership included mandatory risk assessments — which she warned need to cover both product safety and organisational structure since she said much of the blame for Facebook’s problems lies with its “flat” organizational structure and a leadership team that rewards (and thus incentivizes) growth above all else, leaving no one internally who’s accountable for improving safety metrics. Such risk assessments would need to be carefully overseen by regulators to avoid Facebook using its customary tactic in the face of critical scrutiny of just marking its own homework — or “dancing with data” as she put it. Risk assessments should also involve the regulator “gathering from the community and saying are there other things that we should be concerned about”, she said, not just letting tech giants like Facebook define blinkered parameters for uselessly partial oversight — suggesting “a tandem approach like that that requires companies to articulate their solutions”. “I think that’s a flexible approach; I think that might work for quite a long time. But it has to be mandatory and there have to be certain quality bars because if Facebook can phone in it I guarantee you they’ll phone it in,” she also told the committee. Another recommendation Haugen had was for mandatory moderation of Facebook Groups when they exceed a certain number of users. Whereas — left unmoderated — she said groups can be easily misappropriated and/or misused (using techniques like ‘virality-hacking’) to act as an “amplification point” for spreading discord or disseminate disinformation, including by foreign information operations. “I strongly recommend that above a certain sized group they should be required to provide their own moderators and moderate every post,” she said. “This would naturally — in a content-agnostic way — regulate the impact of those large groups. Because if that group is actually valuable enough they will have no trouble recruiting volunteers.” Haugen also suggested that Facebook should be forced to make a firehose of information available to external researchers (as Twitter, for example, already does) — in a privacy-safe way — which would allow outside academics and experts to drive accountability from the outside by investigating potential issues and identifying concerns freed from Facebook’s internal growth-focused lens. Another of her recommendations was for regulators to demand segmented analysis from Facebook — so that oversight bodies get full transparency into populations that disproportionately experience harms on its platform. “The median experience on Facebook is a pretty good experience — the real danger is that 20% of the population has a horrible experience or an experience that is dangerous,” she suggested. She went on to argue that many of Facebook’s problems result from the sub-set of users who she said get “hyper exposed” to toxicity or to abuse — as a consequence of an engagement-driven design and growth-focused mindset that rejects even small tweaks to inject friction/reduce virality (and which she suggested would only mean Facebook giving up “small slivers” of growth in the short term and yield a much more pleasant and probably more profitable product over the longer term). “As we look at the harms of Facebook we need to think about these things as system problems — like the idea that these systems are designed products, these are intentional choices and that it’s often difficult to see the forest for the trees. That Facebook is a system of incentives, it’s full of good, kind, conscientious people who are working with bad incentives. And that there are lack of incentives inside the company to raise issues about flaws in the system and there’s lots of rewards for amplifying and making things grow more,” she told the committee. “So I think there is a big challenge of Facebook’s management philosophy is that they can just pick good metrics and then let people run free. And so they have found themselves in a trap where in a world like that how do you propose changing the metric? It’s very very hard because 1,000 people might have directed their labor for six months trying to move that metric and changing the metric will disrupt all of that work. “I don’t think any of it was intentional — I don’t think they set out to go down this path. And that’s why we need regulation — mandatory regulation, mandatory actions — to help pull them away from that spiral that they’re caught in.” Legislation that seeks to rein in online harms by applying regulations to platform giants like Facebook must also not focus only on individual harms — but needs to respond to societal harms, she also emphasized. “I think it is a grave danger to democracy and societies around the world to omit societal harm. A core part of why I came forward was I looked at the consequences of choices Facebook was making and I looked at things like the global south and I believe situations like Ethiopia are just part of the opening chapters of a novel that’s going to be horrific to read. We have to care about societal harm — not just for the global south but for our own societies. “When an oil spill happens it doesn’t make it harder for us to regulate oil companies. But right now Facebook is closing the door on us being able to act — we have a slight window of time to regain people-control over AI; we have to take advantage of this moment.” Facebook has been contacted for comment.

Typically, loan apps collect borrowers phone data including contacts and demand access to messages to check the history of mobile money transactions – for credit scoring and as conditions for disbursing loans. Rogue lenders then use some of the contact information collected to recover the loans disbursed in cases where borrowers default. Reports indicate that digital lenders resort to debt shaming tactics, like calling friends and family, to compel their borrowers to repay the loans. The change adds to a raft of measures taken by Kenyan lawmakers to protect citizens from rogue digital lenders who offer high-priced collateral-free loans. It grants the regulator, Central Bank of Kenya, power to oversee the operations of standalone digital lenders (not affiliated with banks) after a period of self-regulation. Digital lenders, will going forward, be required to obtain licenses to operate in Kenya unlike previously where they just had to register – which led to the proliferation of rogue apps. The Central Bank of Kenya amendment 2021 bill also gives the regulator the power to cap interest rates and to suspend or revoke the licenses of digital lenders that breach “the conditions of the Data Protection Act or the Consumer Protection Act.” Kenya’s Data Protection Act requires firms to disclose to customers the reasons for collecting their data. It also ensures that borrowers’ confidential information is safe from infringement by unauthorized parties. This comes as consumer lobbies accuse loan apps of sharing customer information with data and marketing companies. The digital lenders will also be required to reveal all the information concerning their products, and this includes details on pricing, penalties for defaulters and means of debt recovery. This is in line with the country’s Consumer Protection Act which requires sellers to disclose to consumers all the terms and conditions pertaining to the purchase of goods or services. Almost all lending apps were found to use debt shaming tactics to recover debt in Kenya. Kenya is home to about 100 mobile lending apps including Okash and Opesa both owned by the Chinese-owned browsing giant Opera, and which have faced claims of using predatory lending tactics in Kenya. Okash and Opesa are some of tens other loan apps that were found to charge exorbitant interest rates and to have exploitative terms – like issuing 30-day loans instead of the 60 days stipulated by Google Play Store policies. The interest rates of the two Chinese loan apps were exorbitant reaching up to 876% annualized rates yet banks yearly rates rarely exceed 20%. Other apps including the San-Francisco based Branch International Ltd., and Paypal backed Tala, were found to charge extortionist rates, with annualized interest rates of 156-348% and 84-152.4%, respectively. The lenders’ lobby, which represents 25 digital lenders disbursing about $40 million a month, told TechCrunch that members expressed their concern over capping of the interest rate but said they were happy with the new law especially because their feedback was taken. The association lobbied for the removal of minimum capital requirements, deposit rations and for the regulator to cede control of innovation or new products. “We are happy that the space is regulated now and that we are able to access the Central Bank (regulator) and mechanisms for dispute regulations have also been put in place. But price control is what concerns us and we are not happy with that – the moment you put an interest rate cap then there won’t be any lending. We are nervous about that but it is fair,” said the Digital Lenders Association of Kenya chairman, Kevin Mutiso. But having regulations in place, Mutiso said, is going to help grow the lending space in the country as the lenders collaborate with partners including the regulator to make it more robust. “Lack of regulation was making the market unpredictable, now we know what we can do and not do. And also, we are going to have better debt collection practices,” said Mutiso. “The law, we believe, is going to make Kenya to be the number one fintech market in the world because everything is clear now – from what is expected from the lenders and the borrowers. We are also going to see better products efor our customers especially the MSMEs (micro and small medium enterprises),” he said. The apps offer collateral-free loans making them attractive to borrowers looking for quick cash, and who are often locked out by banks due to prerequisites such as account history. While digital credit is easily accessible, its short tenure makes it expensive, while ease of access has led to borrowing from multiple apps resulting in debt distress and the reduction of credit scores – affecting the borrowers’ ability to obtain credit from banks in future. A study by the Kenya Bankers Association shows that convenience and ease of access are the predominant reasons that customers take into account when making decisions on the platforms to access credit from. It found that self-employed people prefer digital to conventional credit attributable to liquidity changes that they encounter while in their line of business, pointing to how loan apps are preferred during emergencies too. The new law gives the regulator powers to determine the pricing parameters that will be followed by the digital lenders when setting the cost of credit. Exorbitant interest rates are not unique to Kenya, in India, loan apps were found to charge interest rates as high as 60% per week. There were reports of people committing suicide after harassment by loan-recovery agents in the south Asian country. West African countries have also witnessed the proliferation of loan apps, with Nigeria among the largest markets in the region. A report by the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP), a research and advocacy organization, also found digital loan default rates and delinquency high among 20 million borrowers in Tanzania. It reported that most borrowers used the loans for daily needs instead of emergencies or for investments. “One of the most important things regulators can do to reduce these numbers is to improve transparency on loan terms and conditions, making it easier for customers to make informed decisions,” said CGAP.

The White Coat Waste Project, a conservative nonprofit, claims that the National Institute of Health (NIH) helped fund several tests on 44 beagle puppies with the approval of Fauci, according to The Hill. Citing documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, the group says that the experiments were conducted in Tunisia, in North Africa, where scientists allegedly removed the dogs’ vocal cords to prevent barking. “Our investigators show that Fauci’s NIH division shipped part of a $375,800 grant to a lab in Tunisia to drug beagles and lock their heads in mesh cages filled with hungry sand flies so that the insects could eat them alive,” the nonprofit told The Hill. “They also locked beagles alone in cages in the desert overnight for nine consecutive nights to use them as bait to attract infectious sand flies.” The experiments were reportedly conducted in order to test the efficacy of experimental drugs to fight against a parasite carried by sandflies. The puppies were allegedly infected with the parasite and given the drug, before they were killed and dissected, according to The Independent. In response to the bold claims, a bipartisan group of lawmakers led by South Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace have penned a letter demanding a response from Fauci and the NIH, saying that the experiments are “cruel” and a “reprehensible misuse of taxpayer funds.” Despite the dark nature of the claims, the reality is that medical and scientific testing on animals has long been funded by the US government, and has even led to breakthroughs in diseases such as HIV and diabetes. However, the subject is fraught due to ethical issues surrounding animal abuse and cruelty. It’s worth noting that it’s still entirely unclear whether or not Fauci approved or was even aware of the experiments being conducted. There’s also no evidence that any of the dogs were eaten alive, as the nonprofit claims. The White Coat Waste Project also has a history of targeting the White House chief medical advisor, specifically singling him out when the group reported that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was being funded in part by US taxpayers earlier this year. Since the nonprofit has a conservative bent, it’s not a stretch to believe that this could just be another attempt to smear Fauci.

He focuses on software, fintech, digital health and consumer investments. More posts by this contributor From startups to Starbucks: The embedded API opportunity How retailers can survive the Amazon era The quest to provide more affordable and accessible healthcare, magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic, has spurred an explosion of innovation, which in turn has attracted massive amounts of capital. To put this into perspective, consider this: In 2019, digital health saw $7.7 billion in VC investment, and that number rose to $14.6 billion in 2020. However, the first half of 2021 alone saw $14.7 billion in VC investment. Its marriage with fintech is the catalyst for the transformation of the healthcare industry. Similar to the unbundling of financial services and how fintech is scaling vertical SaaS, the pandemic-fueled disaggregation of healthcare has created new players that are taking a page out of the fintech revolution book — all starting with payments. A growing number of startups are now leveraging the fintech playbook to solve a key part of the healthcare problem — the shifting dynamics between patients, payers and providers, and how payments and related electronic health records (EHRs) flow between them. Not only is the onus of payments and data flow moving from payers to patients, but providers are now facing a monumental shift to new billing and engagement models, requiring new technologies and platforms to help with the change. Through the lens of fintech, here are three key areas to watch in healthcare. Gamifying consumer wellness to stave off chronic illnesses One of the largest trends impacting the population today is the steady rise of chronic illnesses. It is estimated that nearly half the U.S. population will have a chronic illness by 2025. People are getting sicker for longer periods of time, which leads to a constant spending streak. Patients not adhering to medical guidance is a major factor and is responsible for $100 billion of healthcare spending and over 100,000 deaths annually. With around a fifth of patients never filling their prescriptions, it has become a priority to educate and incentivize patients to complete care and avoid readmissions or ER visits. The convergence of health and fintech will be an important catalyst to address some of the most pressing issues facing healthcare today. To curb the rise of chronic illnesses and the associated recurring costs, many startups are using behavioral economics and gamification to incentivize patients and build healthy habits. For example, companies like Paceline in the U.S., Sweatcoin in Europe and Betterfly in Latin America gamify wellness by combining fitness and financial rewards. On the other hand, startups like Sempre Health and Wellth are tackling medical non-adherence with behavioral economics. For example, Wellth financially rewards actions like on-time prescription intake or regular A1c tests for diabetic patients. Fintech for affordability and reducing friction Looking at payers, there’s a major shift stemming from the rise of high-deductible healthcare plans (HDHP) — enrollment has risen 43% in the last five years — emphasizing an increase in premiums and patient financial responsibility. Out-of-pocket expenses threaten the financial stability for many, with 40% of Americans unable to pay an unexpected bill of $400.",2021-10-25 18:15:08,"The quest to provide more affordable and accessible healthcare, magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic, has spurred an explosion of innovation, which in turn has attracted massive amounts of capital. To put this into perspective, consider this: In 2019, digital health saw $7.7 billion in VC investment, and that number rose to $14.6 billion in 2020. However, the first half of 2021 alone saw $14.7 billion in VC investment. Its marriage with fintech is the catalyst for the transformation of the healthcare industry. Similar to the unbundling of financial services and how fintech is scaling vertical SaaS , the pandemic-fueled disaggregation of healthcare has created new players that are taking a page out of the fintech revolution book — all starting with payments. A growing number of startups are now leveraging the fintech playbook to solve a key part of the healthcare problem — the shifting dynamics between patients, payers and providers, and how payments and related electronic health records (EHRs) flow between them. Not only is the onus of payments and data flow moving from payers to patients, but providers are now facing a monumental shift to new billing and engagement models, requiring new technologies and platforms to help with the change. Through the lens of fintech, here are three key areas to watch in healthcare. One of the largest trends impacting the population today is the steady rise of chronic illnesses.

The company had previously warned this sort of content would no longer be eligible for inclusion in its dedicated YouTube Kids app, but starting next month YouTube will also begin to enforce new monetization policies as well, which may impact the creators’ eligibility for or possible removal from the YouTube Partner Program. YouTube first announced its plans to increase its protections for minors in August, saying that some of the updates would directly address upcoming regulations, while others were going beyond what would be required by law. At the time, YouTube said it would shift the default settings on videos for users ages 13 to 17 to private, would enable “take a break” and bedtime reminders for minors, would stop leveraging “interests” data for targeting teens and kids with ads, and more. Among the changes was a warning to those creators specifically making content aimed at kids, noting the company planned to remove “overly commercial content” from its standalone YouTube Kids app aimed at younger children. Ahead of this move, a number of consumer advocacy groups had been pressuring YouTube and regulators alike to put an end to these types of videos, saying they blurred the lines between content and advertising. Plus, they argued, some creators weren’t disclosing that they had brand relationships behind the scenes that were fueling this sort of content production. But without enforcement and guidelines around what’s appropriate for kids, some of YouTube’s largest creators were channels like multimillionaire Ryan Kaji of Ryan ToysReview (now Ryan’s World), which focused heavily on consumerism and toy unboxings. YouTube in August said that it would remove content from YouTube Kids that incited viewers to buy a product and “content focused on the excessive accumulation or consumption of products.” Now, YouTube is warning that any channel targeting younger audiences or those that are classified as “made for kids” could be at risk of demonization if they put out other sorts of low-quality content. This includes content that encourages negative behavior and attitudes (like bullying, dishonestly, disrespect to others, dangerous pranks, unhealthy eating habits, and more); content that’s deceptively educational; content that hinders comprehension; content that’s sensational or misleading; and content that includes strange use of children’s characters. (The latter had been a particular problem in recent years as videos featuring characters like Peppa Pig in situations that were not kid-friendly). Image Credits: YouTube Starting in November, YouTube says it will begin to enforce additional monetization policies with these quality principles in mind for channels designated “made for kids” or that frequently create content that’s made for kids. If the creators are making low-quality content, according to these principles, they may be removed or blocked from joining the YouTube Partner Program. Other videos that fall under the low-quality principles may receive limited or no advertising. Initially, YouTube says it will start with videos that encourage negative behavior. Others that have a strong focus on low-quality “made for kids” content will also go under review, the company added. These negative principles were already factors that determined if the content is appropriate for YouTube Kids and informed the larger YouTube algorithm. But monetization changes are a much more powerful tool to shape what sort of content creators actually produce. YouTube says creators whose channels could be impacted by the monetization changes will receive an email before the changes go into effect. In addition, even those channels that aren’t immediately impacted but produce low-quality kids’ content may receive a yellow icon in a warning to advertisers. The company didn’t say how many channels may be impacted as a result of its new policy. On the flip side, content that adheres to high-quality principles will be recommended more by the YouTube algorithm going forward, in addition to being included in the YouTube Kids app. The high-quality principles include things like content that encourages kids to be a good person; content that encourages learning and curiosity; content focused on creativity, play and a sense of imagination; content that focuses on interaction with real-world issues; and content that promotes diversity, equity, and inclusion. The announcement arrives on the heels of an increased examination of the role tech companies are playing when it comes to the well-being of minors using their services.

The organization […]","Zero Gravity While space travel is slowly becoming slightly more accessible, there are still a lot of hurdles to overcome — especially for would-be astronauts who are physically disabled. That could be starting to change as well, now that a nonprofit called AstroAccess launched a parabolic flight — a planes that flies in large arcs to simulate zero gravity — last Sunday that included 12 disabled passengers, The New York Times reports. The purpose of the flight was to test how folks with disabilities could handle a zero gravity environment, and those onboard found the experience to be freeing, if a little odd. “It was legitimately weird,” Eric Ingram, and one of the passengers on the flight, told the NYT. Ingram uses a wheelchair due to a rare condition that impacts his joints, butthe flight gave him the opportunity to do things like stand for the first time ever. “Just the act of standing was probably almost as alien to me as floating in zero gravity,” he added. Easy Maneuverability Sawyer Rosenstein, another passenger, found that the flight allowed him even greater control over his body. Rosenstein, who is paralyzed from the waist down, wore a modified flight suit that included a strap to maneuver his legs. He discovered that the zero gravity environment allowed him to test his body’s full range of motion. His chronic pain also disappeared throughout the flight. “I was in control of myself and my whole body,” Rosenstein told the NYT. “It’s almost indescribable to have that freedom after having it taken away for so long.” Space for All AstroAccess was created in response to the prohibitively restrictive culture that typically accompanies spaceflight. For example, NASA has a history of only recruiting physically fit people — and for a long time, only white men — to its astronaut programs. While the agency has gradually started to recruit a more diverse array of astronauts, it still overlooks those with disabilities — even though there are arguments that can be made that disabled folks can be great astronauts.

As many white-collar employees have moved from offices to remote work, it has drawn into sharp focus just how ill-equipped many home setups are for hour after hour of Zoom calls. Even as sales of PCs and tablets saw a major spike in 2020, consumer electronics companies weren’t particularly swift to react — not especially surprising, as the timeline to bring products to market is long, with many unannounced products still in the pipeline. Arriving today, as a free update on compatible systems, macOS 12 Monterey (in part) introduces some key features introduced in an era of remote work — and life. And it’s likely not a coincidence that the new operating system arrives as Apple hardware, like the MacBook Pro and M1-powered iMac, is finally getting long-overdue upgrades to their camera and microphone setups. For Apple, that means FaceTime. The company is in a bit of peculiar position on the teleconferencing front, in that — unlike, say Microsoft or Google — it doesn’t have a business teleconferencing platform. Last year, Apple added the ability to host up to 32 people on a call, which certainly opens things up, but as it stands, there’s no “FaceTime for Business.” This is a friends and family deal. Apple’s video calling app gets some key upgrades this time around. The top of the list addition is SharePlay, which unfortunately has been delayed on desktop and is currently set for a release at some point later this fall. It’s also largely expected to arrive on the soon-to-drop iOS 15.1. The feature is effectively a built-in version of the watch-together features that rolled out last year for streaming services at the height of the pandemic. Image Credits: Apple The feature is custom made to support Apple’s own services TV+ and Apple Music, and will work with a handful of launch partners, including Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max, the NBA app, Twitch, TikTok, MasterClass, Zillow, Paramount+ and ESPN+. It’s a healthy cross section of services, but there are some bigger names that are notably absent, including Netflix, Amazon and Spotify. The feature effectively syncs up video and audio content, allowing users in the group to react to what they’re seeing/hearing in real time. Volume adjusts around speakers’ audio and playback is synced when a user plays/pauses/fast forwards/rewinds. Users will also be able to extend the feature onto a set with an Apple TV. Also new is a share screen feature, similar to what you’ll find on a service like Zoom, letting you present windows to other viewers on the call. Spatial Audio comes to FaceTime, as well. I recently tried it out while testing the latest AirPods and dug the feature, which uses the position of a speaker’s window to place their audio in that approximate location. It’s a little gimmick for now, but it’s a neat one. One of the most interesting additions this time out is the ability to join a FaceTime call outside of the Apple ecosystem. Functionality is still limited, but users can create a link, which others can join on Android or Windows devices, through the Chrome or Edge browser. Users don’t need an account to join the call, but someone needs to let them in after clicking the link. Image Credits: Brian Heater Also new is Portrait Mode — which, again, works similarly to the blur background function we’ve seen on the leading teleconferencing services. Apple says the addition uses the Neural Engine found on the M1. Both this feature and Spatial Audio are only available on systems with the M1 chip, though the blurring of the line the new chips represent for developers seems to point to an acceleration in the adoption of iOS features on macOS. This is a nice change from the days of waiting a couple of updates to see mobile features hit the desktop. Once again, Safari receives some of the biggest updates here, along with its rethink on mobile. The biggest aesthetic change is a fairly radical move away from the universal search bar. The new “compact tab bar” moves tabs into small, discrete windows as a space saver. Given how much of a pain such a change can be, Apple is smartly leaving this something you can enable or disable in settings. Understanding that this is currently a browser tab world and we’re just living in it, Tab Groups lets users share them in bunches, so you can, say, have a “work” or “home” collection. Depending on how you work, that’s either a boon to creativity or another opportunity to cram a bunch of bookmarks away. Highlighting and right clicking text on a page now lets you add a “Quick Note,” collating all of that information into a single place. It’s a nice addition for those who do a lot of online research. Focus, which was announced as part of iOS 15, let’s you mediate distractions based on activities or times of day. You can, say, limit notifications when you’re meditating, reading, working, etc. These settings are automatically synced across Apple devices. Silenced notifications will also be noted in your messenger app, so people know when you don’t want to be disturbed. AirPlay to Mac is a long-awaited new feature that, well, does what it says on the tin, effectively letting you cast music, movies and the like to a Mac using AirPlay 2. Makes sense, particularly if you’ve got an iMac and a perfectly good screen and speakers. Universal Control — one of the more eagerly awaited additions here — is also coming later in the fall. The feature will further blur the line between iPadOS and Mac, letting users drag and drop items between the two for a more seamless AirDrop experience. The two devices can also be controlled by the same peripheral simultaneously, including a keyboard, trackpad or mouse. The other big addition here is Shortcuts, the latest feature to be ported over from iOS. The app is effectively replacing long-time favorite Automator, which will be going away at some point in the future. As it stands, shortcut is simpler but may ultimately lack the sophistication of Automator, so Apple is cushioning the blow by letting users convert Automator sequences into Short Cuts. It will keep Automator around for a while, however, as it solicits feedback from users. MacOS Monterey is available now for iMacs from 2015 and older, iMac Pro 2017 and later, MacBook Air/Pro early-2015 and later, Mac Pro 2013 and later, Mac mini 2014 and later and MacBook early-2016 and later.",2021-10-25 17:25:25,"The last year and a half has been a major eye opener for countless industries.

Blue Origin unveils plans for future commercial space station called Orbital Reef,https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744526/blue-origin-space-station-orbital-reef-announcement,,['Loren Grush'],,,"An artistic rendering of Orbital Reef with one of Boeing’s Starliner vehicles visiting. | Image: Blue Origin Jeff Bezos’ spaceflight venture Blue Origin announced plans to build its own free-flying space station today. Called Orbital Reef, the future space station will begin operating in the second half of this decade, according to Blue Origin, providing a place for researchers, industrial and commercial customers, and international partners to visit and work. Blue Origin is working on the Orbital Reef project in partnership with spaceflight company Sierra Space, a subsidiary of the Sierra Nevada Corporation. Sierra Space’s most well-known project is the Dream Chaser, a winged spaceplane designed to carry cargo — and perhaps people one day — to the International Space Station. Dream Chaser is scheduled to begin cargo flights in 2022. Blue Origin says that Orbital Reef also has the backing of additional spaceflight teammates, including industry heavyweight Boeing, as well as Redwire Space, Genesis Engineering Solutions, and Arizona State University. Orbital Reef will be able to house up to 10 people With an internal volume nearly as large as the International Space Station’s, Orbital Reef will be able to house up to 10 people, with separate areas for living and conducting science, according to Blue Origin. The company claims that Orbital Reef will be a “mixed-use business park” in space that will have multiple ports and berths for visiting spacecraft and modules, along with various utilities and amenities. Blue Origin boasts that the space station will have an “open system architecture” that will allow a variety of people and customers to use the facility. A list of possible users included space agencies, media and travel companies, entrepreneurs and investors, tech companies, and more, according to Blue Origin. Blue Origin also claims that it will provide “end-to-end” services for anyone wishing to use the station, from transportation, leasing space, technological assistance with hardware, and robotic services. “As the premier commercial destination in low Earth orbit, Orbital Reef will provide the essential infrastructure needed to scale economic activity and open new markets in space,” Blue Origin writes in a press release. Blue Origin has dropped hints in the past of its plans to potentially build a space station, and NASA is providing incentives for companies to pursue such projects. This year, NASA announced the creation of a new initiative called the Commercial Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Development — or CLD — program. The goal is to provide spaceflight companies with money to help jumpstart the development of private space stations that NASA could visit one day. NASA plans to award up to $400 million through two to four Space Act Agreements to fund initial studies of these space stations. Blue Origin has dropped hints in the past of plans to build a space station The CLD program is just one step in NASA’s long-term plan to eventually phase out the government-run International Space Station and transition to the use of commercial space stations. Currently, the ISS is slated to continue operating through 2024, and NASA has been eyeing an extension of the program through 2028. But the ISS is expensive, costing NASA $3 to $4 billion to operate each year, and the decades-old station can’t last forever. Eventually, NASA wants to retire the station and fill low Earth orbit — the domain of the ISS — with company-run space stations, as NASA focuses its human spaceflight efforts on deep space destinations. In September, NASA claimed it got about a dozen proposals for the initiative. “We got an incredibly strong response from industry to our announcement for proposals for commercial, free fliers that go directly to orbit,” Phil McAlister, the director of commercial spaceflight at NASA, told CNBC. “I can’t remember the last time we got that many proposals [in response] to a [human spaceflight] contract announcement.” NASA leadership has been considering this kind of future for many years. NASA already holds a contract with one company, Axiom, to develop a private space station that can dock with the ISS as part of a previous space agency initiative called NextSTEP. Axiom plans for this docked space station to be a precursor to a free-flying space station sometime later. Right now, Blue Origin’s only operational spaceflight project is New Shepard, a suborbital tourist rocket designed to send paying customers to the edge of space and back. So far, the company has flown eight people to space on New Shepard, including Bezos, Blue Origin’s founder. Other projects in development include New Glenn, a rocket designed to take cargo and people to orbit, as well as Blue Moon, a lunar lander that could take humans to the Moon’s surface. Neither of those projects has been completed yet. Blue Origin hoped to win a contract with NASA to develop Blue Moon for the agency’s Artemis program — an initiative to send humans back to the lunar surface — but the company ultimately lost out to rival SpaceX. In response, Blue Origin filed a lawsuit in the US Court of Federal Claims in an attempt to receive NASA funding for the project. Meanwhile, Blue Origin is grappling with its own internal strife. This month, nearly two dozen current and former employees at the company wrote an essay claiming that Blue Origin’s culture is toxic and unsafe.",2021-10-25 16:02:14,,,theverge,True,"[('Orbital Reef', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('Boeing', 'ORG'), ('Blue Origin', 'ORG'), ('today', 'DATE'), ('the second half of this decade', 'DATE'), ('Blue Origin', 'ORG'), ('Blue Origin', 'ORG'), ('Sierra Space', 'PERSON'), ('the Sierra Nevada Corporation', 'ORG'), ('Sierra Space’s', 'PERSON'), ('the Dream Chaser', 'ORG'), ('one day', 'DATE'), ('the International Space Station', 'ORG'), ('2022', 'DATE'), ('Blue Origin', 'ORG'), ('Orbital Reef', 'PERSON'), ('Boeing', 'ORG'), ('Redwire Space', 'PERSON'), ('Genesis Engineering Solutions', 'ORG'), ('Arizona State University', 'ORG'), ('up to 10', 'CARDINAL'), ('the International Space Station’s', 'ORG'), ('Orbital Reef', 'PERSON'), ('up to 10', 'CARDINAL'), ('Blue Origin', 'ORG'), ('Orbital Reef', 'PERSON'), ('Blue Origin', 'ORG'), ('Blue Origin', 'ORG'), ('Blue Origin', 'ORG'), ('Earth', 'LOC'), ('Orbital Reef', 'PERSON'), ('Blue Origin', 'ORG'), ('Blue Origin', 'ORG'), ('NASA', 'ORG'), ('This year', 'DATE'), ('NASA', 'ORG'), ('LEO', 'ORG'), ('CLD', 'ORG'), ('NASA', 'ORG'), ('one day', 'DATE'), ('NASA', 'ORG'), ('up to $400 million', 'MONEY'), ('two to', 'CARDINAL'), ('Blue Origin', 'ORG'), ('CLD', 'ORG'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('NASA', 'ORG'), ('International Space Station', 'FAC'), ('ISS', 'ORG'), ('2024', 'DATE'), ('NASA', 'ORG'), ('2028', 'DATE'), ('ISS', 'ORG'), ('NASA', 'ORG'), ('$4 billion', 'MONEY'), ('each year', 'DATE'), ('decades-old', 'DATE'), ('n’t', 'GPE'), ('NASA', 'ORG'), ('Earth', 'LOC'), ('ISS', 'ORG'), ('NASA', 'ORG'), ('September', 'DATE'), ('NASA', 'ORG'), ('about a dozen', 'CARDINAL'), ('Phil McAlister', 'PERSON'), ('NASA', 'ORG'), ('CNBC', 'ORG'), ('NASA', 'ORG'), ('many years', 'DATE'), ('NASA', 'ORG'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('Axiom', 'ORG'), ('ISS', 'ORG'), ('Blue Origin’s', 'ORG'), ('New Shepard', 'ORG'), ('eight', 'CARDINAL'), ('New Shepard', 'LOC'), ('Bezos, Blue Origin’s', 'ORG'), ('New Glenn', 'GPE'), ('Blue Moon', 'ORG'), ('Moon', 'PERSON'), ('Blue Origin', 'ORG'), ('NASA', 'ORG'), ('Blue Moon', 'ORG'), ('Artemis', 'NORP'), ('Blue Origin', 'ORG'), ('the US Court of Federal Claims', 'ORG'), ('NASA', 'ORG'), ('Blue Origin', 'ORG'), ('This month', 'DATE'), ('nearly two dozen', 'CARDINAL'), ('Blue Origin’s', 'ORG')]"

Take a look a Microsoft’s long-standing mobile phone ambitions. Even a $7.2 billion acquisition of the once-dominant Nokia couldn’t buy the company a place at the table with Apple and Samsung. Some earlier false starts aside, Google’s mobile hardware ambitions have been — on the whole — more successful. But the Pixel line has never had the major hit the company needs to justify the resources spent on the category. The devices have largely felt like, at best, a showcase for some of the cool stuff Google is working on in mobile software and ML and, at worst, a kind of also-ran. It’s frankly been strange to see the company struggle to make waves, though entering a field as crowded as smartphones was never going to be easy. And it’s doubly difficult to make a dent when, on the whole, flagship smartphones are all pretty good and continued dominance in the space is largely the result of forward momentum. Adding to Google’s troubles is a long-standing insistence that the true breakthroughs are all happening on the software side. It’s an interesting thesis, to be sure, that Apple, Samsung and the like are essentially wasting their time waging a war of specs. There’s something to the idea, but in its current state, at least, it’s simply not possible to be hardware agnostic. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are, undoubtedly, growing in importance, but camera lenses, displays and processors all still matter. At least for now. Last May, it was revealed that key members of the Pixel team had left the company. It was part of a big rethink, one reaching back even further. This August, CEO Sundar Pichai noted that the company has been working on its own in-house silicon for four years. As far as Hail Mary passes go, weaning yourself off chipmakers like Qualcomm is a big one. And it needs a big phone to go with it. Released this time last year, the Pixel 5 was the last vestige of the old way. Big changes don’t happen overnight — or even in a year when it comes to major electronics product lines. Unfortunately for Google, news of its minor restructuring got out ahead of the phone’s release, and even the company had to acknowledge that better days were ahead. The Pixel 6 isn’t make or break for the line, but after generations of uninspiring sales, it needs to prove that things are heading in the right direction. And by those standards, the phone is a rousing success. Image Credits: Brian Heater It stands in opposition to Google’s spec agnosticism as a testament that great software still requires great hardware. The Pixel 6 isn’t a cutting-edge, overclocked spec machine, by any stretch, but it stands as an example of what Google’s ever-impressive software can do when given the proper hardware. From the moment you grab the Pixel 6 Pro, it’s clear there’s something different here. The handset feels more like something produced by Samsung than of its Pixel predecessors. It’s got a size and a heft reminiscent of the Galaxy line, an aesthetic quality only enhanced by the curved glass edges. One of the things that honestly surprised me most the day of the announcement was how polarizing curved glass is in the online community. Here, its usage is primarily aesthetic, rather than attempting to jam in any kind of edge functionality, à la Samsung. The biggest argument I’ve heard against it is the risk of accidentally triggering the touchscreen when picking up the phone by the sides. It’s not a problem I’ve encountered, and honestly, I’m fairly curved screen-agnostic on the whole. Image Credits: Brian Heater The 6 Pro display is 6.7 inches, a QHD+ (3120 x 1440) OLED at 512 ppi. It’s nice, big and bright, with a max refresh rate of 120 Hz. The standard 6 sports a 6.4-inch display at 411 ppi and 90 Hz. You can’t really go wrong either way, but the Pro is a nice upgrade on that front. The front-facing camera is a pinhole design, obscured by the default wallpaper. There’s also an in-screen fingerprint reader at the bottom, which unlocks the phone quickly. The display is covered with Gorilla Glass Victus, with Gorilla Glass 6 on the rear. The upper-third of the back is monopolized by a large, distinct camera bar. I like it from a design standpoint — it’s a nice change from the standard square the competition has all gravitated toward. It’s a significant bump, which means the phone sits at an angle while on its back. The addition of the standard case largely negates this effect, however. The one other concern with the camera placement is that you may have to be a bit more mindful of where you place your hands while shooting in landscape mode. Again, I didn’t run into any issues on that front, and if you do, it’s easily corrected. [gallery ids=""2222899,2222903,2222904,2222894,2222895,2222893,2222896,2222897,2222898,2222900,2222902,2222905""] There’s a slight color difference in the glass above and below the camera bar. It’s really just a fun little flourish — something the company did with the power buttons on older Pixel units. It’s clear Google is still working to develop to distinguish itself from the lookalike competition. Thankfully, it’s just a subtle touch. The whole of the design language tastefully rides the line between boring and outlandish. The camera system is probably the ultimate example of how good software and hardware play off each other. I was testing the Pixel 6 Pro at the same time as the Surface Duo, and particularly in mixed or low light, it really was night and day (so to speak), in spite of the Microsoft device having a solid camera rig. Turns out developing your own camera system for several generations pays dividends. I really liked the shots I was able to capture on this thing. The 4x optical zoom on the Pro is a nice touch, as well. It can go up to 20x digital, but even with Google’s computational photography, you start to introduce noise into the image quickly. In addition to the standard suite of Pixel camera features comes some cool new tricks. Magic Eraser is similar in principle to Photoshop’s Content Aware Fill tool. Rub your finger on top of an unwelcome background image and it will use the surrounding settings to fill up the spot, effectively “erasing” the object. It’s far from perfect. A close look will generally spot the inconsistencies, and the more complex the surroundings, the worse job it does, generally. Even so, it does an impressive job for a new feature built into the app. Ditto for Action Pan. This works similarly to Portrait mode, adding a faux blur effect to the background of an object. It works well with larger, more geometrically simple objects like a car. Something like a person riding by on a bike, on the other hand, gives it more trouble around the edges — much like Portrait. Long Exposure is effectively the opposite, blurring the moving objects, while keeping the background stationary. Not gonna lie, my hermetic pandemic lifestyle hasn’t afforded me the opportunity to shoot many humans. Top of the list there are Face Unblur, which cleverly uses two cameras and face detection to create a composite sharper image on a moving object. We’re going to be digging into the real tone feature a bit deeper soon, but it’s a much welcome effort to better capture a wide range of skin tones. This, again, relies on facial detection, which can occasional be an issue. Also impressive are the slate of text tools arriving on the Pixel. Live translate worked will in my limited testing, and is an impressive addition to texting. Assistant voice typing works well, though it ran into occasional issues (perhaps my annunciation), including the addition of emojis via voice. All welcome addition to existing features like Recorder, which has since added German and Japanese to the mix. Image Credits: Google The real star of the show is Tensor, of course. Google has joined an increasing number of companies that have eschewed Qualcomm’s silicon dominance, in favor of their own chips. This one was four years in the making, and probably as good a sign as any that the company is committed to the Pixel line for the foreseeable future. This time out, the company credits the first-party SoC with powering a number of the new features core to the Pixel 6 experience. It notes in a recent blog post, With Google Tensor, we’re unlocking amazing new experiences that require state of the art ML — including Motion Mode, Face Unblur, Speech enhancement mode for videos and applying HDRnet to videos (more on these later). Google Tensor allows us to push the limits of helpfulness in a smartphone, taking it from a one-size-fits-all piece of hardware into a device that’s intelligent enough to respect and accommodate the different ways we use our phones. In our Geekbench tests, the system scored a 1031 on single-core and 2876 on multi-core. That’s a dramatic improvement over the 574 and 1522 average we saw for the Pixel 5 — but keep in mind, that system sported a middling Snapdragon 765G process. Not exactly flagship material there. Compare that to the 1093 and 3715 you get with the Snapdragon 888-powered Samsung Galaxy S21, and it’s clear that Google’s in-house chip has a ways to go, in terms of sheer processing firepower. Things get even worse placed against the 1728 and 4604 we got in our iPhone 13 Pro testing. Image Credits: Brian Heater Battery was one of the biggest sticking points with earlier models, but Google has addressed that here, big time. The 6 and 6 Pro feature 4,614 and 5,003mAh batteries, respectively — representing a solid upgrade from Pixel 5’s 4,080mA. That, in turn, was a nice jump from the Pixel 4. Google says you should be able to get through 24 hours on a charge — I found I was at around 26 hours with moderate use, so good news on that front.

The post The New AirPods Are Much Better Than the Old AirPods appeared first on Gizmodo Australia.","Apple released its first-generation AirPods five years ago, and aside from a wireless charging upgrade, its design hasn’t changed since 2016. It’s a testament to the popularity of the product that Apple hasn’t needed to update them in so long, but redesigned AirPods are finally here, and while they may be missing features found on similarly priced earbuds today, they still deliver a fantastic experience when paired with Apple’s other hardware. Apple wasn’t the first company to get wireless earbuds out the door — Bragi’s Dash gets credit for that — but the Cupertino company did succeed in making the first wireless earbuds with a charging case that was convenient to carry, and wireless connectivity that wasn’t endlessly frustrating, thanks to its W1 chip, and later, the H1. It turned truly wireless earbuds from a niche product with lots of drawbacks to a consumer-friendly device that sold by the millions, and created a market that has since exploded. As a result, the latest AirPods aren’t charting a new course like the originals, but instead introduce some much-needed refinements and improvements on an already incredibly popular product. Are they worth the upgrade? That depends. Apple AirPods (2021) WHAT IS IT? The first major redesign of Apple's AirPods that borrows features and design elements from Apple's AirPods Pro. PRICE $US179 ($239) LIKE Excellent sound (despite the lack of eartips); incredibly comfortable to wear for hours; quick access to Siri; H1 chip makes connectivity seamless DISLIKE No active noise cancellation; lack of eartips could make the fit feel off for some A Pro-Inspired Design It doesn’t take much detective work to figure out where Apple found its inspiration for the AirPods’ redesign. The earbuds look and feel almost identical to the AirPods Pro — minus the swappable silicone tips. The third-gen AirPods are a little smaller than the AirPods Pro, which makes sense given that they lack active noise cancellation hardware, and can also get away with a smaller battery without that feature. The new AirPods not only feature shorter stems than the older generation AirPods, they also replace the tap functionality with a force sensor on the stem that you squeeze to activate playback controls. I’m still not a fan of having to touch my wireless earbuds for any reason, particularly buds that aren’t held securely in place by extra wings or silicone tips, because I find it tends to easily dislodge them. While the squeeze functionality works adequately if you’re someplace you can’t talk, having the ability to just ask Siri to skip tracks or adjust the volume is just so much easier than having to squeeze something, and it remains a big selling point for Apple’s AirPods for iPhone users. I’ve always struggled to keep the original AirPods in my ears, to the point where I skipped them altogether and waited for the AirPods Pro to arrive. But I have a much easier time keeping the new AirPods in place, even during light physical activities like going for a walk. They’re actually ever so slightly heavier than the original AirPods, but the shorter stem combined with a more streamlined design that puts the main speaker at a better angle feels like it offers better weight distribution. Would I trust them staying in place during a jog or a competitive game of squash? Absolutely not. I’ll still be reaching for my AirPods Pros for more physical activities, but I find the fit considerably better on the new AirPods. The new AirPods’ charging case also looks more like the AirPods Pro’s case, and while not quite as wide, it is slightly taller. But as with every AirPods case, it still easily slides in and out of a pocket thanks to a smooth polished finish. MagSafe on Everything I’ll admit that when Apple revealed that the new AirPods charging case would support the company’s MagSafe feature, I scratched my head as to what that meant. Would the new AirPods attach to the back of my iPhone for easy access? Could I stick them to the fridge for safe-keeping? It turns out, while you can’t attach a tiny card wallet to the back of the AirPods charging case, it will do the same thing the iPhone 12 and 13 models do when dropped onto a MagSafe-compatible wireless charging pad. The case will perfectly align itself with the charging coil, and magnetically secure itself to the pad, so it’s almost impossible to accidentally knock it off during a charge. It works great, and is especially useful given how small the wireless receiver on the AirPods charging case is. Apple also added the feature to the AirPods Pro’s charging case last week, which makes sense. As far as I’m concerned, magnets should be added to the Qi standard and be included with every wireless charging product. If you don’t want to go wireless, you can also charge the case with a cable, but it’s beyond me why in the year 2021 companies are still putting anything but USB-C charging ports on their devices. For charging the AirPods via its port, you’ll still need to keep a Lightning cable on hand. Impressive Sound I’m just going to come out and say it: I am not a fan of the how the first- and second-gen AirPods sound. I respect them for helping wireless earbuds become a popular consumer product, but I’ve always thought they sounded flat and disappointing. But the new AirPods? I actually find myself reaching for them over my AirPods Pro, which surprises even me. Do they sound better than the Pros? No (nor will they ever without silicone tips directing sound right into my ear canals), but I’m legitimately surprised at how good they do sound. Apple advertises its new AirPods as having “a custom driver and high dynamic range amplifier that together produce rich consistent bass with crisp, clean high frequencies.” That really comes across when comparing the third-gen AirPods with older ones. The bass performance is very good, with a satisfying thump when the beat drops in tracks like the Tropic Remix of Surf Mesa’s “ily” at around the 30-second mark, but without completely muddling up higher frequencies. The separation between high and low frequencies isn’t as pronounced and distinct as it is with the AirPods Pro and other wireless earbuds that use silicone tips — sometimes the highs get a little lost if bass notes are really thumping in a track — but the new AirPods’ sound quality is a huge improvement, and because they’re so comfortable to wear, I keep choosing them over my AirPods Pro for most of my daily listening. Premium Apple-Centric Features When all I care about is enjoying my music, I reach for the Master & Dynamic MW08, which I still think are the best-sounding wireless earbuds you can buy. The rest of the time, I use Apple’s AirPods because of how well integrated the wireless earbuds are with the other Apple hardware I rely on. Bluetooth simply isn’t the best option for streaming audio (though one day it will be), and Apple’s H1 chip makes up for most of its shortcomings and delivers an impressively polished and smooth experience when using AirPods with iPhones. It sounds trivial, but Apple addressing the problems with Bluetooth is still one of the best reasons to choose the AirPods. Being able to ask Siri to carry out simple playback functions without having to tap or squeeze anything is incredibly useful, as is the AirPods’ integrations with Apple’s Find My network, and being able to use an iPhone (and the strength of the Bluetooth connection) to pinpoint each buds’ nearby location should they end up lost between the couch cushions. As for the Spatial Audio feature that Apple continues to push with its headphones? It was created to provide a surround sound-like experience using just a pair of speakers — which in this case is the wireless bud in each of your ears. It can not only make audio cues sound like they’re coming from different directions, like the multitude of speakers in a movie theatre do, but it can also lock the audio in space, so even if you turn your head, the source of the sound always sounds like it’s coming from the same location. It’s a clever use of motion sensors and genuinely works, but I don’t think it will ever be the reason someone chooses Apple’s earbuds over the competition’s. When I’m on a group FaceTime call all I care about is getting off that group FaceTime call, not being able to acoustically differentiate where everyone is located on screen. It’s a feature Apple is pushing because it certainly differentiates the AirPods line, but it’s also a feature that helps Apple justify the AirPods’ price, and I don’t really think it’s as much a killer feature as Apple wants it to be. Let’s Talk About the Price The most surprising reveal for the new AirPods last week was the price tag. At $US179 ($239), they’re $US20 ($27) cheaper than the second-gen AirPods, but waiting five years for a complete redesign means that the new AirPods face stiff competition today. Not every pair of wireless earbuds on the market today offers active noise cancellation, and its omission just means that Apple plans to continue with the AirPods Pro — that’s fine. But for less than $US100 ($133), you can now get a pair of wireless earbuds that sound great, are easy to wear, and offer ANC. Earbuds like the Nothing Ear (1) don’t offer the same level of streamlined connectivity as the AirPods, but Apple’s Beats Studio Buds also offer ANC, use the same H1 chip as the AirPods, and can be had for $US150 ($200) — about $US30 ($40) cheaper. Does that mean the new AirPods are a pass? Not at all. They’re a fantastic upgrade in every way, and for those who hate having silicone tips crammed into their ear canals (I’ve been using them for decades and even my ears still get sore after prolonged use), the new AirPods are incredibly comfortable to use while still providing amazing sound quality — something I didn’t really think was possible. I’ve been wearing them around the house for entire days since they arrived, and of all the wireless earbuds I’ve tested over the years, nothing comes close to how comfortable these feel. If you’re an OG AirPods devotee, then you’ve probably already got a pair preordered and on the way. If you’ve been holding out for reviews to see if they’re legitimately a solid upgrade, the answer is a definitive yes — they’re better than the old AirPods by far. But if you’re considering an AirPods upgrade and want to prioritise features like sound quality and noise cancellation over your earbuds playing nice with Apple’s hardware ecosystem, there are now many other excellent AirPods alternatives to treat your ears if you’ve got $US180 ($240) to spend.

Braze set to put points on the board for New York’s startup scene in impending IPO,https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/braze-set-to-put-points-on-the-board-for-new-yorks-startup-scene-in-impending-ipo/,"['Fundings & Exits', 'Startups', 'TC', 'braze', 'EC Newsletter', 'new york city', 'SaaS', 'software as a service', 'The Exchange']",['Alex Wilhelm'],,"Braze is growing nicely at scale with modest net losses and no smokescreen-y, fake profit numbers on display.","Welcome to the week! Sure, the technology and business worlds are busy digging through a deluge of Facebook-focused reporting ahead of the social media company’s earnings report, but we have other work to do. Namely, the Braze IPO filing. The New York City-based company focuses on customer engagement software. We’ll get into what that means in a little bit. The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. For background, Braze raised around $175 million while private, most recently raising a September 2018 round that put $80 million into its account and afforded Braze an $850 million post-money valuation. PitchBook and Crunchbase agree on the numbers. Our task this morning is to understand what Braze does, get our hands around its financial performance, and then chat a bit about what the company may be worth. Sound good? Let’s do it. What does Braze do? In broad terms, Braze links with customer software systems to collect consumer data, automatically sorting consumers into segments. From there, the company’s software can send “contextually relevant” notes to consumers, personalized based on what Braze has learned about the person or persons in question. Those messages can be sent both inside of customer products or outside through third-party channels. The underlying logic is that consumers expect customization today, and that data is the way to pull off the task. Braze makes lots of noise in its filing about how many companies’ customer data is siloed inside individual applications today. In contrast, Braze offers a method of centralizing consumer data, which, in theory, allows for a more holistic view of a customers’ consumer base. With that view in hand, customers can make better marketing decisions, with Braze helping companies get tuned messages out to end users. As you can imagine, we’re talking about a software-as-a-service product, though the company does have a dusting of on-demand revenues, which we’ll get to in the next section. Braze’s service has a large in-market footprint. The company claims in its S-1 filing that it powered “interactions with 3.3 billion monthly active users via our customers’ apps, websites and other digital interfaces in July 2021.” That figure was 2.3 billion in January 2020 and 1.6 billion in January 2019. How does that rising usage of the Braze platform translate into revenue? Let’s find out. Is that a good business? Braze is a pretty good business. The company has released data through the July 31, 2021, quarter. We should get an early look at its October 31, 2021, quarter in a following S-1 filing.",2021-10-25 15:44:59,,,techcrunch,True,"[('the week', 'DATE'), ('Braze', 'ORG'), ('New York City', 'GPE'), ('Exchange', 'ORG'), ('TechCrunch+', 'ORG'), ('Exchange', 'ORG'), ('every Saturday', 'DATE'), ('Braze', 'ORG'), ('around $175 million', 'MONEY'), ('September 2018', 'DATE'), ('$80 million', 'MONEY'), ('Braze', 'ORG'), ('$850 million', 'MONEY'), ('Crunchbase', 'ORG'), ('this morning', 'TIME'), ('Braze', 'ORG'), ('Braze', 'PERSON'), ('Braze', 'ORG'), ('Braze', 'ORG'), ('third', 'ORDINAL'), ('today', 'DATE'), ('Braze', 'ORG'), ('today', 'DATE'), ('Braze', 'ORG'), ('Braze', 'ORG'), ('Braze', 'ORG'), ('3.3 billion', 'CARDINAL'), ('monthly', 'DATE'), ('July 2021', 'DATE'), ('2.3 billion', 'CARDINAL'), ('January 2020', 'DATE'), ('1.6 billion', 'CARDINAL'), ('January 2019', 'DATE'), ('Braze', 'ORG'), ('Braze', 'ORG'), ('the July 31, 2021, quarter', 'DATE'), ('October 31, 2021,', 'DATE'), ('quarter', 'CARDINAL')]"
Eight things we learned from the Facebook Papers,https://www.theverge.com/22740969/facebook-files-papers-frances-haugen-whistleblower-civic-integrity,,['Russell Brandom'],,,"A massive new document release shows chaos and confusion inside the world’s most powerful social network For months, Facebook has been shaken by a steady leak of documents from whistleblower Frances Haugen, beginning in The Wall Street Journal but spreading to government officials and nearly any outlet with an interest in the company. Now, those documents are going much more public, giving us the most sweeping look at the operations of Facebook anyone not directly involved with the company has ever had. The documents stem from disclosures made to the SEC and provided to Congress by Haugen in redacted form. The Verge and a consortium of other news organizations have obtained redacted versions of the documents, which we’re calling The Facebook Papers. In order to receive the documents, we agreed to begin publishing our reporting on them this week, but we are not beholden to report on them in a certain way or coordinate what we cover with other outlets. We’ve already done some reporting on the files, and we’ll keep reporting on them over the coming weeks. (There are a lot of pages.) This isn’t a comprehensive list of everything in the documents, and you should fully expect more to come out. Instead, think of it as a summary of the files that, so far, have stood out to us the most. Hopefully, it will help you make sense of the sheer volume of Facebook news coming out this morning. Facebook was caught off guard by vaccine misinformation in comments Facebook has taken a lot of criticism for its handling of COVID misinformation — including from President Biden, who accused the platform of “killing people” by letting anti-vaxx sentiment run amok — but the leaks show just how chaotic the effort was inside the company. One document dated March 2021 shows an employee raising the alarm about how unprepared the platform was. “Vaccine hesitancy in comments is rampant,” the memo reads. “Our ability to detect vaccine-hesitant comments is bad in English, and basically non-existent elsewhere. We need Policy guidelines specifically aimed at vaccine hesitancy in comments.” (Editor’s note: We are not publishing the document itself since it contains the full name of a Facebook employee.) “Comments are a significant portion of misinfo on FB,” says another employee in an internal comment, “and are almost a complete blind spot for us in terms of enforcement and transparency right now.” “For English posts on Vaccines, vaccine hesitancy prevalence among comments is 50 percent.” The document makes clear that Facebook already had a “COVID-19 lockdown defense” project dedicated to the platform dynamics created by the pandemic, including a workstream dedicated entirely to vaccine hesitancy. That team had also created significant automated flagging systems for misinformation — but according to the files, those simply weren’t being used to downrank anti-vaccine comments. As of the March memo, there were no plans to develop moderation infrastructure like labeling, guidelines, and classifier systems to identify anti-vaccine statements in comments. The failure to meaningfully moderate comments was noticed outside the company. A First Draft News study in May looked at the comments for a handful of major news outlets with more than a million followers and found one in five comments on vaccine-related stories contained some kind of anti-vaccine misinformation. The documents show Facebook was aware of the problem, and First Draft may have even underestimated the issue. One comment on the post reads, “for English posts on Vaccines, vaccine hesitancy prevalence among comments is 50 percent.” Other aspects of the issue remained completely unstudied since the company had yet to dig in on the comment problem. “We currently don’t understand whether Group comments are a serious problem,” the post argues. “It’s clear to us that the ‘good post, bad comment’ problem is a big deal, but it’s not necessarily as clear that [vaccine hesitant] comments on [vaccine hesitant] posts are additive to the harm.” Another document published shortly after April 2021 shows the company still coming to terms with vaccine misinformation. The good news was that there was no evidence of a foreign influence campaign driving anti-vaxx sentiment, as had stung the company in 2016. But the vast majority of content was being sent by a relatively small portion of accounts, suggesting that Facebook had not yet taken the easiest measures to address the issue. Facebook has taken some steps recently to address misinformation in comments — including new downranking rules from just last week. But these documents show those changes came more than six months after the alarm had been raised internally and after Facebook had publicly expressed anxiety about the impending leak. Given the huge surge of COVID deaths among vaccine-skeptical populations over the past three months, it’s easy to see the recent changes as too little, too late. Apple threatened to ban Facebook over online “slave markets” Facebook scrambled to address human trafficking content after Apple threatened to kick its apps off the iOS App Store, a leaked SEV (or Site Event) report shows. The report, referenced briefly by The Wall Street Journal’s Facebook Files reporting, indicates that Apple threatened to pull Facebook and Instagram from iOS on October 23rd of 2019. Apple had been tipped off by a BBC News Arabic report that found domestic workers being sold via Instagram and other apps, where sellers encouraged buyers to mistreat the workers by doing things such as confiscating their passports. the policy was “highly likely leading to exploitation of domestic servants” Facebook had been aware of the problem but hadn’t understood the scope of it, apparently because very little content (less than 2 percent of the material it found) had been reported by users. “Removing our applications from Apple platforms would have had potentially severe consequences to the business,” the Facebook report notes. After Apple escalated the issue, Facebook moderators swept the platforms for keywords and hashtags mentioned in the BBC reporting, ultimately disabling 1,021 accounts and removing 129,121 pieces of content. Facebook also removed a policy exception letting established brick and mortar businesses like recruitment agencies post ads about domestic workers. Facebook determined that even if the businesses were legal, the policy was “highly likely leading to exploitation of domestic servants.” Apple was apparently satisfied with the mitigation measures, and the incident was closed within a week. The Civic Integrity team was often directly blocked by Zuckerberg One of the most alarming incidents uncovered by the papers was that Mark Zuckerberg personally intervened to ensure Facebook would comply with a repressive law instituted in Vietnam, agreeing to moderate more aggressively against “anti-state” content on the platform. The anecdote leads The Washington Post’s report on the papers and plays into a much more troubling dynamic described by Haugen before Congress. Facebook’s Integrity team had lots of ideas for how to make Facebook less harmful, but they were usually overruled, sometimes by Zuckerberg himself. Bloomberg News explores the issue in more detail, showing how the company often found its own efforts to downrank harmful content overwhelmed by the content’s inherent virality. As one employee put it, “I worry that Feed is becoming an arms race.” Politico highlights another employee quote showing just how demoralized the team had become. “If we really want to change the state of our information ecosystem, we need a revolution, not an evolution of our systems,” an employee wrote in October 2019. “If you don’t have enough good content to boost, it doesn’t matter how much you downrank the bad.” Facebook used a German anti-vaccine movement as a test case for more aggressive moderation Another document details Facebook’s so-called “Querdenken experiment,” in which the company’s moderators tested out a more aggressive moderation approach on a German conspiracy movement. Facebook’s Dangerous Content team was already developing a new classification — a “harmful topic community” — and the growing Querdenken was chosen as an experiment on how the classification would work in practice. As a Facebook employee writes in the document, “this could be a good case study to inform how we tackle these problems in the future” “this could be a good case study to inform how we tackle these problems in the future” Querdenken has become one of the leading anti-lockdown and anti-vaccination groups in Germany, with similarities to more extreme groups like QAnon. As the Facebook proposal framed it, the Querdenken movement had potential for violence but wasn’t yet linked to extreme enough activity that would justify banning followers from the platform entirely. The documents give few details about how the experiment proceeded, although clearly, some version of the Querdenken plan was implemented. (A later report says “results from some initial samples look promising.”) And judging by the company’s public statements, it did result in a meaningful change to moderation policy: in September, Facebook announced a new policy on “coordinated social harm,” specifically citing Querdenken as an example of the new approach in action. Unlike many of the other documents, the Querdenken experiment shows Facebook’s moderation system as relatively effective. The company identified the group before it caused significant harm, took action with an eye towards long-term consequences and was transparent about the policy shift after it took place. But the incident shows how complex the interplay of policy and enforcement can be, with broader policies often rewritten with an eye towards specific groups. And for supporters of Querdenken, it may be alarming to learn that the rules of the world’s largest social platform were rewritten specifically to keep their movement from gaining public support. Facebook’s January 6th response was shaped by glitches and delays Facebook discussed developing extreme “break-glass measures” to limit misinformation, calls to violence, and other material that could disrupt the 2020 presidential election. But when former President Donald Trump and his supporters tried to stop successor Joe Biden from being declared president on January 6th, 2021, Facebook employees complained these measures were implemented too late or stymied by technical and bureaucratic hangups. Reports at Politico and The New York Times outline Facebook’s struggle to handle users delegitimizing the elections. Internally, critics said Facebook didn’t have a sufficient game plan for “harmful non-violating narratives” that toed the line between misinformation and content Facebook wants to preserve as free speech. And some plans, like a change that would have prevented Groups from changing their names to terms like “Stop the Steal,” apparently got held up by technical problems. Facebook was trying to rebalance its News Feed for “civic health” The Wall Street Journal first revealed that news outlets and political parties had complained about users favoring negative and hyperbolic content. Facebook was considering ways to fix the problem, and one method involved re-weighting the News Feed to optimize for “civic health” instead of primarily focusing on meaningful social interactions or session time. In a product briefing called “Ranking For Civic Health,” Facebook acknowledged that “people think that political content on Facebook is low quality, untrustworthy, and divisive,” and the current ranking system was “not creating a wholly valuable civic experience for users.” (Based on document comment dates, the document was produced around January and February of 2020.) “people think that political content on Facebook is low quality, untrustworthy, and divisive” The document says Facebook’s ranking algorithm recommended civic content that users themselves didn’t report finding valuable — something earlier leaks have indicated was a problem with meaningful social interactions (MSI) and other engagement-based metrics. “Our current ranking objectives do not optimize for integrity outcomes, which can have dangerous consequences,” it says — for instance, MSI optimization was “contributing hugely to Civic misinfo,” and Facebook estimated that removing it from Civic posts would decrease it by 30 to 50 percent. Facebook tried to improve civic health by asking users explicitly what they thought constituted good civic content. This sometimes revealed even bigger problems — since Facebook apparently found that 20 to 30 percent of respondents “may say that known Civic hate is ‘good for the community’” in surveys. Facebook settled on a strategy to “prioritize the reduction of policy-violating content — such as Civic Hate or Civic Misinfo — even if the individual user finds it valuable” and aimed to reduce the prevalence of civic hate speech, misinformation, and inflammatory content by at least 10 percent. The company ran rebalancing experiments in February 2020 by slightly increasing the amount of “civic” News Feed content that a random set of users saw, then optimizing that content through different metrics (including MSI and whether people thought content was “worth your time”). It also ran a survey to collect how users felt about civic News Feed content. The company aimed to have a new optimization system chosen by March of 2020 — although it’s not clear how the coronavirus pandemic may have changed those plans. Why likes were never hidden on Facebook and Instagram A highly publicized plan from early last year to hide like counts on Instagram never happened because testing the change hurt ad revenue and led to people using the app less. A quiet test of the experience on the Facebook app was also killed after leadership told Zuckerberg that it wasn’t a “top barrier to sharing nor a top concern for people.” A lengthy internal presentation to Zuckerberg about the plan, dubbed Project Daisy, shows that there were concerns among leadership about how the Facebook app would have been perceived if Instagram hid like counts and Facebook did not, which is something employees who were involved in the project have told The Verge. Employees working on Instagram wanted to bill it as a way to depressurize the app for young people, but the team working on the Facebook app wasn’t into the idea. If Instagram went through with hiding likes, the presentation details how leadership at Facebook wanted to “minimize blowback to the Facebook app” for not hiding them and still “ensure credit ladders up to the Facebook company.” Instead of hiding likes for all users by default as was originally planned, Instagram earlier adopted a half measure by letting people opt into hiding their likes. Facebook’s “civic groups” policy stumbled over a simple design flaw In October 2020, Facebook announced that it would stop recommending civic and political groups to users in the US as part of a broader effort to avoid the mistakes of the 2016 election. (The policy was made permanent shortly after the January 6th riot.) But actually keeping those groups out of Facebook recommendation feeds has been a huge challenge for the company — and an internal document gives us new insight into why. The document shows Facebook employees grappling with a public article, flagged by the PR team, which found 30 separate groups still appearing in recommendation feeds in apparent violation of the policy. Escalated on January 19th, the document says many of the groups named in the report had been labeled as civic groups at one point — but were somehow still being recommended as part of facebook’s Groups You Should Join feature. Reducing churn could have solved almost all of the problems “Leakage has been there since Nov 2020 at the least,” the Facebook document reads. It’s not clear which article the document is referring to, but there were a number of reports spotting enforcement failures at the time. The Markup found a bunch of groups slipping through that January and again in June. Even now, it’s not clear the civic groups policy is being enforced as intended. At the time, most observers focused on the conceptual difficulty: it’s a hard philosophical problem to draw a clear line between which groups count as “civic” and even harder to scale it across a platform of Facebook’s size. But the internal report shows the real problem was much simpler. Facebook’s monitoring system (referred to in the report as “Laser”) had been trained to only look at the past seven days of content when determining whether a page fell into the “civic groups” category, which meant pages were constantly filtering in and out as the period viewed by the algorithm changed. In practice, that meant a pro-Trump or pro-Biden group could easily dodge the label by posting a few days worth of less obviously political content. The report estimates that a full 12 percent of labeled groups would churn out of the category from day to day. According to the report, 90 percent of the groups highlighted by the article had been caught by Facebook’s existing “civic groups” classifier — but they’d filtered out as part of the churn. So reducing churn alone could have solved almost all of the problems spotted by the report. There have been lots of stories like this over the past five years: Facebook sets a policy that seems measured and responsible, but a cursory test (usually from a journalist) shows banned content is still easily slipping through. From the outside, it’s often unclear how much of the problem is incompetence at Facebook and how much is just the inherent difficulty of managing a platform of that size. But in this case, the documents put the blame squarely on Facebook as a company. This was a high-profile policy with huge stakes for the country at large, with obvious delicacy in how it was implemented. A churn rate that high made it inevitable that targeted groups would slip through the cracks, and the company simply didn’t notice until reporters called them out.",2021-10-25 15:40:19,,,theverge,True,"[('months', 'DATE'), ('Frances Haugen', 'PERSON'), ('The Wall Street Journal', 'ORG'), ('SEC', 'ORG'), ('Congress', 'ORG'), ('Haugen', 'GPE'), ('The Facebook Papers', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('this week', 'DATE'), ('the coming weeks', 'DATE'), ('this morning', 'TIME'), ('COVID', 'PERSON'), ('Biden', 'PERSON'), ('One', 'CARDINAL'), ('March 2021', 'DATE'), ('Vaccine', 'PERSON'), ('English', 'LANGUAGE'), ('English', 'NORP'), ('Vaccines', 'ORG'), ('50 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('March', 'DATE'), ('First', 'ORDINAL'), ('Draft News', 'ORG'), ('May', 'DATE'), ('more than a million', 'CARDINAL'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('five', 'CARDINAL'), ('First Draft', 'ORG'), ('One', 'CARDINAL'), ('English', 'NORP'), ('Vaccines', 'ORG'), ('50 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('Group', 'ORG'), ('April 2021', 'DATE'), ('2016', 'DATE'), ('just last week', 'DATE'), ('more than six months', 'DATE'), ('COVID', 'PERSON'), ('the past three months', 'DATE'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('App Store', 'PERSON'), ('SEV', 'ORG'), ('Site Event', 'ORG'), ('The Wall Street Journal’s', 'ORG'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('Facebook and Instagram', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('October 23rd of 2019', 'DATE'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('BBC News', 'ORG'), ('Arabic', 'LANGUAGE'), ('Instagram', 'ORG'), ('less than 2 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('BBC', 'ORG'), ('1,021', 'CARDINAL'), ('129,121', 'CARDINAL'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('a week', 'DATE'), ('Civic Integrity', 'ORG'), ('Zuckerberg', 'PERSON'), ('Mark Zuckerberg', 'PERSON'), ('Vietnam', 'GPE'), ('The Washington Post’s', 'ORG'), ('Haugen', 'ORG'), ('Congress', 'ORG'), ('Facebook’s Integrity', 'ORG'), ('Zuckerberg', 'PERSON'), ('Bloomberg News', 'ORG'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('Feed', 'PERSON'), ('Politico', 'PERSON'), ('October 2019', 'DATE'), ('German', 'NORP'), ('Facebook’s', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('German', 'NORP'), ('Querdenken', 'PERSON'), ('Querdenken', 'PERSON'), ('Germany', 'GPE'), ('QAnon', 'ORG'), ('Querdenken', 'PERSON'), ('Querdenken', 'PERSON'), ('September', 'DATE'), ('Querdenken', 'PERSON'), ('Querdenken', 'PERSON'), ('Facebook’s', 'ORG'), ('Querdenken', 'ORG'), ('January 6th', 'DATE'), ('2020', 'DATE'), ('Donald Trump', 'PERSON'), ('Joe Biden', 'PERSON'), ('January 6th, 2021', 'DATE'), ('The New York Times', 'ORG'), ('Facebook’s', 'ORG'), ('Groups', 'ORG'), ('Stop the Steal', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('News Feed', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('The Wall Street Journal', 'ORG'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('the News Feed', 'ORG'), ('Ranking For Civic Health', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('MSI', 'ORG'), ('MSI', 'ORG'), ('Civic', 'PRODUCT'), ('Civic', 'ORG'), ('30 to 50 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('20 to 30 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('Civic', 'ORG'), ('Civic Hate', 'ORG'), ('Civic Misinfo', 'PERSON'), ('at least 10 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('February 2020', 'DATE'), ('MSI', 'ORG'), ('March', 'DATE'), ('2020', 'DATE'), ('Facebook and Instagram', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('early last year', 'DATE'), ('Instagram', 'ORG'), ('Zuckerberg', 'PERSON'), ('Zuckerberg', 'PERSON'), ('Project Daisy', 'PERSON'), ('Instagram', 'ORG'), ('Instagram', 'ORG'), ('Instagram', 'PERSON'), ('Instagram', 'ORG'), ('half', 'CARDINAL'), ('October 2020', 'DATE'), ('US', 'GPE'), ('2016', 'DATE'), ('January 6th', 'DATE'), ('30', 'CARDINAL'), ('January 19th', 'DATE'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('facebook’s Groups You Should Join', 'ORG'), ('Nov 2020', 'DATE'), ('Markup', 'PERSON'), ('January', 'DATE'), ('June', 'DATE'), ('Facebook’s', 'ORG'), ('the past seven days', 'DATE'), ('pro-Biden', 'PERSON'), ('a few days', 'DATE'), ('a full 12 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('90 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('Facebook’s', 'ORG'), ('the past five years', 'DATE')]"

In addition, ESA astronaut Matthias Maurer will serve as a mission specialist on the mission. Launch time and how to watch The launch window opens at 2:21am EST (7:21am BST) on Sunday, October 31. The crew will liftoff on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Launch Complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The Crew Dragon Endurance is scheduled to dock to the space station at 12:10am EST (5:10am BST) Monday, November 1. Prelaunch activities, launch, and docking will air live on NASA Television, the NASA app, and the agency’s website. What is SpaceX? Here's what you need to know... SpaceX is a cash-flushed rocket company that wants to take man to Mars. It was set up by eccentric billionaire Elon Musk in 2002 and is based in Hawthorne, California. SpaceX’s first aim was to build rockets that can autonomously land back on Earth for refurbishment and re-use. The technology makes launching and operating space flights more efficient, and therefore cheaper. SpaceX currently uses its reusable Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets to fly cargo to the International Space Station (ISS) for Nasa. It also carries satellites and other space tech into orbit for various government agencies and multinational companies. The company took astronauts to the ISS for the first time in 2020. Other future missions involve carrying tourists to the ISS and astronauts to the Moon and Mars. Musk has repeatedly said he believes humanity must colonise Mars to save itself from extinction. He plans to get a SpaceX rocket to the Red Planet by 2027.

[+] together - Friendship, empowering, teamwork, partnership and youth lifestyle concept getty Oh, if they can only get you hooked at a young age. That’s the goal with Big Tech companies like Facebook, who hope to get teenagers obsessed with an app like Instagram and slowly move them over to a much bigger platform like Facebook someday, according to an internal doc and a recent profile of Instagram users . Using the word “pipeline” in an internal doc reveals what we all know already about social media companies. They are bating teens with a friendly app, one that doesn’t focus as much on links and ads, in hopes that they will keep looking for other platforms as they get older. Sound familiar? The worry, according to the report, is that Instagram isn’t quite the gateway drug for social media as it once was. The report makes it clear: “In a survey this year from the financial services firm Piper Sandler, 35 percent of teenagers said Snapchat was their favorite social media platform, with 30 percent saying TikTok. Instagram was third with 22 percent.” Instagram currently enjoys a large populace of about 1.3 billion users. None of us really know or understand what lures in the teen population, since even Gen-Z don’t seem to know. We do know that every young generation is drawn to what is new and shiny (although, guess what — so are middle-aged and older people). Should we be worried that Facebook uses a word like pipeline ? Yes, we should. The reason it’s a bit alarming is that it reveals how much they view these apps as part of a strategic marketing campaign to host more ads, not so much as useful tools to help us communicate and discover new things. MORE FOR YOU A New Clubhouse Feature Aims To Increase Small, Private Chats—And Deeper Engagement Facebook Admits It Reported Faulty Numbers To Advertisers, Blames Apple AOC’s ‘Tax The Rich Dress’ – Ultimate Fashion Statement Or Display Of Hypocrisy If we were talking about highly productive apps meant to enrich our lives and make us feel more connected, as Facebook often states, then the internal docs would not talk about something that sounds suspiciously like a sales funnel. What it would sound like instead is more like a real product. Improving the experience, making information easier to find. The word pipeline is the same one you might expect a car dealership to use. The conversation might go like this: The boss to his sales employee: “So where is that customer in the pipeline?” Salesperson: “They seem to be kicking the tires.” Boss: “Let’s see if we can entice them a little more with a warranty or other perk, okay?” It all starts to seem like rats in a maze, except the cheese is all about likes, shares, and reactions, and the maze runs on your phone. For the last few years, and especially once the movie The Social Dilemma debuted on Netflix, experts have started telling us that Facebook and Instagram are like slot machines. You pull down on the screen in Instagram to see new rewards. You check Facebook to see your likes. Now, knowing there is a pipeline involved, it seems like social media firms have decided that Instagram is the initial hook — the pull-tabs at the bar, perhaps. Teens eventually “graduate” to the bigger slot machines of Facebook and Twitter. At least, that’s the hope they have. Catch them young, reel them in.

So a wave of central banks around the world are now producing their own digital currencies. In a groundbreaking move for the African continent, buffered by local activity and interest in cryptocurrency — after the U.S., it is the second-largest market for crypto trading — Nigeria joins that list this week. After being in the development phase for the last three years, its central bank is piloting the first digital currency in Africa today. It joins 14 other countries now in the pilot stages with their own central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), including China, Sweden and South Korea, with a total of 81 countries in other stages of exploring CBDCs. Only five have fully launched them: the Bahamas, Grenada, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda, and Saint Lucia. The virtual money, dubbed the eNaira, is backed and issued by the country’s apex bank, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). Like most governments, Nigeria is introducing a virtual currency because they are more cost-efficient than physical cash, help the unbanked have easier access to money, and can, in some way, limit illicit activities. But despite the advantages that come with central bank-issued digital currencies, there are fears of the threats it poses in the hands of some governments who have a track record of surveilling or attempting to surveil their citizens. What we know so far about eNaira Heading up to this pilot launch, the apex bank picked Barbados-based Bitt Inc in August to develop and roll out the digital currency. The company has a track record: It assisted the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU) to design and launch DCash, the digital currency used by Antigua and Barbuda, Grenada, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Saint Lucia — four of the five countries that have fully launched their own CBDCs. On September 27, the CBN launched the eNaira website, detailing necessary information on how Nigerians can access and use the virtual currency. First, Nigerians will have to download the eNaira mobile application on the Apple Store or Play Store. They can also opt to scan a QR code on the website to access the service. After registration, users must register and create a wallet — called the Speed Wallet — to store, send and receive money. Several tiers of wallets are available on the platform catering to various users with or without bank accounts and different identification levels. The website lists four main eNaira features: a unified payment system that allows customers to move money from their eNaira wallet; a bank account management feature that lets users check balances and transaction history; a contactless payment service so users can make in-store payments by scanning QR codes; and P2P payments in which users send money to each other via a linked bank account or card. Cryptocurrency to give way to CBDCs Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin highlight the potential of money’s digital future despite being created outside the confines of the traditional global banking system. And its sharp rise in adoption has led to a scuffle with legacy institutions in determining the future of money. The argument against cryptocurrencies has typically focused on concerns around fraud and volatility. That hasn’t stopped some countries, like El Salvador, from using bitcoin as a legal tender. For others that see bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as a threat to their national banking and financial systems, CBDCs act as direct replacements for rising interest in something other than fiat. “The concept of CBDCs has become a necessity for central banks. Money is a tool for controlling people. They do not want to allow the primary tool of control to be eroded because the entrance of privately-issued cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum is a direct challenge to central banks’ authority everywhere in the world. CBDCs come in as their response, albeit weak ones,” Chimezie Chuta, founder and coordinator of Blockchain Nigeria User Group, told TechCrunch. While cryptocurrencies are pretty independent, digital currencies hold the same value as their paper counterparts. In Nigeria’s case, the eNaira will be pegged to the naira, with its value fluctuating against the dollar, just as the naira does. Another significant difference between CBDCs and cryptocurrencies is that the former is subjected to regulation and control — common themes at the heart of governments in China and Nigeria. Since 2014, China has been working on a national digital currency (digital yuan), an effort championed by its central bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), a year after the Chinese government banned banks and payments companies from providing bitcoin and cryptocurrency-related services. In 2017, China banned mining, initial coin offerings (ICOs) and cryptocurrency trading platforms from converting legal tender into cryptocurrencies and vice versa. But despite the bans, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have gained significant traction in the Asian country since then, so it made tighter laws this May by banning fintech companies from offering services around account openings, registration, trading, clearing and settlement to crypto platforms. China says all cryptocurrency-related transactions are illegal and must be banned Up until now, China had targeted only local crypto platforms and had not barred individuals from holding cryptocurrencies in offshore exchanges. But that changed last week when the Chinese government declared all transactions involving cryptocurrencies [including mining] illegal. It also stated that it was illegal for offshore crypto exchanges like Binance to provide services to people in mainland China. “Whilst this is not a surprise as China has ‘banned’ crypto many times in the past, this time there is no ambiguity,” PwC crypto leader Henri Arslanian tweeted. “Crypto transactions and crypto services of all kinds are banned in China. No room for discussion. No grey area.” Some analysts have said these bans and restrictions by China are geared towards the Asian country’s full release of the digital yuan in 2022. That’s plausible, despite the Chinese government’s claims that it launched the digital yuan to replace some cash in circulation in a country where WeChat and Alipay are responsible for four out of five payments carried out digitally. More crypto crackdown and surveillance? The PBOC, with the help of the government, might be attempting to take back some online payments market share from the duopoly (Alipay and WeChat) with the digital yuan, whose trials and rollout started from April 2020 in Shanghai, Chengdu and Beijing. Like the eNaira, users can only access the digital yuan by downloading a mobile app developed and controlled by the central bank. So far, there are over 7 million individual digital wallets and 1 million company wallets using the digital yuan. Transactions totaling $5.3 billion have been made from the trials, according to Business Insider. China’s digital yuan tests leap forward in Shenzhen Although Nigeria isn’t a crypto mining country, its people are heavy crypto users. The West African country is second only to the U.S. for bitcoin trading, according to Paxful, as many Nigerians use the cryptocurrency to protect their savings against naira depreciation. In May, Nigerians traded $2.4 billion worth of traceable crypto, per data from Chainalysis. It’s an astonishing figure considering that in February, the Nigerian government via the CBN banned cryptocurrency transactions, prohibited banks from taking part in such transactions, and ordered them to close accounts of Nigerians using cryptocurrency. And, similar to China, Nigeria’s following action tilted towards piloting its digital currency. But unlike China, Nigeria is a cash-dominated society. It’s one of the main reasons (including the potential to improve financial inclusion) why smaller countries such as the Bahamas have rolled out their digital currency. For these purposes, the introduction of a digital currency in Nigeria does make sense on paper. However, many Nigerians have reservations about its usefulness, while others understand that it’s the government’s ploy to reduce incentives for people who want to use crypto. But then, there are other subtle factors to be worried about: surveillance and a full-scale crackdown on crypto activities in the country. Typically, governments use Financial Intelligence units to monitor financial transactions and collect information on suspicious or unusual monetary activity. But CBDCs might take things up a notch. Several publications have alluded that China’s government could use the digital yuan to advance surveillance of its people. According to its central bank, the PBOC, agencies operating digital yuan services are expected to “submit transaction data to the central bank via asynchronous transmission on a timely basis,” which will allow the bank to “track data and crackdown on laundering and criminal offenses.” The CBN has a similar objective and has said before that the eNaira will minimize fraudulent activities and money laundering because of the “trackable unique ID of each eNaira.” “Banks and telcos already have our necessary information via verification processes,” said Chuta. “But CBDCs will increase that monitoring and surveillance because now they can actually follow money flow in a digital environment and carry out a forensic analysis of each user’s transaction on the ledger that they are deploying.” In June, a report from a local press said Nigeria was in talks with China to build an internet firewall. According to the publication, China’s “Great Firewall” is the center of the government’s online censorship and surveillance effort. And though Nigeria lacks the resources to build such a firewall for surveillance, some believe the eNaira might have been designed for the same purpose, albeit on a lesser scale. “CBDCs are trackable and I think it might come in handy for the government if they decide to carry out unwarranted surveillance,” said a crypto user, who withheld his name, to TechCrunch. Also, as with the case of China, more crypto crackdowns could be triggered if, for instance, the adoption of eNaira does not take off as planned or if the government enforces the eNaira as the sole digital currency to be traded in the country. Case in point: China’s new orders made two of the world’s largest crypto exchanges — Huobi and Binance — halt new registrations for users, and Huobi says it will retire current accounts by the end of the year. It’s unclear if the Nigerian government can exercise such powers. Still, should it ban offshore crypto platforms from servicing and employing Nigerians and succeed, peer-to-peer activities (which has made crypto thrive in Nigeria) will take a severe hit. “The government, in general, poses a threat to crypto. It’s situations like this where someone has real-world power and [can] put you in jail for trading crypto,” said a growth lead at a Nigerian cryptocurrency exchange platform. “If a government really decided to outlaw the use of crypto within their borders, crypto would be stifled such that at some point, it might not be worth it to use anymore.” At the moment, though, it seems Nigeria and its apex bank have noble intentions with the eNaira. According to the CBN governor Godwin Emefiele, the eNaira will lead to cheaper and faster remittance inflow and increase cross-border trade. For the former, the eNaira is assumed to provide a better alternative for Nigerians in the diaspora to send money home, in the long run, increasing remittances into the country, which reached $17 billion last year. News about Chinese banks expanding operations in Nigeria made the rounds last month and could prove pivotal to the effectiveness of cross-border trade between both countries. China is Nigeria’s biggest trade partner (volume transacted between them has passed $20 billion this year, increasing from $19.2 billion in 2020). Three years ago, both countries tried a currency swap agreement for better trade and although nothing materialized, Chuta holds that the countries’ digital currencies can act as perfect substitutes. “I think there can be interoperability that can be beneficial to both countries. When you want to transfer money from Nigeria to China, you would have to go through at least four different hops and it takes like three or four days,” said Chuta. “But let’s say China and Nigeria’s CBDCs interoperate, it means that if I want to send money to a Chinese supplier, I simply swap eNaira to Chinese yuan on my app and push it to the supplier who gets it at a fraction of the amount I would’ve typically done with the traditional transfer bodies.” According to Nigeria’s central bank, the eNaira would also improve “payment efficiency, revenue and tax collection, and targeted social interventions.” Will Nigeria’s apex bank achieve all this? It’s too early to say since no country, either in pilot or fully launched mode, has achieved success at a massive scale yet. The eNaira’s staggered rollout is expected to take place across four cities in the country — Port Harcourt, Abuja, Kano and Lagos. But given how similar government-led initiatives have fared in the past, the odds of achieving full-scale rollout are slim.",2021-10-25 15:03:16,,,techcrunch,True,"[('African', 'NORP'), ('U.S.', 'GPE'), ('second', 'ORDINAL'), ('Nigeria', 'GPE'), ('this week', 'DATE'), ('the last three years', 'DATE'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('Africa', 'LOC'), ('today', 'DATE'), ('14', 'CARDINAL'), ('China', 'GPE'), ('Sweden', 'GPE'), ('South Korea', 'GPE'), ('81', 'CARDINAL'), ('Only five', 'CARDINAL'), ('Bahamas', 'GPE'), ('Grenada', 'GPE'), ('Saint Kitts', 'GPE'), ('Antigua', 'PERSON'), ('Barbuda', 'PERSON'), ('Saint Lucia', 'PERSON'), ('eNaira', 'ORG'), ('the Central Bank of Nigeria', 'ORG'), ('CBN', 'ORG'), ('Nigeria', 'GPE'), ('eNaira Heading', 'ORG'), ('the apex bank', 'ORG'), ('Barbados', 'ORG'), ('Bitt Inc', 'ORG'), ('August', 'DATE'), ('Eastern Caribbean Currency Union', 'ORG'), ('ECCU', 'ORG'), ('Antigua', 'PERSON'), ('Barbuda', 'GPE'), ('Grenada', 'GPE'), ('Saint Kitts', 'GPE'), ('Saint Lucia', 'PERSON'), ('four', 'CARDINAL'), ('five', 'CARDINAL'), ('September 27', 'DATE'), ('CBN', 'ORG'), ('eNaira', 'ORG'), ('Nigerians', 'NORP'), ('First', 'ORDINAL'), ('Nigerians', 'NORP'), ('eNaira', 'ORG'), ('the Apple Store', 'ORG'), ('four', 'CARDINAL'), ('eNaira', 'ORG'), ('eNaira', 'ORG'), ('El Salvador', 'GPE'), ('Chimezie Chuta', 'PERSON'), ('Blockchain Nigeria User Group', 'ORG'), ('TechCrunch', 'ORG'), ('Nigeria', 'GPE'), ('eNaira', 'ORG'), ('naira', 'GPE'), ('naira', 'GPE'), ('China', 'GPE'), ('Nigeria', 'GPE'), ('2014', 'DATE'), ('China', 'GPE'), ('digital yuan', 'ORG'), ('the People’s Bank of China', 'ORG'), ('a year', 'DATE'), ('Chinese', 'NORP'), ('2017', 'DATE'), ('China', 'GPE'), ('Asian', 'NORP'), ('May', 'DATE'), ('China', 'GPE'), ('China', 'GPE'), ('last week', 'DATE'), ('Chinese', 'NORP'), ('Binance', 'GPE'), ('China', 'GPE'), ('China', 'GPE'), ('Henri Arslanian', 'PERSON'), ('China', 'GPE'), ('China', 'GPE'), ('Asian', 'NORP'), ('the digital yuan', 'ORG'), ('2022', 'DATE'), ('Chinese', 'NORP'), ('the digital yuan', 'ORG'), ('Alipay', 'PERSON'), ('four', 'CARDINAL'), ('five', 'CARDINAL'), ('Alipay', 'PERSON'), ('the digital yuan', 'ORG'), ('April 2020', 'DATE'), ('Shanghai', 'GPE'), ('Chengdu', 'GPE'), ('Beijing', 'GPE'), ('eNaira', 'ORG'), ('the digital yuan', 'ORG'), ('over 7 million', 'CARDINAL'), ('1 million', 'CARDINAL'), ('the digital yuan', 'LAW'), ('$5.3 billion', 'MONEY'), ('Business Insider', 'ORG'), ('China', 'GPE'), ('digital yuan', 'ORG'), ('Shenzhen', 'GPE'), ('Nigeria', 'GPE'), ('West African', 'NORP'), ('second', 'ORDINAL'), ('U.S.', 'GPE'), ('Paxful', 'ORG'), ('Nigerians', 'NORP'), ('naira', 'GPE'), ('May', 'DATE'), ('Nigerians', 'NORP'), ('$2.4 billion', 'MONEY'), ('Chainalysis', 'GPE'), ('February', 'DATE'), ('Nigerian', 'NORP'), ('CBN', 'ORG'), ('Nigerians', 'NORP'), ('China', 'GPE'), ('Nigeria', 'GPE'), ('China', 'GPE'), ('Nigeria', 'GPE'), ('Bahamas', 'GPE'), ('Nigeria', 'GPE'), ('Nigerians', 'NORP'), ('Financial Intelligence', 'ORG'), ('China', 'GPE'), ('the digital yuan', 'ORG'), ('CBN', 'ORG'), ('eNaira', 'ORG'), ('eNaira', 'ORG'), ('Banks', 'PERSON'), ('Chuta', 'ORG'), ('June', 'DATE'), ('Nigeria', 'PERSON'), ('China', 'GPE'), ('China', 'GPE'), ('Nigeria', 'GPE'), ('eNaira', 'ORG'), ('TechCrunch', 'ORG'), ('China', 'GPE'), ('eNaira', 'ORG'), ('eNaira', 'ORG'), ('China', 'GPE'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('Huobi', 'GPE'), ('Binance', 'GPE'), ('Huobi', 'ORG'), ('the end of the year', 'DATE'), ('Nigerian', 'NORP'), ('Nigerians', 'NORP'), ('Nigeria', 'GPE'), ('Nigerian', 'NORP'), ('Nigeria', 'GPE'), ('apex bank', 'ORG'), ('eNaira', 'ORG'), ('CBN', 'ORG'), ('Godwin Emefiele', 'PERSON'), ('eNaira', 'ORG'), ('eNaira', 'ORG'), ('Nigerians', 'NORP'), ('$17 billion', 'MONEY'), ('last year', 'DATE'), ('Chinese', 'NORP'), ('Nigeria', 'GPE'), ('last month', 'DATE'), ('China', 'GPE'), ('Nigeria', 'GPE'), ('$20 billion', 'MONEY'), ('this year', 'DATE'), ('$19.2 billion', 'MONEY'), ('2020', 'DATE'), ('Three years ago', 'DATE'), ('Chuta', 'ORG'), ('Nigeria', 'GPE'), ('China', 'GPE'), ('at least four', 'CARDINAL'), ('three or four days', 'DATE'), ('Chuta', 'ORG'), ('China', 'GPE'), ('Nigeria', 'GPE'), ('Chinese', 'NORP'), ('eNaira', 'ORG'), ('Nigeria', 'GPE'), ('eNaira', 'ORG'), ('Will Nigeria’s', 'PERSON'), ('eNaira', 'ORG'), ('four', 'CARDINAL'), ('Port Harcourt', 'GPE'), ('Abuja', 'GPE'), ('Kano', 'PERSON'), ('Lagos', 'GPE')]"

U.S. retail giants Home Depot and Best Buy have pulled the Chinese video surveillance technology makers Lorex and Ezviz from their stores over links to human rights abuses. In a statement to TechCrunch, Home Depot said it’s “committed to upholding the highest standards of ethical sourcing and we immediately stopped selling products from Lorex when this was brought to our attention.” Best Buy said it was “discontinuing its relationship” with both Lorex and Ezviz. Lowe’s, which did not comment, also removed Lorex from its shelves following inquiries from TechCrunch and video surveillance news site IPVM. Lorex is a subsidiary of Dahua Technology, and Ezviz is a video surveillance camera brand owned by Hikvision. Dahua and Hikvision, both headquartered in China, were added to the U.S. government’s economic blacklist in 2019 after the companies were linked to China’s ongoing efforts to suppress ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, where most Uighur Muslims live. The U.S. government says Beijing relies heavily on Hikvision, Dahua and other technology companies to supply the surveillance equipment to surveil the Uighur population. The Biden administration called the human rights abuses in Xinjiang a “genocide,” and blamed Chinese video surveillance manufacturers of having “been implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China’s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups.” United Nations watchdogs say Chinese authorities have detained over a million Uighurs in internment camps in recent years. China has long denied the allegations. But as the sanctions neither cover Dahua and Hikvision subsidiaries like Lorex and Ezviz and don’t apply outside the federal government, consumers are still broadly free to buy the technology. Until last week, Lorex listed on its website Home Depot, Best Buy, Lowe’s, Walmart and Costo as its five authorized national retail outlets. When reached for comment, a Lorex spokesperson said: “Lorex is fully transparent with our retail partners about our ownership and have been since the acquisition in 2018. We are also regularly in touch with representatives of those companies in regard to various regulatory and compliance issues, including addressing any questions they have about the FCC’s proposed rulemaking.” Lorex did not respond to follow-up emails after its products were removed. Lorex removed the logos of the five retail giants from its website, though it still lists the companies — except Walmart — as retailers of its technology.

Snap shed more than 20% of its value after telling investors that it expects a far smaller fourth quarter than the street anticipates. Privacy changes to technology platforms and weak advertiser demand thanks to supply-chain issues are likely to weigh on Snap’s Q4 top-line expectations. Facebook stock fell around 5% on the Snap news on Friday. And then Facebook had a difficult weekend of coverage, a period that flowed into a Monday-morning news dump concerning the company as dozens of media organizations began reporting on a trove of documents released by a whistleblower. Facebook is in the midst of what is perhaps its most damning reporting cycle to date, a bit of a high-water mark given the social company’s history of scandal. This morning, however, shares of Facebook are essentially flat, trading up or down 0.2% to 0.3%. Investors are shrugging off the reporting, it appears. It would be easy to make a somewhat cynical comment that public-market investors were more concerned about potentially lackluster business results than they are about, say, the company’s inability to handle misinformation and political manipulation in India. But a good chunk of today’s reporting deals with things that do matter in business terms, like Facebook’s slowly declining grip on younger users. So, what’s going on? It may be that today’s reporting was priced into Facebook’s stock already; the company, worth just under $326 per share this morning, is far from its all-time high of $384.33 that it set earlier this year, indicating that it has already given up quite a lot of value. But it may be most fair to say that Facebook investors are simply reacting to new disclosures — like Snap’s bad news — more than historical documents outlining longer-term issues. That would explain why Facebook fell Friday and is flattish today. Regardless of why Facebook’s shares are holding steady this morning, any gains in the wake of an ocean of negative reporting based on the company’s own descriptions of its problems — leaked documents are powerful for that very reason — must feel like a win inside of Facebook’s halls.

The deal, which will push the car rental giant’s EV offerings to 20% of its global fleet, is reportedly worth $4.2 billion, according to sources cited by Bloomberg. Tesla Model 3 vehicles will show up in the Hertz rental as early as next month in major U.S. markets and select cities in Europe, according to the rental company. The order will likely represent a notable portion of Teslas manufactured and delivered over the next 14 months. The EV maker delivered 499,550 vehicles in 2020, with the vast majority of these being its most popular Model 3 sedan. Production and deliveries have risen this year. Tesla delivered 627,572 through the first three quarters of 2021. The company produced around 624,582 vehicles in that same 9-month time period. Hertz also announced plans to install thousands of chargers throughout its network to support the increase in EVs, in addition to a “premium and differentiated rental experience” for customers renting a Tesla that includes educating drivers on how to use and charge the car. Customers who rent a Tesla Model 3 will also have access to Tesla’s supercharging stations, infrastructure that is already under pressure in some locations as sales of the Tesla EVs skyrocket. Tesla shares rose more than 5% following the news, pushing the stock price to $960 shortly after the market opened. Hertz stock also saw an 11% increase, to around $27. Like other companies in the travel and tourism industry, Hertz had a rocky pandemic, with decreased rentals pushing the company to file for bankruptcy protection in May last year.

The Future Of Blockchain In Healthcare,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/10/25/the-future-of-blockchain-in-healthcare/,"['Innovation', '/innovation', 'Innovation', '/innovation', 'technology']","['Jose Morey', ' Forbes Councils Member']",,"While many exciting and creative blockchain solutions have emerged from pioneering companies around the world, this is only the beginning.","While many exciting and creative blockchain solutions have emerged from pioneering companies around the world, this is only the beginning.",2021-10-25 14:30:00,"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Chief Executive Officer of Ad Astra Media and Chief Health Officer of Ever Medical Technologies. getty One of the biggest buzzwords being thrown around the field of medical technology is “blockchain.” This is for good reason. Simply put, blockchain holds the potential to revolutionize healthcare. With its full deployment, patients can be truly focused on at the center of all operations, which in turn will also be entirely overhauled with better security, privacy and accessibility. But how exactly does blockchain enable all this? How is the health industry fully utilizing this vastly capable cutting-edge technology? What Is Blockchain? First, let’s dive deeper into what blockchain really is. A blockchain is a distributed system that generates and stores data records. It maintains a digital ledger of connected “blocks” of information that represent how data is shared, changed or accessed on its peer-to-peer network. All devices on the same blockchain system will generate identical blocks when a connected device is involved in any kind of transaction. If one computer’s data is accessed, changed, shared or otherwise manipulated in any way, a block is generated to locally record that information on every device. This way, changes to data can be easily identified. It’s a decentralized approach that allows data parity to be achieved by comparing every connected device’s blocks. MORE FOR YOU Google Issues Warning For 2 Billion Chrome Users Forget The MacBook Pro, Apple Has Bigger Plans Google Discounts Pixel 6, Nest & Pixel Buds In Limited-Time Sale Event On top of simply recording and comparing data is the utilization of “hashing.” Hashing gives every block a unique identifier that changes based on its contents. If a block’s data were to change, so would its hash. This is important because blocks are stored together in chronological order and also directly reference the preceding block’s hash. Therefore, trying to change the data of one block would immediately cause a succeeding block to identify a hash change. It is for this reason that connected blocks form a “chain” securely wrought in an immutable, reliable, decentralized manner. Accurate, secure and a catalyst for utmost accountability, blockchain makes it almost impossible to mimic, manipulate or otherwise falsify data. This opens the doors to many possibilities — chief of all being the exchange, storage and access of data between connected parties. How Blockchain Is Affecting The Medical Industry Being open and highly secure means blockchain can be applied to the medical industry in a variety of ways, leading to immensely reduced costs and new ways for patients to access healthcare. Combined with the compounding nature of data and innovation, futureproofing technologies can be further applied to foster an era of growth and innovation. Already, pioneering companies are laying the foundations for a blockchain revolution. Here’s how they’re transforming the medical industry. Chronicled The medical industry has suffered greatly from the inability to securely share and access sensitive patient data. Blockchain, however, will facilitate finely customizable openness while upholding only the best security standards for true interoperability. In turn, this will allow health information systems to work together within and across organizational boundaries in order to advance the effective delivery of healthcare for individuals and communities. Chronicled utilizes blockchain technology in its MediLedger Network to bring together trading partners and medical institutions closer than ever before. Without the constant threat of communicative and organizational mishaps, room for much greater innovation and industry development has been created. From the automation of once-hectic processes to greater accountability from all parties, blockchain enables a new world of trust and collaboration. Curisium Acquired in 2020 by HealthVerity, Curisium employed blockchain to create a platform for rebate negotiation and contract management. Everyone in healthcare knows how complex contract negotiations can get, not just in discussion but in how time-consuming and cumbersome they can be. By creating a system that streamlines this process, Curisium allows providers and payers to take part in innovative contracting arrangements that are efficient and secure. All in all, HealthVerity’s acquisition has resulted in the extensive customization and seamless automation of workflows to enable expanded opportunities for collaboration and cost-savings across all parties. Ever Built from the ground up with the goal of fostering innovation, Ever, where I serve as the chief health officer, has an EHR solution that can be quickly and readily applied even to existing hospital networks. Connecting over 170 hospitals and 5 million patients, the Ever Network provides an integrated but modular suite of software that features secured and trustless data exchanges, big data collection and analysis, and machine-learning/artificial intelligence-powered tools and features. Established in 2017, Ever has modernized and equipped Thailand’s medical landscape with a blockchain, data-driven, patient-centric network. It enables best-in-class security for all connected data and parties while maintaining close and easy communication with trusted parties — all on a flexible, future-proof, scalable blockchain foundation. Patientory Blockchain networks let organizations establish transparency and privacy alike, helping to conceal sensitive patient data while allowing access and sharing when needed. Protected by state-of-the-art security solutions, attackers would require vast computational capabilities to even attempt targeting a blockchain-powered network, severely limiting the frequency, possibility and effectiveness of attacks. Patientory leverages this advantage in the development of patient-centric applications and services, giving the company more control over their well-being. Up-to-date patient histories and data, pandemic tracking and reporting, secure communication with verified healthcare personnel and much more are a reality with their slew of innovative solutions. A Future Alight With Innovation One of the most exciting aspects of blockchain technology is the foundation of growth and modularity that it provides. Though its initial implementation will face the same limitations as today’s technology, blockchain’s open nature will encourage and support industry-wide advancement for years to come. In fact, BIS Research has revealed estimated reports that the immediate application and integration of blockchain in healthcare could save more than $100 billion per year in costs related to IT, operations, support functions, personnel and health data breaches by 2025. While many exciting and creative blockchain solutions have emerged from pioneering companies around the world, this is only the beginning. Join the transformation today and help push the boundaries of medical technology — all while laying the foundations for a data-driven future that will drive medical breakthroughs at an unprecedented scale.

The solutions, which are a part of Alexa Smart Properties, are designed specifically to meet the needs of deploying Alexa devices at scale and will allow the facility’s administrators to create customized experiences for their residents or patients. In senior living centers, the residents would be able to use Alexa devices to call their family members and other loved ones, as well as keep up with the goings-on at their community and other community news. The devices could also be used to make announcements, allow the residents to communicate with each other through direct audio messages, make voice and video calls, and they can streamline other center activities — like check-ins, maintenance requests, and various administrative tasks. Amazon believes this could help make facilities more efficient and productive. Amazon says senior living communities include Atria and Eskaton will integrate with its new solution. The market for using Alexa in senior living communities was already being explored by third-party providers, like K4Connect, which last year closed on $21 million in Series B funding to bring newer technologies, including Alexa’s voice assistance, to older adults and those living with disabilities. Companies like K4Connect and others, including Lifeline Senior Living, Aiva, and Vocera, can now tap into Alexa Smart Properties’ tools and APIs to make it easier for them to roll out their own, customized solutions and software. Image Credits: Amazon Meanwhile, Amazon had already piloted putting Alexa in patient rooms in a test with Cedars-Sinai, which allowed patients to use voice commands for performing basic tasks, like changing TV channels, as well as communicating with caregivers. The idea was that, by offloading some of the everyday tasks to Alexa, it could free up nurses to focus more on medical care. With Amazon’s new solution for hospitals, patients will be able to use Alexa to communicate with care staff, control the devices in their room, and stay entertained with news and music. Healthcare providers can also communicate with their patients using Alexa features like calling and Drop-In, without having to enter the patient rooms. This could also help hospitals be more productive and conserve their medical supplies and protective equipment like gloves, masks, and gowns, notes Amazon. (PPE shortages had been an ongoing issue in some locations as Covid spiked during the pandemic.) Cedars-Sinai is among those officially rolling out the Alexa Smart Properties solution, following its pilot program, and is joined by BayCare and Houston Methodist, Amazon says. “Voice is intuitive for patients, regardless of age or tech-savviness,” said Peachy Hain, executive director of Medical and Surgical Services at Cedars-Sinai, in a statement. “Since it’s so easy to operate, patients can use Alexa to connect with their care team and stay entertained as soon as they settle in, while care providers can streamline tasks to make more time to care for those patients. It’s a total gamechanger for enhancing our hospital experience,” Hain added. Though Amazon has struggled with privacy issues related to its use of voice recordings and transcriptions, the healthcare and senior living center solutions will not save the voice recordings and don’t require users to share personal info with Alexa to use the device, the company explains. Users can also mute the Echo’s microphone at any time with the button on top. Amazon also claims it safeguards protected health information received through HIPAA-eligible Alexa skill interactions. Amazon has been working to bring Alexa to healthcare facilities for some time. A report in 2018 by CNBC had said the company was building out a healthcare team with Alexa in order to make the voice assistant useful in the industry. This included working through the complex HIPAA regulations that would be required to do so. The following year, Amazon announced its first HIPAA-compliant medical skills and began piloting its devices in hospitals. Elsewhere across Amazon, the company has invested in healthcare solutions in other ways, including through solutions like Amazon Comprehend Medical, a machine learning tool that gathers information from things like doctors’ notes and patient health records, and acquisitions like online pharmacy PillPack.

As a result, Silicon Valley has built itself up as the global tech center. Today, it employs hundreds of thousands of high-tech workers and is home to 10 of California's 14 Fortune 500 companies, according to the Silicon Valley Business Journal.

However, the last decade has seen cloud providers like AWS create the systems to give even individual developers access to the kind of infrastructure that was only available to companies the size of Microsoft 10 years ago. These platforms also offer powerful new software development tools that dramatically cut down development times via the use of readily available APIs, etc. Also, communication tools that were once customer-oriented have now become business-orientated, meaning that businesses located in the furthest corners of the globe can increasingly gain access to business messaging apps such as Slack, conference rooms such as those provided by Zoom or Microsoft Teams, and worker performance monitoring applications such as Monday. These tools allow developers, designers, managers and product owners to work as an effective team despite the fact they have never physically even met one another. Silicon Valley was also the driving force behind the creation of the online learning platforms that have empowered people from all over the world to be able to gain the skills and access to the funding that allows them to become remote software developers and the next generation of startup founders. One of the foremost examples of companies that helped to bake this new layer of innovation is Y Combinator. It now offers a free startup acceleration course that teaches entrepreneurs how to begin and manage their own startups. Added to this, it also provides access to funding to make it happen. To date, Y Combinator has invested in over 2,000 companies, including as Airbnb, Stripe, Dropbox and Reddit. The combination of these forces means that Silicon Valley's ""cat"" is out of the box and there is no way back. New Internet Unicorns Will Be Built Remotely There is another part of Silicon Valley's success that is also eating away at it. A mix of skyrocketing property prices and salaries had already begun to cause an exodus from Silicon Valley of both companies and workers even before the Covid-19 pandemic hit. The pandemic caught most companies off guard and has served as a catalyst in accelerating a change in work practices and business environments that was already well underway. Zapier is one example of a company already operating the business model of tomorrow. It relies entirely on remote office work rather than any headquarters or office. Its model meant that it experienced little to no disruption when the Covid-19 pandemic forced countries and states into lockdown. It's now valued at $5 billion and continues to grow in 2021. As a result of the pandemic, numerous other companies scrambled to follow suit and initiate policies that asked their workers to work remotely. For example, Dropbox and Coinbase announced that they would become remote-first companies. Following big tech, more and more Silicon Valley startups have taken notice of this trend, realizing they don't need to actually even be located in Silicon Valley with its high real estate prices, salaries and infrastructure strains. Instead, many have already begun opting for the remote work approach in order to streamline costs while reaping the benefits of access to the global talent pool. PwC, Gallup and the NCBI have provided some extremely useful and eye-opening insights into integrating a remote work approach into businesses. Conclusion The bottom line is that we can expect this trend to continue tearing down the status quo of Silicon Valley in the coming decade. In regard to the software development industry, the future ""unicorns"" should be built entirely by remote teams that are managed by remote workers. It may sound like an ""extravaganza"" now, but let's reevaluate this in 10 years. The sooner you follow this trend, the higher the chances should be for your business to thrive in the future. It's a bittersweet taste for Silicon Valley. From one perspective, it fulfilled the dream to spread innovation and technology across the globe. Yet Silicon Valley itself looks to be fading in the process. Forbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

Further Reading For lunar cargo delivery, NASA accepts risk in return for low prices ""We got through the critical design review process in eight months, which is a very fast pace for sending something to the surface of the Moon,"" William Coogan, Blue Ghost's chief engineer, told Ars. The lander is sized like a large person, about 2 meters tall, and capable of carrying 155 kg of payload to the Moon's surface. From the time that NASA ordered the mission, Firefly will have had about 2.5 years to design and build the lander, Coogan said. He is most excited about the spacecraft's potential to stream high-definition video from the surface of the Moon at 10 megabits per second. One camera, at the top of the spacecraft, will be set to track to Earth as it moves over the Moon, and its eclipse as it sets over the horizon. Coogan said he is eager to share such a view of our home planet with the entire world. Advertisement To date, NASA has selected six missions as part of the innovative commercial lunar payload program. The first two of these, built separately by Astrobotic and Intuitive Machines, may launch in 2022. If Blue Ghost holds to its production schedule, it should be the third or fourth private US mission to land on the Moon. Firefly started as a launch company and attempted its first Alpha rocket launch in early September. The rocket failed after one of its first-stage engines shut off only seconds after launch, but the company is already well on its way toward a second attempt, said CEO Tom Markusic. The company plans to deliver hardware for its second flight to the launch site at Vandenberg Space Force Base in December and may attempt a launch as early as January 2022. The company's rocket production process is strongly vertically integrated, so developing Blue Ghost has been a challenge in that it relies more heavily on external partners, Markusic said. For example, the spacecraft's engines are being built by a Ukrainian company, Flight Control . And the supply chain issues that have struck other industries have hit the aerospace sector as well. Enlarge / The Blue Ghost team is shown in front of actual-size spacecraft models. Firefly Aerospace ""I'd say the supply chain is my biggest concern, but it’s not a serious concern,"" Markusic said about Blue Ghost's scheduled launch and lunar landing. ""The way we’ve mitigated that is we’ve picked good partners and we’ve watched them carefully. Overall I feel good."" Although he began Firefly to launch rockets, Markusic said he has realized that to scale in the space industry, a company needs to do more than launch. SpaceX, for example, has diversified beyond launch with its Dragon spacecraft and Starlink satellite businesses. So in addition to developing a larger ""Beta"" rocket and the Blue Ghost lander, Firefly is also working on an in-space utility vehicle. The privately held company completed a round of Series A funding earlier this year and aims to raise an additional $100 million or more by the first quarter of 2023 to fund its ongoing development activities.",,arstechnica,True,"[('Firefly', 'ORG'), ('Moon', 'PERSON'), ('Firefly Aerospace', 'ORG'), ('Firefly Aerospace', 'ORG'), ('only a few weeks', 'DATE'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('Texas', 'GPE'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('Firefly', 'PERSON'), ('Monday', 'DATE'), ('the ""Blue Ghost', 'PRODUCT'), ('Falcon', 'ORG'), ('the fall of 2023', 'DATE'), ('NASA', 'ORG'), ('Commercial Lunar Payload Services Program', 'FAC'), ('Moon', 'PERSON'), ('NASA', 'ORG'), ('$93.3 million', 'MONEY'), ('10', 'CARDINAL'), ('the Mare Crisium', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('September', 'DATE'), ('9', 'CARDINAL')]"

I don’t recall the last time I saw so many colleagues legitimately excited for one specific new feature. MagSafe is back. Not the iPhone version (not to say that isn’t without its own charm) — the original. The laptop version. The version that Apple unceremoniously abandoned in 2017, with the arrival of the all-USB-C/Thunderbolt MacBook. This is, I fully recognize, a strange place to begin a lengthy review of a new Pro-focused laptop. MagSafe is hardly the most important arrival on the 2021 MacBook Pro. That distinction almost certainly belongs to the new M1 Pro and Max chips. But the proprietary connector is an important microcosm. It’s a crowd-pleaser for longtime devotees who have stuck with the line through port feast and port famine. The new model isn’t a kitchen-sink laptop — Apple doesn’t really do kitchen-sink devices. But, in addition to the new features, it finds the company returning some old favorites that many in the community no doubt feared were long gone. As the MacBook has evolved, features have come and gone. “Courage,” as the company infamously phrased it, when it dropped the headphone jack, back in 2016. That’s one of many instances where Apple was clearly ahead of the curve. But that’s the thing about courage. It doesn’t always wind up the way you’d expect. Image Credits: Brian Heater We as the consumers both demand change while complaining about it. We’re tough to please. Sometimes, as in the case of the headphone jack and the disk drive before it, mainstream consumer use catches up, and for many, the features are hardly missed. Other times, the manufacturer was hasty. The move from USB-A to USB-C was clearly a sign of inevitable progress. But losing MagSafe hurt. The connector is, happily, back — in improved form. It’s joined by an SD card slot (support for SD 4.0 standard, UHS-I and UHS-II SDXC cards), HDMI port and a row of function keys (replacing the beleaguered Touch Bar), which are all but gone from the current Mac lineup (with last year’s 13-inch MacBook Pro serving as the final holdout).There are three USB-C ports on-board — down from four on 13-inch. One never wants to lose any ports, but many will no doubt view the return of HDMI and MagSafe as a fair tradeoff. Your mileage may vary. Apple has made a concerted effort to recapture the creative pros who, for years, have been fundamental to its computer lineup. And in many ways, the new Pro models represent the purest manifestation of that. They’re powerful, hulking machines that look to the future of the Mac, while bringing back some hits from the past. With a year of hindsight, it seems entirely plausible that last year’s 13-inch MacBook Pro will go down as a kind of curiosity, like the 2016 MacBook before it. The device is sticking around in the lineup for the time being, as a 13-inch sibling to the newly announced 14- and 16-inch models. It’s a strange fit. The truth of it is that the 13-inch MacBook has more common DNA with the Air it was introduced alongside — a MacBook Pro Lite or MacBook Air+, perhaps. It was clear then that the distinction wasn’t as pronounced as we’ve come to expect between the two models, and the arrival of this year’s Pro models have only served to highlight the gulf. The heart of the product is, of course, Apple’s latest silicon. We expected a new chip in the lead up to this month’s Unleashed event, but Apple managed to surprise us by dropping two, the M1 Pro and M1 Max. Both are effectively souped-up versions of the M1 (built on the same 5nm architecture), and for most users in most scenarios, the differences between the two variants will be negligible. Heck, for most users in most scenarios, the regular old M1 will get the job done. But the core demo that Apple is going after here isn’t most users. It’s the creator class, the people who regularly push their systems to the limit with 3D rendering, 8K video editing and other activities that might have seemed a near impossibility on a laptop a decade back. Image Credits: Apple Quickly: M1: 16 billion transistors, 8 CPU cores, 7/8 GPU cores, 68.25 GBps memory bandwidth, 16GB max memory M1 Pro: 33.7 billion transistors, 8/10CPU cores, 14/16 GPU cores, 200 GBps memory bandwidth, 32GB max memory M1 Max: 57 billion transistors, 10CPU cores, 24/32 GPU cores, 400 GBps memory bandwidth, 64GB max memory After Apple unveiled the Pro and Max, the immediate question was how the company would divvy up the two chips. Ultimately, I think the company did the right thing here, offering the Max as an upgrade for both systems, at $200. These things add up fast, of course, but welcome to the Apple.com shopping cart. The company sent along the M1 Max with a 10-core PU and 32-core GPU, 64GB of RAM and 2TB of storage. Memory options range from 16 to 64GB (the latter of which can only be had with the Max) and 512GB all the way up to 8TB. This system is $4,100 as configured. Bump it up to 8TB of storage and you get all the way up to $5,899 (if you go for the 16-inch, meanwhile, you can move the needle over $6,000). That’s a $3,900 premium over the $1,999 entry price. The benchmark gains bear out the leap in specs. GeekBench’s single-core test for Apple Silicon didn’t see a massive gain, from 1711 on the 2020 MacBook Pro to 1781, but the multi-core score saw an impressive jump from 7549 to 12674. The GFXBench Metal graphics test, meanwhile, shows off the new GPU, jumping from 3490 frames (at 54.3 fps) to 7717.5 in the Aztec demo, and from 4981 frames (77.4 fps) to 17981 (279.6 fps) in the offscreen version. The system still lags some Nvidia GPUs in the former, but impressively outperforms others in the latter. What may be most remarkable among these numbers is the fact that Apple is capable of seeing big performance numbers with significantly less power consumption than much of the competition. Image Credits: Brian Heater The notion that the system doesn’t get hot is overstated — the bottom of the aluminum case gets toasty, but what is true is that you’re going to have to really push this system to get those fans to kick in. The battery life is beefy on this thing well. I was able to squeeze out 17:29 hours of Apple TV+ playback on a charge (the new Velvet Underground documentary is good. I know because I watched it A LOT). The reintroduction of MagSafe, meanwhile, brings fast charging, getting the system from zero to 50% battery in half an hour (with the 96 or 140W power adapter). The system can still be charged via one of the three USB-C ports (great for those times when you inevitably leave the proprietary plug at home), albeit not as quickly, topping out at 100W. The MagSafe plug comes with a nice new braided cable, but otherwise looks and functions remarkably similarly to the quick detaching plug we all know and mostly love. The MacBook also gets a design change to match its new internals. The 16-inch, for instance is thicker and heavier than its predecessor, bumping from 4.3 to 4.7 pounds and increasing from 0.64 to 0.66 inches thick. The 14-inch, meanwhile, weighs 3.5 pounds compared to the 13-inch’s three, while maintaining the same thickness as its smaller sibling. As someone who’s been carrying around the 2020 Air (on those occasions I actually leave my apartment), that’s not an insignificant difference. While my wild speculation questions the future of the 13-inch MacBook (at least in its current form), it’s hard to imagine the thinner, lighter Air going anywhere. Image Credits: Brian Heater The 14.2-inch display is big and bright, at 3024 x 1964. That comes in at 254 ppi to the 13-inch’s 227. Last year’s 500 nit brightness has increased to 1,000 nits sustained and up 1,600 peak brightness. That comes courtesy of a mini-LED array, with a 120Hz refresh rate (which adapts to suit the task, courtesy of ProMotion technology). The underlying tech is similar to what we saw on the most recent iPad Pro — and to date, a handful of laptops. Left: MacBook Air 2020, Right: MacBook Pro 2021 Thankfully, in this era of remote work, the FaceTime camera gets an upgrade, following in the footsteps of this year’s new iMac with a 1080p camera. That’s a nice upgrade from the 720p models we got on last year’s Pro and Air, which largely relied on computational photography and improvements from the M1 to improve things like white balance and reduce image noise. As you can see above, it’s a pretty dramatic improvement over the camera on the most recent Air. Image Credits: Brian Heater The bezels have been decreased by 24% over previous models. It’s not quite an edge-to-edge display, but it’s getting there. Along with that change came, perhaps, the most controversial addition, the dreaded notch. For a spirited assessment of the notch, read Devin’s piece. I’m mostly notch-agnostic, which is to say, obviously full screen would be best, but I also understand why they’re a thing. It’s something Apple has maintained on the iPhone since the introduction of the iPhone X four years ago. As the company noted at the event the other week, “it’s a really smart way to give you more space for your content, and when you’re in full-screen mode, you have that 16:10 window, and it looks great. It’s seamless.” I will say for certain that’s going to take some getting used to. Other mobile companies have moved toward pinholes and, even in some cases, under-screen cameras. The latter has largely been a mess, dramatically impacting image quality. Something you definitely don’t want on your webcam in the era of the Zoom call. Effectively the inclusion of the notch means additional screen real estate up top where the bezel would otherwise be. Most of the time, it’s nothing a good, dark background can’t mask, or in the case of full-screen video, letter box bars. It can, however, be a nuisance in full-screen mode, particularly in the case of apps with intensive menu systems. The menu bar automatically wraps around the notch. Developers don’t need to anything, it simply moves the menu bar items down so as not to be obscured. This was the case with Audacity, which has yet to even release an Apple silicon version, let alone develop for that brand new notch. The pointer, meanwhile, effectively passes under the notch when you scroll past. If you need more than just a 14-inch display (don’t we all, sometimes?), the Pro chip is capable of supporting two Pro Display XDRs. With the Max, you can run Pro Display XDRs and a 4K TV. The reintroduced HDMI port supports 4K60 and HDR video. Image Credits: Brian Heater The keyboard has been something of a sore spot for the MacBook line over the last several years. Thankfully, the company eventually returned to a mechanism that worked last year, after horror stories of stuck keys and an eventual keyboard replacement program. The current configuration tends toward the softer side of the laptop keyboard spectrum, but it’s light years beyond the rocky missteps of a few years back. Whether the Touch Bar qualifies as a “rocky misstep” itself is a question of perspective, but it seems pretty clear that it fell short of Apple’s expectations. Having a super thin touch display over the keys is an interesting idea in theory, but I don’t know many people who regularly interacted with it. It was one of those things you wanted to like, but ultimately never offered up enough reasons to justify its continued existence. Which is to say that I, for one, am not sad to see it go. Image Credits: Brian Heater It’s too early to mourn its death completely, as it continues to hang on to the 13-inch MacBook for dear life, but, well, the future doesn’t look particularly bright for that input device. In its place, the full-height function keys are back, and leave it to Apple to position their return as a great new feature. As the company writes: For the first time, Magic Keyboard brings a full‑height function key row to MacBook Pro — with the tactile feel of mechanical keys that pros love. The keys include brightness, dictation, volume, Spotlight, Siri, Do Not Disrupt and music play back. It also maintains what was always the best part of the Touch Bar: Touch ID. This time it’s a full-size key, rather than the nub that you get on last year’s Air. Image Credits: Brian Heater Much like the return of MagSafe, the abandonment of the Touch Bar is a prime example of why the new MacBooks are the best in years. They build on the technologies and learnings of previous generations introduce some key breakthroughs and, perhaps, most importantly, listened to user feedback. That means moving on from what doesn’t work and doubling down on what does, and above all, not ever assuming you know what’s best for the consumer — particularly in the case of extremely particular creative pros. Priced between $1,999 and $5,899, this is very much not the MacBook for everyone. For most consumers, the MacBook Air gets the job done — and then some. But if you’re someone who regularly finds yourself pushing your machine to the limits, the new Pro is a great marriage of the line’s best elements.",2021-10-25 13:00:39,"The reaction among TechCrunch staff was swift and, best I can tell, universal.

It’s a crowd-pleaser for longtime devotees who have stuck with the line through port feast and port famine. The new model isn’t a kitchen-sink laptop — Apple doesn’t really do kitchen-sink devices. But, in addition to the new features, it finds the company returning some old favorites that many in the community no doubt feared were long gone. As the MacBook has evolved, features have come and gone. “Courage,” as the company infamously phrased it, when it dropped the headphone jack, back in 2016. That’s one of many instances where Apple was clearly ahead of the curve. But that’s the thing about courage. It doesn’t always wind up the way you’d expect. Image Credits: Brian Heater We as the consumers both demand change while complaining about it. We’re tough to please. Sometimes, as in the case of the headphone jack and the disk drive before it, mainstream consumer use catches up, and for many, the features are hardly missed. Other times, the manufacturer was hasty. The move from USB-A to USB-C was clearly a sign of inevitable progress. But losing MagSafe hurt. The connector is, happily, back — in improved form. It’s joined by an SD card slot (support for SD 4.0 standard, UHS-I and UHS-II SDXC cards) , HDMI port and a row of function keys (replacing the beleaguered Touch Bar), which are all but gone from the current Mac lineup (with last year’s 13-inch MacBook Pro serving as the final holdout).There are three USB-C ports on-board — down from four on 13-inch. One never wants to lose any ports, but many will no doubt view the return of HDMI and MagSafe as a fair tradeoff. Your mileage may vary. Apple has made a concerted effort to recapture the creative pros who, for years, have been fundamental to its computer lineup. And in many ways, the new Pro models represent the purest manifestation of that. They’re powerful, hulking machines that look to the future of the Mac, while bringing back some hits from the past. With a year of hindsight, it seems entirely plausible that last year’s 13-inch MacBook Pro will go down as a kind of curiosity, like the 2016 MacBook before it. The device is sticking around in the lineup for the time being, as a 13-inch sibling to the newly announced 14- and 16-inch models. It’s a strange fit. The truth of it is that the 13-inch MacBook has more common DNA with the Air it was introduced alongside — a MacBook Pro Lite or MacBook Air+, perhaps. It was clear then that the distinction wasn’t as pronounced as we’ve come to expect between the two models, and the arrival of this year’s Pro models have only served to highlight the gulf. The heart of the product is, of course, Apple’s latest silicon. We expected a new chip in the lead up to this month’s Unleashed event, but Apple managed to surprise us by dropping two, the M1 Pro and M1 Max. Both are effectively souped-up versions of the M1 (built on the same 5nm architecture), and for most users in most scenarios, the differences between the two variants will be negligible. Heck, for most users in most scenarios, the regular old M1 will get the job done. But the core demo that Apple is going after here isn’t most users. It’s the creator class, the people who regularly push their systems to the limit with 3D rendering, 8K video editing and other activities that might have seemed a near impossibility on a laptop a decade back. Image Credits: Apple Quickly: After Apple unveiled the Pro and Max, the immediate question was how the company would divvy up the two chips. Ultimately, I think the company did the right thing here, offering the Max as an upgrade for both systems, at $200. These things add up fast, of course, but welcome to the Apple.com shopping cart. The company sent along the M1 Max with a 10-core PU and 32-core GPU, 64GB of RAM and 2TB of storage. Memory options range from 16 to 64GB (the latter of which can only be had with the Max) and 512GB all the way up to 8TB. This system is $4,100 as configured. Bump it up to 8TB of storage and you get all the way up to $5,899 (if you go for the 16-inch, meanwhile, you can move the needle over $6,000). That’s a $3,900 premium over the $1,999 entry price. The benchmark gains bear out the leap in specs. GeekBench’s single-core test for Apple Silicon didn’t see a massive gain, from 1711 on the 2020 MacBook Pro to 1781, but the multi-core score saw an impressive jump from 7549 to 12674. The GFXBench Metal graphics test, meanwhile, shows off the new GPU, jumping from 3490 frames (at 54.3 fps) to 7717.5 in the Aztec demo, and from 4981 frames (77.4 fps) to 17981 (279.6 fps) in the offscreen version. The system still lags some Nvidia GPUs in the former, but impressively outperforms others in the latter. What may be most remarkable among these numbers is the fact that Apple is capable of seeing big performance numbers with significantly less power consumption than much of the competition. Image Credits: Brian Heater The notion that the system doesn’t get hot is overstated — the bottom of the aluminum case gets toasty, but what is true is that you’re going to have to really push this system to get those fans to kick in. The battery life is beefy on this thing well. I was able to squeeze out 17:29 hours of Apple TV+ playback on a charge (the new Velvet Underground documentary is good. I know because I watched it A LOT). The reintroduction of MagSafe, meanwhile, brings fast charging, getting the system from zero to 50% battery in half an hour (with the 96 or 140W power adapter). The system can still be charged via one of the three USB-C ports (great for those times when you inevitably leave the proprietary plug at home), albeit not as quickly, topping out at 100W. The MagSafe plug comes with a nice new braided cable, but otherwise looks and functions remarkably similarly to the quick detaching plug we all know and mostly love. The MacBook also gets a design change to match its new internals. The 16-inch, for instance is thicker and heavier than its predecessor, bumping from 4.3 to 4.7 pounds and increasing from 0.64 to 0.66 inches thick. The 14-inch, meanwhile, weighs 3.5 pounds compared to the 13-inch’s three, while maintaining the same thickness as its smaller sibling. As someone who’s been carrying around the 2020 Air (on those occasions I actually leave my apartment), that’s not an insignificant difference. While my wild speculation questions the future of the 13-inch MacBook (at least in its current form), it’s hard to imagine the thinner, lighter Air going anywhere. Image Credits: Brian Heater The 14.2-inch display is big and bright, at 3024 x 1964. That comes in at 254 ppi to the 13-inch’s 227. Last year’s 500 nit brightness has increased to 1,000 nits sustained and up 1,600 peak brightness. That comes courtesy of a mini-LED array, with a 120Hz refresh rate (which adapts to suit the task, courtesy of ProMotion technology). The underlying tech is similar to what we saw on the most recent iPad Pro — and to date, a handful of laptops. Left: MacBook Air 2020, Right: MacBook Pro 2021 Thankfully, in this era of remote work, the FaceTime camera gets an upgrade, following in the footsteps of this year’s new iMac with a 1080p camera. That’s a nice upgrade from the 720p models we got on last year’s Pro and Air, which largely relied on computational photography and improvements from the M1 to improve things like white balance and reduce image noise. As you can see above, it’s a pretty dramatic improvement over the camera on the most recent Air. Image Credits: Brian Heater The bezels have been decreased by 24% over previous models. It’s not quite an edge-to-edge display, but it’s getting there. Along with that change came, perhaps, the most controversial addition, the dreaded notch. For a spirited assessment of the notch, read Devin’s piece . I’m mostly notch-agnostic, which is to say, obviously full screen would be best, but I also understand why they’re a thing. It’s something Apple has maintained on the iPhone since the introduction of the iPhone X four years ago. As the company noted at the event the other week, “it’s a really smart way to give you more space for your content, and when you’re in full-screen mode, you have that 16:10 window, and it looks great. It’s seamless.” I will say for certain that’s going to take some getting used to. Other mobile companies have moved toward pinholes and, even in some cases, under-screen cameras. The latter has largely been a mess, dramatically impacting image quality. Something you definitely don’t want on your webcam in the era of the Zoom call. Effectively the inclusion of the notch means additional screen real estate up top where the bezel would otherwise be. Most of the time, it’s nothing a good, dark background can’t mask, or in the case of full-screen video, letter box bars. It can, however, be a nuisance in full-screen mode, particularly in the case of apps with intensive menu systems. The menu bar automatically wraps around the notch. Developers don’t need to anything, it simply moves the menu bar items down so as not to be obscured. This was the case with Audacity, which has yet to even release an Apple silicon version, let alone develop for that brand new notch. The pointer, meanwhile, effectively passes under the notch when you scroll past. If you need more than just a 14-inch display (don’t we all, sometimes?), the Pro chip is capable of supporting two Pro Display XDRs. With the Max, you can run Pro Display XDRs and a 4K TV. The reintroduced HDMI port supports 4K60 and HDR video. Image Credits: Brian Heater The keyboard has been something of a sore spot for the MacBook line over the last several years. Thankfully, the company eventually returned to a mechanism that worked last year, after horror stories of stuck keys and an eventual keyboard replacement program. The current configuration tends toward the softer side of the laptop keyboard spectrum, but it’s light years beyond the rocky missteps of a few years back. Whether the Touch Bar qualifies as a “rocky misstep” itself is a question of perspective, but it seems pretty clear that it fell short of Apple’s expectations. Having a super thin touch display over the keys is an interesting idea in theory, but I don’t know many people who regularly interacted with it. It was one of those things you wanted to like, but ultimately never offered up enough reasons to justify its continued existence. Which is to say that I, for one, am not sad to see it go. Image Credits: Brian Heater It’s too early to mourn its death completely, as it continues to hang on to the 13-inch MacBook for dear life, but, well, the future doesn’t look particularly bright for that input device. In its place, the full-height function keys are back, and leave it to Apple to position their return as a great new feature. As the company writes: For the first time, Magic Keyboard brings a full‑height function key row to MacBook Pro — with the tactile feel of mechanical keys that pros love. The keys include brightness, dictation, volume, Spotlight, Siri, Do Not Disrupt and music play back. It also maintains what was always the best part of the Touch Bar: Touch ID. This time it’s a full-size key, rather than the nub that you get on last year’s Air. Image Credits: Brian Heater Much like the return of MagSafe, the abandonment of the Touch Bar is a prime example of why the new MacBooks are the best in years. They build on the technologies and learnings of previous generations introduce some key breakthroughs and, perhaps, most importantly, listened to user feedback. That means moving on from what doesn’t work and doubling down on what does, and above all, not ever assuming you know what’s best for the consumer — particularly in the case of extremely particular creative pros. Priced between $1,999 and $5,899, this is very much not the MacBook for everyone. For most consumers, the MacBook Air gets the job done — and then some. But if you’re someone who regularly finds yourself pushing your machine to the limits, the new Pro is a great marriage of the line’s best elements.",,techcrunch,True,"[('TechCrunch', 'ORG'),

Russian hackers targeting US networks in ‘very large and ongoing’ cyberattack,https://nypost.com/2021/10/25/russian-hackers-target-us-networks-in-ongoing-cyberattack/,,['Emily Crane'],,Russian-linked hackers blamed for the massive cyberattack on the US last year have been targeting hundreds of companies and organizations in its latest wave of attacks on US-based computer networks.,Russian-linked hackers blamed for the massive cyberattack on the US last year have been targeting hundreds of companies and organizations in its latest wave of attacks on US-based computer networks.,2021-10-25 12:57:44,"Russian-linked hackers blamed for the massive cyberattack on the US last year have been targeting hundreds of companies and organizations in its latest wave of attacks on US-based computer networks — as the White House dismisses the incident as “unsophisticated, run-of-the mill operations.” In a blog post Sunday , Microsoft said Nobelium – the Russian-based agency behind last years’ widespread SolarWinds attack – has been targeting cloud service providers and technology service organizations in a bid to obtain data. The attacks have targeted organizations in the US and Europe since May, Microsoft said. One of Microsoft’s top security officers Tom Burt told the New York Times , which first reported the breach, that the latest attack was “very large and ongoing.” “Nobelium has been attempting to replicate the approach it has used in past attacks by targeting organizations integral to the global IT supply chain. This time, it is attacking a different part of the supply chain: resellers and other technology service providers that customize, deploy and manage cloud services and other technologies on behalf of their customers,” Microsoft said in its blog post. “We believe Nobelium ultimately hopes to piggyback on any direct access that resellers may have to their customers’ IT systems and more easily impersonate an organization’s trusted technology partner to gain access to their downstream customers.” Microsoft said it had notified 609 customers between July 1 and Oct. 19 they had been attacked. The company insisted only a small percent of the latest attempts were successful. “This recent activity is another indicator that Russia is trying to gain long-term, systematic access to a variety of points in the technology supply chain and establish a mechanism for surveilling – now or in the future – targets of interest to the Russian government,” Microsoft said. “The attacks we’ve observed in the recent campaign against resellers and service providers have not attempted to exploit any flaw or vulnerability in software but rather used well-known techniques, like password spray and phishing, to steal legitimate credentials and gain privileged access.” Microsoft said it had learned enough about these new attacks to provide information that “can be used to defend against this new approach.” A Biden administration official told the Times the latest attacks were “unsophisticated, run-of-the mill operations that could have been prevented if the cloud service providers had implemented baseline cybersecurity practices.” “We can do a lot of things… but the responsibility to implement simple cybersecurity practices to lock their — and by extension, our — digital doors rests with the private sector,” the official said.

Just on a straight added-capital basis that would put its valuation at close to $5 billion but the company also notes that it has been seeing accelerated growth — the number of brands under its wing has doubled since then to 200 — so very likely some ways higher than that. Current brands include Angry Orange pet deodorizers and stain removers, SafeRest mattress protectors and ThisWorx car cleaning and detailing products. The company, founded in 2018, has now raised $3.4 billion, including a $650 million debt round earlier this year. Thrasio is one of the pioneers of the modern “roll up” player, and its traction, along with the wider opportunity in the market, have spawned dozens of other startups around the world building businesses replicating its model that have collectively raised hundreds of millions of dollars in equity and debt to build out their businesses. Other recent fundings in the space have included Heroes, which raised $200 million in August; Olsam ($165 million); Suma Brands ($150 million); Elevate Brands ($250 million); Perch ($775 million); factory14 ($200 million); as well as Heyday, The Razor Group, Branded, SellerX, Berlin Brands Group (X2), Benitago, Latin America’s Valoreo and Rainforest and Una Brands out of Asia. One of the reasons it has raised so much in this round is to better target that global opportunity. Thrasio already has operations in the UK, Germany China and Japan and the plan is to expand that further, both as a means of finding more companies to gobble up, but also to expand its wider supply chain. That wider opportunity, meanwhile, remains a large one despite how crowded the market is getting. By various estimates there are between 5 million and 10 million third-party merchants selling on Amazon alone, leveraging the e-commerce giant’s giant audience of shoppers and its Fulfillment by Amazon platform for delivery and other distribution logistics to cut down the operational costs and inefficiencies of building a direct-to-consumer business from the ground up. Thrasio’s co-CEO and co-founder Josh Silberstein told me earlier this year that Thrasio estimates that there are around 50,000 businesses out of those that make more than $1 million in revenues annually, so the tail of what is out there in terms of size is very long. Thrasio is building out a bigger economy of scale play around that basic model, and in some cases replacing some of the Amazon components with scale of its own, which — the theory goes — only improves as it grows. That includes sourcing for products (as well as wider supply chain challenges), analytics both to source the more interesting companies to buy up as well as to market those products once under the Thrasio wing, even its own fulfillment technology. It is also increasingly also looking at opportunities to build sales and customer relationships outside of the Amazon ecosystem, using other marketplaces, other sales channels and in some cases direct-to-consumer plays. (And that analytics engine for sourcing potential acquisitions is working hard: Thrasio says that it has “evaluated” some 6,000 businesses overall.) “Our business is getting better as it gets bigger, and these investments will be invaluable as we continue on that path,” said Carlos Cashman, the other co-founder and CEO of Thrasio, in a statement. “Advent and Silver Lake both have phenomenal track records of building successful global businesses, and the additional funds from existing investors including Upper90 and PEAK6 are extremely rewarding votes of confidence in a crowded space.” “Thrasio created the Amazon aggregator category, and their innovative approach and impressive growth have brought a lot of attention to this space,” said Greg Mondre, co-CEO, and Stephen Evans, managing director, of Silver Lake, in a joint statement. “We believe Carlos Cashman and his team are well positioned to accelerate their growth and build the preeminent next-generation, technology-driven consumer goods company. We’re excited to partner with Carlos, his team and the existing shareholders as the company enters the next phase of growth.” “Thrasio has quickly established itself as the largest ecommerce aggregator globally, and we are thrilled to strengthen our partnership with Carlos and his team, in addition to welcoming Silver Lake as a new investor,” added David Mussafer, chairman and managing partner and Jeff Case, managing director, of Advent International. “Thrasio is well positioned for further success, and we look forward to working with the company as it continues to scale.”",2021-10-25 12:43:21,"One of the big leaders in buying up and scaling third-party merchants selling on Amazon and other marketplace platforms is announcing a major round of funding today as it continues to expand its ambitions.

Musk v Bezos: real rivals or fake feud? Our research gives a clue,https://theconversation.com/musk-v-bezos-real-rivals-or-fake-feud-our-research-gives-a-clue-170314,,"['Ben Little', ' Lecturer in Media and Cultural Politics', ' University of East Anglia']",,,"Flick through a news feed on your phone and you are likely to scroll across an article discussing the heated rivalries of the new space race. Forget the geopolitical struggles of a cold war. This time, it’s Tesla CEO Elon Musk versus Amazon founder Jeff Bezos: the two richest men in the world duking it out over whether SpaceX or Blue Origin, their respective companies, will be the dominant force in the new industry of private space flight. Occasionally, Richard Branson of Virgin Galactic gets a mention too, but the Brit being a relative pauper, and his space plane lacking the phallic majesty of his fellow billionaires’ rockets, he has received diminishing attention in recent weeks. The Musk v Bezos rivalry makes for good press and is stoked occasionally in tweets by both parties, but is it real? Probably not, according to our research, published in the book The New Patriarchs of Digital Patriarchy: Celebrity Tech Founders and Networks of Power, which analyses 95 popular books about the technology industry. It is easy to see that, at a basic level, Musk’s and Bezos’s stated plans for space domination are complementary, rather than competitive. Bezos dismisses Musk’s plan to colonise Mars as unrealistic, while Musk thinks it will take too long to build the infrastructure for the giant orbiting space stations that Bezos proposes. Read between the lines and you can see how they had been rhetorically dividing up the space industry into separate monopolies even before their rockets broke the “Karman line” – one definition of where outer space begins. The reality is that, as with other technology billionaires, such as Alphabet’s Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg or even Palantir’s Peter Thiel, their interests align more often than they diverge. This new space race is partly a celebrity publicity stunt to generate clickbait headlines that build public awareness of, and popular support for, a new commercial frontier. If we focus on the rivalry and keep asking who’s winning, perhaps we won’t ask the big whys of commercial space colonisation. Is Bezos looking for a new monopoly in space? MICHAEL REYNOLDS/EPA In general, there is little in the tech barons’ interest to actually work against one another. Writing in his 2014 book Zero to One, Thiel has claimed that “competition is a relic of history”, and because a competitive market is seen as fundamental to capitalism, “monopolists lie to protect themselves”. These billionaires, all monopolists, may indeed use their celebrity profiles to create the illusion of competition where there is none. Google co-founder Larry Page also stated in a speech that Silicon Valley’s billionaires “travel as if they are pack dogs and stick to each other like glue”. We learned through our research that the West Coast billionaires that dominate the tech industry do indeed support each other financially and strategically. We carried out a digital search of a 10 million word database, containing the books we investigated, which is known as a broad context collocation. The algorithm searched for instances in which the entrepreneurs were listed together, and sorted it by context – such as collaboration, rivalry, friendship, political lobbying and philanthropy. This helped us identity a dense network, which you can see in the diagram. Silicon Valley networks. Ben Little, Author provided So while Bezos and Musk haven’t directly financially supported each other, they are part of a wider system that has. Bezos was an early funder of Google, and in turn Google’s founders put money into Musk’s ventures from as early as 2006. As Ashlee Vance writes in his biography of Musk, Google underwrote Tesla to the tune of $5 billion (£3.6 billion) in 2013 when it looked as if it was about to go under, as well as investing large sums in SpaceX at critical moments. Race to the bottom? There are plenty of good reasons to be exploring space, but we just don’t know if these billionaires will prioritise profit or science, benefits to humanity or a much narrower substratum of the wealthy. The signs don’t look good, as Musk launches thousands of Starlink satellites that risk turning low earth orbit into a junk yard. Meanwhile, the ten minutes of weightlessness offered by Bezos are a luxury affordable only to the 0.01% – not to mention being damaging for our planet. As a group, Silicon Valley entrepreneurs present a shared belief in using technological solutions to social problems. Social media platforms are designed to better connect us by fostering divisions, and spaceships offer a way to escape a planet that may no longer be able to comfortably support us. These solutions and the problems they purport to solve have been presented to us, since the days of Steve Jobs, the late chairman of Apple, as the result of the vision of the “genius founder” – an awkward, but dazzling leader: a mythic figure who expands the frontiers of human endeavour. It started with home computers, then went online and now it is soaring into space. Instead of dividends (another relic, like competition), these businesses are valued in headlines, tweets and “vision”. Tesla is the most valuable car company in the world based almost entirely on Musk’s celebrity inspiring a legion of fans to invest in the company. Amazon is a ruthless monopoly that secured its early market lead after aggressive tax avoidance and punishing hours for its staff. But because Bezos is framed as an inspirational CEO, a culture of overwork has been transformed into the can-do spirit of the American frontier. These entrepreneurs tell us compelling stories about their lives, their businesses and their vision. We will never know if they are true, manicured and coiffured as they are through one of the most successful publicity machines in history. So if we find ourselves swimming in clickbait about these men, it’s not incidental that we find them alongside celebrity news: it’s absolutely fundamental to their business strategies and thus a key source of their wealth and power.

A new way to organize cancer mutations could lead to better treatment matches for patients,https://theconversation.com/a-new-way-to-organize-cancer-mutations-could-lead-to-better-treatment-matches-for-patients-168348,,"['Jacqulyne Robichaux', ' Assistant Professor of Thoracic & Head and Neck Oncology', ' The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center']",,,"Lung cancer is the No. 1 cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. vladwel/iStock via Getty Images PlusThere are many types of cancer treatments. But which ones work best varies from patient to patient. Currently, doctors determine which treatment to try for a patient based on where in their DNA, or genetic code, the error that caused the cancer is located. But a new approach that groups patients by the changes in protein structure and function caused by that error, rather than by the location of the changes in DNA, could lead to both more inclusive clinical trials and better treatment matches for patients. I am part of a team that researches targeted therapies for cancer and ways to make treatment more patient-specific. A recent study by our research team determined that grouping DNA errors by structure may better personalize cancer therapies. Targeted therapies hone in on cancer cells Mutations are errors made during cell replication when the genetic material of that cell, or DNA, makes a new copy of itself. These mutations are usually harmless and caught by the cell’s proofreading machinery. However, the proofreader occasionally fails. And on rare instances, these mutations occur in parts of the DNA called oncogenes. Under normal conditions, oncogenes are essential to normal growth and development, such as fetal organ development and general tissue repair and maintenance. But when mutations cause oncogenes to signal for unregulated growth, cancer can form. Cancer results from mutations that direct a cell to undergo unfettered growth. One way to kill these tumor cells is to use targeted therapy. Cancer-targeted therapies bind specifically to the defective proteins produced by mutated oncogenes and prevent them from sending a “grow” signal. Because targeted therapies bind directly to the cancerous protein, they spare most noncancerous cells from being harmed. This results in more specific cancer cell killing and less overall treatment toxicity. In contrast, chemotherapy attacks all actively dividing cells, which includes not just cancer but also hair follicles, the digestive tract and other parts of the body. To make targeted therapies more specific, scientists often study the physical or structural changes that mutations cause in proteins. They design drugs that preferentially bind to these particular changes to prevent the defective protein from causing uncontrolled growth. However, because mutations can occur in many different areas of a protein, multiple targeted therapies are often necessary to bind all the different mutations that occur across cancer types. This leads to a difficult clinical problem: How do physicians match patients to the most effective targeted therapy for their mutations? Traditional treatments use mutation location To attempt to answer this question, our research team chose to focus on one oncogene in lung cancer, EGFR, or epidermal growth factor receptor. We did this for two reasons. First, lung cancer remains the No. 1 cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Second, EGFR mutations are among the most common forms of lung cancer – they occur in approximately a third of non-small-cell lung cancers worldwide, amounting to over 550,000 patients annually. Mutations in EGFR, one of the most commonly mutated oncogenes in lung cancer, change the shape of the protein, which directly affects how it functions. F. Gervasio/UCL Chemistry and ISMB, CC BY EGFR has many different mutations that cause unregulated growth. Multiple generations of targeted therapies are available for this population of patients. Clinical trials and treatment options for patients with oncogene-driven lung cancer, particularly with EGFR, are currently based on the type and location of the mutation in the DNA. However, mutation location is not the best approach to predict how well patients will respond to a drug. Because mutations change the shape of a protein, they can alter the way targeted therapies interact with the protein. Regrouping cancer mutations By examining the mutated structures of different EGFR proteins, our team found that they could be categorized into distinct subgroups. For example, we found that mutations that form away from the areas of the protein that drugs target don’t noticeably affect how well the drug binds to the protein. Cells with this kind of protein mutation were thus killed by all types of EGFR inhibitors. Although these mutations occurred across many locations in the DNA, they shared the same overall structural and functional effect on proteins. Conversely, mutations that form near typical drug target areas compress this region and prevent certain EGFR inhibitors from attaching to the protein. These mutations also occurred in several different DNA locations. Targeted therapies hone in on cancerous cells to spare healthy cells from damage. rightdx/iStrock via Getty Images Plus Based on these findings, our team hypothesized that structural changes in similar protein regions, not DNA location, would cause similar changes in how well a drug works. To test our hypothesis, we retrospectively analyzed public and hospital data on how well patients responded to cancer treatments. We sorted patients into traditional DNA location-based groups and our newly defined structure/function-based subgroups to determine whether one group had more patients who responded better than the other to different drugs. We found that the structure/function-based subgroups identified nearly twice as many patients that benefited from a particular drug compared with the DNA location-based groups. Grouping patients by structure/function also identified which EGFR inhibitor provided the longest clinical benefit for patients. More inclusive clinical trials In addition to potentially matching patients to more effective treatments, clinical trials using structure-based subgroups may lead to broader access to therapies. Current clinical trials exclude up to a fifth of patients with EGFR mutant non-small-cell lung cancer because each clinical trial typically focuses on only a handful of specific mutation types. Reframing clinical studies to be based on the changes that mutations cause to protein structure and function, as opposed to their location on DNA, could expand treatment options to include patients with more rare EGFR mutant cancers. This approach provides a framework that clinical trials could use to make studies more inclusive of all types of mutations. And it may also identify previously ignored or hidden mutation subgroups that can lead to additional drug development and ultimately improve patient care.

Like them or not, they’re a convenient way to keep from convening at the office. While the commute might be improved, the increased amount of distractions we experience at home can severely diminish the quality of our interactions. The unwanted sounds picked up by the sensitive microphone in your computer can interfere with hearing crucial information during important calls. Changing your setup or improving your hardware can certainly help reduce some interference. But if you really want to reduce all background noise, your best bet is to use a software application like Krisp. You’ll get better results without having to use filters or upgrading to a better microphone. Krisp also works with all microphones and headphones, harnessing the power of AI to recognize and remove unwanted sounds. Powered by Deep Neural Networks Krisp’s AI-based noise reduction technology will cut out any background noise from your meetings, video chats, online courses and conference calls — leaving only the human voice discernible. The background noise from other participants can also be removed during calls, so you’ll no longer need to ask anyone to “mute themselves,” which always sounds a bit rude. Krisp technology is based on deep neural networks and is trained using thousands of hours of audio. Its bi-directional noise removal takes away noise from both the microphone and the speaker. Additionally, Krisp removes the acoustic echo that can occur from your own voice, as well as removing room echo, which can resonate from walls of empty rooms during calls. Adding this protective layer to your microphone, Krisp delivers clean-sounding audio and HD voice quality. Sounding like you’re speaking from a submarine below sea level will be a thing of the past, as will be any distortion. Say Goodbye to Distractions Whether you’re an entrepreneur, salesperson, or consultant, this one simple application can help limit your distractions and keep them from hijacking your focus during important calls. For some uncanny reason, the gardeners next door seem to have impeccable timing for starting their work during video chats or, worse, an already stressful interview. If you don’t have this issue, then maybe it’s a baby crying, a dog barking, the roof being replaced, or traffic outside your window. Perhaps woodworking is your neighbor’s hobby? Inside the house, we contend with the vacuum cleaner, washing machine, and dishwasher, along with the fan and air-conditioner on a hot day. Even someone clicking away at their keyboard can be bothersome when trying to concentrate. Limiting all these distractions, and more, for both you and your clients will help you conduct more productive meetings and focus on what’s really important. Seamless Integration Krisp works with any wired or wireless microphone, speaker, headset, and headphones. It seamlessly integrates with any communication and recording app that includes audio and microphone settings, like Microsoft Teams, Slack, Zoom, and around 800 others. With Krisp, it’s easy to record the audio of your meetings at any time and share them with your colleagues. You’ll find other software on the market with similar functions that edit out ambient noises from recordings, like Audacity, GarageBand, Wavosaur, and Wavepad. Krisp, however, actually blocks ambient noises from entering the recording, providing studio-like audio quality in real-time during your meetings and calls. Recognized Industry-Favorite Krisp’s enhanced security features protect your data with maximum privacy. In fact, Krisp performs all audio processing locally, so your voice and audio will never leave your device. TIME listed Krisp as one of The Best Inventions of 2020. Krisp is also included on the Forbes AI 50 — a list of private, U.S.-based companies that are using artificial intelligence in meaningful business-oriented ways. We couldn’t agree more. In this era of working from home, Krisp’s unique software is a game-changer. Demo the software today to see what Forbes, Gartner, and Time are hailing as one of the best tech innovations in recent history.

Hello readers: Welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B. TechCrunch’s Rebecca Bellan and Aria Alamalhodaei were a bit ambitious this week, which means I dialed back some of the other parts. Let’s go! But before we dive in, I wanted to give a nod to the inaugural effort of the Indy Autonomous Challenge, which was held Saturday. The IAC brought together students from 21 universities from 9 countries, who were charged with programming driverless racecars to compete in a high-speed autonomous race. The winning team, which received the $1 million grand prize, was the Technical University of Munich. I did not attend, but was told by a few folks who were there that it was a small, yet fun event and solid foundation had been established for this to continue in future years. As always, you can email me at kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com to share thoughts, criticisms, opinions or tips. You also can send a direct message to me at Twitter — @kirstenkorosec. Micromobbin’ Let’s start the week with a new-ish company and this week’s unsung hero of micromobility: Zoba. Zoba, a Boston-based startup that runs fleet optimization for many major micromobility companies, including Spin, just announced a $12 million Series A raise. The company’s AI runs behind the operator’s fleet management software. Zoba’s software takes into account shifting local regulations and basically helps micromobility companies get as many customers on vehicles as possible, while being as efficient as possible and helping to adhere to a company’s bottom line. While we’re on the subject of bottom lines, Lime said CEO Wayne Ting said the third quarter of 2021 would be the company’s second profitable quarter, adjusted for EBITDA, of course. While Lime wasn’t able to generate more sales or revenue to increase top line growth, it seems it was able to increase efficiency in a way that quite possibly has led to profitability. But we’ll have to take their word for it. Nothing can be certain until the company goes public and dishes up those earnings. Bolt Mobility is launching both an in-app navigation system for its e-scooters, called “MobilityOS,” as well as a new scooter with a built-in smartphone holder that also uses the scooter’s battery to charge the phone! Let’s see how that one goes. Is it safer to just listen to audio directions and occasionally try to check your phone while riding, or is it safer to take a cheeky peek down at the screen every now and again? Helbiz has partnered with mapping company Fantasmo to integrate its parking tech into Helbiz’s e-scooter app. Fantasmo’s camera-positioning tech detects the exact location of e-scooters and validates parking within eight inches or less via a rider’s phone camera. The integration will roll out in Miami first. Voi is making a Copenhagen comeback as the city aims to become the world’s first carbon-neutral capital by 2025. Voi, based in neighboring country Sweden, is bringing 800 e-scooters to the Danish metropolis for the next year; the service could be extended another two years if all goes well. Niu Technologies, a Chinese electric motor scooter manufacturer, announced it would start making e-bikes in order to help grow its international presence. The e-bike series includes a 15 mph and a 28 mph version. The bikes are pretty heavy at nearly 100 pounds, due to large aluminum frames and oversized dual suspension. Japanese motorcycle manufacturer Kawasaki says it’s going all-electric in developed countries by 2035, which really gives it plenty of time to get its model together and keep selling gas-powered motorcycles in the meantime. To compete with Ola’s amazing success selling electric scooters (the big ones, not the kick ones), Honda announced it would be selling the same in India. Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India told the Economic Times it would have a product within the next financial year. Finally, at the Micromobility America conference last month, micromobility legend Horace Dediu presented the 10 commandments of micromobility, which I now present to you. I do think you should watch the video, as well. 1. Nobody invented micromobility. “Micromobility is the confluence of thousands of ideas and the work of thousands of people.” A range of enabling technologies, like lithium ion batteries becoming cheaper, led to this micro outcome. 2. Most trips are short, which means short trips are more important. 50% of trips are from 0 to 5 miles. That number could actually increase if people have more access to a vehicle that’s designed for shorter trips. 3. Cars are a bundle. You can substitute the short trips with smaller vehicles, and you can substitute the bigger trips with bigger vehicles that are shared, like planes, trains and buses. 4. The smaller it gets, the bigger it gets. And by this he means volumes. For example, Android and iPhone sales far surpass those of PCs and other revolutionary computers, even though they came to market much later. In terms of vehicles, Dediu expects micromobility vehicles to grow much faster than electric vehicles in the future. 5. You can’t get there from here. There are more cars than ever in all of our cities and countries, and based on adoption curves, that number will only increase exponentially. Even if you tried to electrify all cars, emissions would still rise beyond legal limits. But with micromobility, we could have twice the number of drivers with half the amount of emissions. 6. Don’t dig where there’s no treasure. All infrastructure is a sunk cost. All the arguments we have about not changing infrastructure are based on the massive costs associated with infrastructure builds, but those are fallacies. We’ve destroyed infrastructures in the past. Inner-city highways can be demolished, too. 7. They promised flying taxis. We got bike lanes. Hundreds of billions of dollars have been spent on big moonshots like autonomous vehicles and flying cars, but the simple bike lane is far better and more revolutionary than “any of this crap.” 8. You sell miles, but customers buy smiles. The transition to micromobility will happen because people are happy with the vehicles and like riding them. 9. Micromobility is a mind for the bicycle. Micromobility absorbs data, software, intelligence and sensing. It’s cheaper and builds on the shoulders of giants, and it’s increasingly the smartest machine on the road. “The power of software allows us to invest in solutions to overcome most of our machines’ shortcomings. 10. Cities always win. Micromobility is urban freedom. Cities have gone through much worse than coronavirus, and they all came back stronger than ever. Cities are antifragile, the more you stress them, the stronger they become. — Rebecca Bellan Deal of the week Welp … I’m not ready to call peak urban air mobility quite yet, but we might be getting close. HT Aero, an urban air mobility company that’s an affiliate of Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Xpeng, raised an eyebrow-raising $500 million in a Series A round. The company said it will use the funds to acquire top-tier talent, advance R&D and “continue to gain airworthiness provision and certification” as it advances toward the next generation of its vehicles, according to Deli Zhao, founder and president of the company. The company recently revealed its fifth-generation flying vehicle, the Xpeng X2, which can handle autonomous flight take-off and landing for certain city scenarios, back-end scheduling, charging and flight control. The company says it wants to provide UAM solutions for individual consumers, rather than businesses, which would certainly be in line with Xpeng’s goals. Other deals that got my attention … AirGarage, a startup that works with parking real estate owners and offers a full-stack software and management service for their lot or garage, closed a $12.5 million Series A round led by a16z, with participation from existing investors Floodgate, Founders Fund and Abstract Ventures. AirGarage has more than 200 locations across 30 states under its management. Alaska Airlines launched a new venture capital arm, dubbed Alaska Star Ventures. The aim is to find and invest in emerging technologies to help decarbonize air travel. Its first investment was to put $15 million into the Los Angeles-based UP.Partners’ inaugural venture fund. UP.Partners’ $230 million early-stage fund is focused on mobility technologies. Woven Capital, the investment arm of Toyota Motor’s Woven Planet Group, Standard Industries, Hillwood and OSM Maritime have also invested in the UP.Partners fund. Ally Financial, the automotive finance giant, plans to acquire credit card company Fair Square Financial for $750 million, reported Automotive News. BMW i Ventures invested an undisclosed amount into Our Next Energy Inc., a Michigan-based energy storage solutions company working to develop longer range, lower cost batteries for electric vehicles. FlixMobility, the $3 billion-German transportation startup, showed it’s pretty darned interested in the U.S. market. The company agreed to acquire Greyhound Lines, the iconic U.S. bus network, from U.K.-based owner FirstGroup. The deal, which includes a vehicle fleet, trademarks and related assets and liabilities, has an enterprise value on a debt-free/cash-free basis of $46 million, with an unconditional deferred consideration of $32 million with an interest rate of 5% per annum alongside that.* (Check out Ingrid Lunden’s article to get deeper into the details, including what that * is all about) Flock Freight, the trucking logistics company, raised a $215 million Series D round led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2, making it the industry’s most recent unicorn at a valuation of more than $1 billion. Gatik, the autonomous vehicle startup, reached a strategic lease and vehicle maintenance agreement with Ryder System, Freightwaves reported. River, an Indian startup focused on the electric two-wheeler market, came out of stealth with $2 million in backing from Maniv Mobility and TrucksVC. Yummy, the Venezuelan delivery super app founded in 2020, raised $18 million in a Series A round aimed at accelerating the company’s proposed expansion throughout Latin America. Anthos Capital led the latest round, with additional participation from JAM Fund, whose founder Justin Mateen was an investor in the startup’s $4 million seed round. Policy corner Hello everyone! Welcome back to Policy Corner. The big news this week is the appointment of Missy Cummings, former Navy fighter pilot and engineering professor at Duke University, to a senior safety advisory role at the nation’s top vehicle safety regulator. This kind of appointment might not typically get much notice from the general public. But Tesla fans sure did (side note from transportation editor and The Station creator Kirsten Korosec: the AV industry absolutely took notice; they just didn’t comment publicly). The reaction from a community of Tesla owners and shareholders was loud — a torrent of concern and vitriol that frothed forth on Twitter and that at times devolved into attacks on Cummings gender and character. Cummings has been a vocal critic of Tesla’s Autopilot advanced driver assistance system, and more recently, its rollout of the “Full Self-Driving” beta program to thousands of drivers across the United States. On the McKinsey Global Institute podcast last month, she called attention to what she referred to as “mode confusion,” or when the driver doesn’t have sufficient understanding of the capabilities (and limitations) of a system. “We’ve known about this for a long time in aviation, but this is new learning for the automotive world,” she said on the podcast. “We see this when people think that Autopilot and Full Self-Driving actually mean those things, and people climb in the backseat or take their hands off the steering wheel and don’t realize the trouble they’re in, and the car crashes.” Just as news of the appointment was circulating, Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted “Objectively, her track record is extremely biased against Tesla.” That tweet fanned the growing flames of dissent from Tesla fans, many of whom are also shareholders. A petition has even been circulated on Change.org requesting her removal. Supporters of Tesla have also called attention to Cummings’ service on the board of Veoneer, a Tier 1 company that supplies automakers with advanced driver assistance software and the accompanying hardware such as radars, lidars, thermal night vision cameras and other vision systems. It’s the lidar — a sensor that most in the industry with the exception of Tesla believe is required to offer fully automated driving — that triggered Tesla fans. Qualcomm recently reached an agreement to acquire Veoneer. Her critics suggest that the National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration may take a more conservative stance on ADAS and Tesla in the future. (It should be noted that NHTSA has in the past has generally taken rather laissez faire approach with Tesla; anything beyond that will seem as if the regulatory gates have come crashing down on the automaker.) It is unclear whether she will take an advisory role in the investigation into Autopilot currently underway at NHTSA, which was opened following 12 incidents of Teslas crashing into parked emergency vehicles. Kirsten here with a side note on this issue: Missy Cummings first protected and then ended up deleting her Twitter account because she was not just trolled; she received death threats, which are being investigated, according to my sources. Update: FSD software beta was rolled back Sunday. Musk tweeted Sunday “Seeing some issues with 10.3, so rolling back to 10.2 temporarily. Please note, this is to be expected with beta software. It is impossible to test all hardware configs in all conditions with internal QA, hence public beta.” The other piece of news that caught my eye this week …. Uber and Lyft have been lobbying the government to include provisions to boost electric vehicle adoption in the $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation bill currently being debated in Congress. The two ride-hailing giants have made sweeping, ambitious pledges that all rides booked on their platforms will be taken in an electric vehicle by 2030 — a goal that each company is unlikely to reach without hefty government support. Both companies consider cost and lack of charging infrastructure to be two key obstacles to larger EV uptake, according to reporting from E&E News. And it’s true that for many, electric vehicles remain prohibitively expensive, especially compared to the plethora of used internal combustion engine vehicles available… well, basically anywhere. “Our population of drivers who use our app, they are coming from lower-income communities, and they’re serving mobility in urban areas,” Adam Gromis, a sustainability policy manager with Uber, told E&E News. “So for us, we want to see slow charging in underserved neighborhoods and multiunit dwellings, and we want to see fast charging in urban areas and areas of high mobility demand. According to the spending transparency platform OpenSecrets, Uber and Lyft have each spent close to $1 million so far in the first half of the year on lobbying efforts, though each employed fewer lobbyists overall. Data on third quarter lobbying spending is not yet available. — Aria Alamalhodaei Notable reads and other tidbits Keeping this short — and a bit of a mishmash — this week. Elon Musk’s Boring Company received initial approval to build a transportation system that would shuttle passengers in Tesla vehicles via a network of tunnels under Las Vegas. The special use permit and franchise agreement would allow the Boring Company to expand its Vegas Loop system beyond its current 1.7-mile footprint that connects the Las Vegas Convention Center campus to a 29-mile route with 51 stations that would include stops at casinos along the Las Vegas Strip, the city’s football stadium and UNLV. It would eventually reach the McCarran International Airport. Lyft released its first and long overdue safety report. Miles, the universal rewards app that lets users earn miles for every mile traveled, has launched in Japan. The expansion aims to build off of Miles’ marketplace, which now offers users 500 personalized rewards from 350 brands, including Garmin, Hulu, Japan Airlines, Red Bull and Under Armour. Motional, the autonomous vehicle joint venture between Hyundai Motor Group and Aptiv, is partnering with Transport for New South Wales too help the Australian state better understand the technology and possibilities that come with a driverless ride-hail service. Plus, self-driving truck technology developer, said it plans to expand into Europe. The company has hired Bosch veteran Sun-Mi “Sunny” Choi as senior director of business development to accelerate that European expansion. Rivian, which filed to go public, said in a recent regulatory filing that it expects to record a quarterly net loss of up to $1.28 billion due to costs associated with the start of production of its debut truck. The net loss for the period ended Sept. 30 will range from $1.18 billion to $1.28 billion, according to the preliminary results. Stellantis, the automaker formed through a merger with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Groupe PSA, reached a preliminary deal with LG Energy Solution to produce battery cells and modules in North America. Tesla continued its profitability streak, reporting net income of $1.62 billion in the third quarter. That’s a nearly fivefold increase from the $331 million it earned in the same period last year. The record-setting profit came thanks to record sales and despite a global chip shortage and supply chain constraints that have affected the industry. Notably, Tesla was able to earn that record net income (on a GAAP basis) even as the vast majority of its sales came from its cheaper Model Y and Model 3 electric vehicles. Wolfe Research went out and rode in an Argo AI autonomous test vehicle. The tl;dr is that they saw great progress and the vehicle was able to navigate an environment packed with cars, double parked trucks, street-cleaners, e-bikes, aggressively driven scooters, and pedestrians. “For the most part the vehicle performed complex decisions (yielding or not yielding to pedestrians, unprotected left turns, adjusting to construction),” the report said. Their takeaway: “We tested an Argo’s AV. And it reinforced our view that this technology is coming sooner, with potential for greater disruption than investors currently appreciate.” Zoox, the autonomous vehicle startup acquired last year by Amazon, is expanding to Seattle. The company plans to open in 2022 an engineering office and operations facility, which will act as a base for its autonomous vehicle testing. The company, which today employs more than 1,300 people, tests its autonomous vehicles in San Francisco, Las Vegas and Foster City, California, near its headquarters. The company started testing its autonomous vehicles on public roads in Las Vegas in 2019. I spoke to co-founder and CTO Jesse Levinson and he said Zoox has been eyeing Seattle as a test site for years. The company even completed a small pilot in the city in late 2019. The frequency of rain in the area is one of the primary reasons Zoox picked Seattle, Levinson said. Zoox has developed some advanced weather proofing, including what Levinson described as “active rain mitigation” for its sensors. “We’re very excited about that and we want to test it and validate it in the rain; Seattle is a great place for that,” Levinson said. While Zoox is setting up operations in the city where Amazon is based, Levinson emphasized that the two companies still operate separately. The Zoox office and operations hub will not be housed on the Amazon campus, for instance. Zoox will take advantage of its proximity to Amazon to work with the company on various collaborations in the future, Levinson said, describing that as an “extra bonus.”",2021-10-25

Inside Facebook’s struggle to keep young people,https://www.theverge.com/22743744/facebook-teen-usage-decline-frances-haugen-leaks,,['Alex Heath'],,,"The world’s largest social network is internally grappling with an existential crisis: an aging user base Earlier this year, a researcher at Facebook shared some alarming statistics with colleagues. Teenage users of the Facebook app in the US had declined by 13 percent since 2019 and were projected to drop 45 percent over the next two years, driving an overall decline in daily users in the company’s most lucrative ad market. Young adults between the ages of 20 and 30 were expected to decline by 4 percent during the same timeframe. Making matters worse, the younger a user was, the less on average they regularly engaged with the app. The message was clear: Facebook was losing traction with younger generations fast. The “aging up issue is real,” the researcher wrote in an internal memo. They predicted that, if “increasingly fewer teens are choosing Facebook as they grow older,” the company would face a more “severe” decline in young users than it already projected. The “aging up issue is real” The findings, echoed by other internal documents and my conversations with current and former employees, show that Facebook sees its aging user base as an existential threat to the long-term health of its business and that it’s trying desperately to correct the problem with little indication that its strategy will work. If it doesn’t correct course, the 17-year-old social network could, for the first time, lose out on an entire generation. And while Instagram remains incredibly popular with teens, Facebook’s own data shows that they are starting to engage with the app less. The internal documents are part of disclosures made to the Securities and Exchange Commission and provided to Congress in redacted form by legal counsel for Frances Haugen, an ex-Facebook employee turned prominent whistleblower. A consortium of news organizations, including The Verge, has obtained the redacted versions received by Congress. Some documents served as the basis for earlier reporting in The Wall Street Journal. Facebook’s struggle to attract users under the age of 30 has been ongoing for years, dating back to as early as 2012. But according to the documents, the problem has grown more severe recently. And the stakes are high. While it famously started as a networking site for college students, employees have predicted that the aging up of the app’s audience — now nearly 2 billion daily users — has the potential to further alienate young people, cutting off future generations and putting a ceiling on future growth. The problem explains why the company has taken such a keen interest in courting young people and even pre-teens to its main app and Instagram, spinning up dedicated youth teams to cater to them. In 2017, it debuted a standalone Messenger app for kids, and its plans for a version of Instagram for kids were recently shelved after lawmakers decried the initiative. At the same time, a rising crop of younger social networks has continued growing in popularity with young people — a phenomenon Facebook has closely tracked with its own research. In an internal presentation earlier this year, employees estimated that teens spend 2–3x more time on TikTok than on Instagram and that Snapchat is the preferred method of communicating with best friends for young people. “Our products are still widely used by teens, but we face tough competition from the likes of Snapchat and TikTok,” Joe Osborne, a Facebook spokesperson, said in response to questions about the documents cited in this story. “All social media companies want teens to use their services. We are no different.” Declining numbers In March of this year, a team of data scientists at Facebook presented the company’s chief product officer, Chris Cox, with “heath scorecards” for Facebook and Instagram’s usage among teens and young adults. Instagram was still strong with young people but losing engagement in key markets, including the US, Australia, and Japan. And the age of Facebook’s user base was increasing rapidly. “A wide range of negative associations with Facebook” “Most young adults perceive Facebook as a place for people in their 40s and 50s,” according to the presentation. “Young adults perceive content as boring, misleading, and negative. They often have to get past irrelevant content to get to what matters.” It added that they “have a wide range of negative associations with Facebook including privacy concerns, impact to their wellbeing, along with low awareness of relevant services.” The March presentation to Cox showed that, in the US, “teen acquisition is low and regressing further.” Account registrations for users under 18 were down 26 percent from the previous year in the app’s five top countries. For teens already on Facebook, the company was continuing to “see lower or worsening levels of engagement compared to older cohorts.” Messages sent by teens were down 16 percent from the previous year, while messages sent by users aged 20–30 were flat. A “particularly concerning trend,” according to one slide, was that time spent in the Facebook app by young people in the US had declined from the period before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic last year, when usage of Facebook’s services momentarily spiked across the board. Another slide described “addressing the existing engagement gap” between younger and older users, saying that people older than 30 in the US were spending, on average, 24 more minutes per day on Facebook than younger users. “Average age will continue to increase, potentially disengaging younger users even more” Facebook internally measures its user base against population estimates from the United Nations for specific countries. If the social network has the same amount of monthly users in an age bracket as what the estimates say for that region, it’s fully saturated. The presentation to Cox explained that the average Facebook user age “has been increasing disproportionately to the average population age over time. If this continues, [the Facebook app’s] average age will continue to increase, potentially disengaging younger users even more.” Instagram was doing better with young people, with full saturation in the US, France, the UK, Japan, and Australia. But there was still cause for concern. Posting by teens had dropped 13 percent from 2020 and “remains the most concerning trend,” the researchers noted, adding that the increased use of TikTok by teens meant that “we are likely losing our total share of time.” Product sprint An image from a section of an internal Facebook presentation from earlier this year called “Teen Fundamentals.” To address the growing crisis, employees at Facebook and Instagram have, for the past year, been planning a slew of products tailored for teens and young adults, according to the internal documents. But they recognize that it’s going to be an uphill battle on both platforms. “A brand tax we need to get ahead of” Young adults “feel Facebook shouldn’t be the place for rants and charged opinions, even though it seems prevalent on the platform,” according to a November 2020 strategy document about targeting young adults. “External forces such as negative media coverage further tarnish this perception,” it continued, equating to “a brand tax we need to get ahead of.” In order to address the “significant risk” of young adults engaging less and less with Facebook over time, employees last November identified two “beached” areas of focus, allowing “us to establish credibility and gain trust for extension into future areas” like mental health products. They laid out a multi-year plan to “enable young adults to connect with mentors for professional guidance” and “engage in meaningful conversations around causes to take action locally with others.” Planned features included asking young people to update their friend networks to make them more relevant since their connections “are often dormant and they struggle to realize any value” from them after collecting hundreds of friends over the years. They began work to tweak the News Feed algorithm specifically for young adults, with the goal of testing the change as early as the second half of this year, in order to show them “unconnected” content from accounts they didn’t choose to follow. The employees also discussed letting young people set different profile identities that were specific to certain Facebook groups. Other products included a more visual version of the News Feed tentatively called Spotlight and “mood feeds” to increase “visitation and engagement.” Design examples of Facebook features geared toward young people from November of last year. The documents show that, as part of its youth push, Facebook has been working on an unreleased version of Facebook Groups called Groups+, slated in the November document to begin testing as soon as this year, that is intended to let people join groups for specific personalities and “close-knit communities” as a way to “increase cultural relevance.” A whole pillar of products targeting people between the ages of 20 and 30 is focused on competing with LinkedIn, allowing people to host resumes and browse for jobs or career advice in a specialized feed. Joe Osborne, the Facebook spokesperson, said, “We continuously explore new products and experiences for people, but these efforts either evolved or never left the exploration phase.” Seven percent of teens report experiencing bullying on Instagram For Instagram, much of the product work targeting young people has recently focused on reducing the negative experiences of social comparison and bullying that they report. A presentation from earlier this year said that 7 percent of teens report experiencing bullying on Instagram and that 40 percent of all bullying happened in private messages. Other internal research documents, some of which were earlier reported on by The Wall Street Journal, show that teens have told the company they experience negative social comparison and even depression from using Instagram. Sixty-one percent of new teen accounts on Instagram choose to make their profiles private on initial setup, the presentation said, adding that Instagram employees wanted to make “nudging” product tweaks to encourage more young users to set their accounts to private. The documents show that secondary, private “finsta” accounts have also been exploding in popularity, especially among Instagram’s youngest users — behavior that employees want to encourage as a way to retain young people. Facebook’s researchers have internally set up an ongoing workstream to understand teens and what they want, as detailed in part here. “Teens seek a way to connect with their friends, but don’t want to share with all their followers,” the company’s researchers wrote in one recent document. “They want to easily share with just the people that they trust so that they feel seen, accepted, and validated.” Attracting young people and keeping them engaged remains top of mind inside Instagram. Adam Mosseri, the head of the app, in May told employees that Instagram’s goal is to be “a place where young people define themselves and the future,” according to The New York Times. An uncertain future A slide from an internal Facebook presentation earlier this year. Losing young people wasn’t always the existential threat for the blue Facebook app that it is now, according to Michael Sayman, a 25-year-old former product manager for youth products who joined the company in 2014 when he was just 17. With the rise of selfie cameras in phones, social apps became more visual while Facebook stayed mostly focused on text posts. Copying Stories from Snapchat — which reduced the pressure people feel to share everyday snippets of their lives by making them disappear — has helped keep younger users on Instagram, as has encouraging the use of multiple accounts. But Facebook’s use by young people has stayed on a consistent decline. By the time Sayman left in 2017, “the company had understood very clearly the importance,” he told me. “It’s an entire generation.” Nowadays, teens are increasingly flocking to more immersive, social game platforms like Fortnite or Sayman’s current employer, Roblox. These 3D worlds with custom avatars appeal to young people who are looking to be online without the pressure of people judging their appearance or surroundings. And while a lot of traditional social media can feel like a performance, these virtual game worlds are fun. Incidentally, Facebook is planning to rebrand its corporate name to focus on the metaverse, which could partly be an effort to try to appeal to young people again. For now, Facebook isn’t even sure if its plans to win back young people are enough. As the March presentation to Cox bluntly said: “We believe it’s too early to assess the effectiveness of our current suite of big bets for teens on Instagram and young adults on Facebook, and whether they are sufficient given the current competitive landscape.”",2021-10-25 11:00:00,,,theverge,True,"[('Earlier this year', 'DATE'), ('US', 'GPE'), ('13 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('2019', 'DATE'), ('45 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('the next two years', 'DATE'), ('daily', 'DATE'), ('between the ages of 20 and 30', 'DATE'), ('4 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('17-year-old', 'DATE'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('Instagram', 'ORG'), ('Facebook’s', 'PERSON'), ('the Securities and Exchange Commission', 'ORG'), ('Congress', 'ORG'), ('Frances Haugen', 'PERSON'), ('Congress', 'ORG'), ('The Wall Street Journal', 'ORG'), ('the age of 30', 'DATE'), ('years', 'DATE'), ('2012', 'DATE'), ('nearly 2 billion', 'MONEY'), ('daily', 'DATE'), ('Instagram', 'ORG'), ('2017', 'DATE'), ('Messenger', 'PERSON'), ('Instagram', 'ORG'), ('earlier this year', 'DATE'), ('2–3x', 'CARDINAL'), ('TikTok', 'ORG'), ('Instagram', 'PERSON'), ('Snapchat', 'PERSON'), ('Snapchat', 'PERSON'), ('TikTok', 'ORG'), ('Joe Osborne', 'PERSON'), ('March of this year', 'DATE'), ('Chris Cox', 'PERSON'), ('Facebook and Instagram’s', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('US', 'GPE'), ('Australia', 'GPE'), ('Japan', 'GPE'), ('40s', 'DATE'), ('50s', 'DATE'), ('March', 'DATE'), ('Cox', 'PERSON'), ('US', 'GPE'), ('under 18', 'DATE'), ('26 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('the previous year', 'DATE'), ('five', 'CARDINAL'), ('16 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('the previous year', 'DATE'), ('20–30', 'DATE'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('US', 'GPE'), ('last year', 'DATE'), ('Facebook’s', 'ORG'), ('older than 30', 'CARDINAL'), ('US', 'GPE'), ('24 more minutes', 'TIME'), ('the United Nations', 'ORG'), ('monthly', 'DATE'), ('Cox', 'PERSON'), ('US', 'GPE'), ('France', 'GPE'), ('UK', 'GPE'), ('Japan', 'GPE'), ('Australia', 'GPE'), ('13 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('2020', 'DATE'), ('TikTok', 'ORG'), ('earlier this year', 'DATE'), ('Teen Fundamentals', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Facebook and Instagram', 'ORG'), ('the past year', 'DATE'), ('November 2020', 'DATE'), ('last November', 'DATE'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('multi-year', 'DATE'), ('hundreds', 'CARDINAL'), ('the years', 'DATE'), ('News Feed', 'ORG'), ('Spotlight', 'PERSON'), ('November of last year', 'DATE'), ('Groups', 'ORG'), ('November', 'DATE'), ('this year', 'DATE'), ('between the ages of 20 and 30', 'DATE'), ('LinkedIn', 'ORG'), ('Joe Osborne', 'PERSON'), ('Seven percent', 'PERCENT'), ('Instagram For Instagram', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('earlier this year', 'DATE'), ('7 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('Instagram', 'ORG'), ('40 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('The Wall Street Journal', 'ORG'), ('Instagram', 'ORG'), ('Sixty-one percent', 'PERCENT'), ('Instagram', 'ORG'), ('Instagram', 'ORG'), ('Instagram', 'ORG'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('Instagram', 'ORG'), ('Adam Mosseri', 'PERSON'), ('May', 'DATE'), ('Instagram’s', 'PERSON'), ('The New York Times', 'ORG'), ('earlier this year', 'DATE'), ('Michael Sayman', 'PERSON'), ('25-year-old', 'DATE'), ('2014', 'DATE'), ('17', 'CARDINAL'), ('Instagram', 'ORG'), ('Sayman', 'PERSON'), ('2017', 'DATE'), ('Fortnite', 'PERSON'), ('Sayman', 'PERSON'), ('Roblox', 'PERSON'), ('March', 'DATE'), ('Cox', 'ORG'), ('Instagram', 'PERSON')]"

And for iPhone users, you’ll need to be on iOS 10 or later. Most read in Phones & Gadgets GONE WITHOUT A TRACE Genius WhatsApp trick lets you send messages that vanish after 7 days TAKE TWO Insiders think they've found Facebook's new name just 'days before rebrand' PICTURE PERFECT Simple trick makes your WhatsApp photos look much better in seconds CALL ENDED WhatsApp to STOP working on some Android and iPhone models – is yours one? APP HORROR I found a WhatsApp scam that can hack you in seconds – don't fall for this BUTTON BASHER WhatsApp just added a genius new button on your chats – here's how it works On the Android front, that means a host of popular phones will lose access, including the Samsung Galaxy S3 and the Huawei Ascend Mate. For Apple, you’ll lose access on an iPhone 4 or older. And if you’ve never updated your iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus or iPhone SE (2016), you’ll lose access until you update. That’s because they launched on iOS 9. But you can update all three models to iOS 15 – the latest version – and keep access to WhatsApp. Tech companies regularly stop supporting older devices. Google did just that with old Android phones for Gmail, YouTube and Google Maps. Sometimes it’s because it’s simply not cost-efficient to keep apps working on very old versions of iOS or Android. That’s especially the case if only a small percentage of users are running these old versions of software. Using outdated software can also be a huge security risk – so it’s important you update, or upgrade if you can’t. In other news, check out our iPhone 13 review and iPhone 13 Pro review.

Using a basic chatbot interface, people can ask questions and get answers about their illness. The startup recently raised a $11.6 million (€10 million) funding round from Digital Health Ventures, Impact Partners, as well as existing investors Investir&+ and BADGE’s business angels. Wefight has developed a different app for each chronic illness. They’re all based on the same virtual assistant called Vik. There are currently more than a dozen apps about depression, asthma, multiple cancers, etc. Essentially, Vik acts as an interface between the patient and Wefight’s content. The company has developed everything in-house, from natural-language processing technology to the framework that Wefight leverages to create new apps. Every time a patient asks a question, the service tries to understand the meaning of the question and finds relevant information in the knowledge database. It can then relay and serve content to the patient. Content has been written by professional pharmacists and tries to be as informative and neutral as possible. This way, you don’t necessarily have to wait for your next doctor’s appointment to go through your list of questions. “Vik isn’t going to replace someone in the care pathway. It’s there to fill a gap,” co-founder and CEO Benoit Brouard told me. And it seems like there’s a gap indeed. More than 400,000 people have tried the service so far. Vik has delivered 5 million answers. There are 70 people working for Wefight right now. Wefight tries to find new users by talking with patient organizations. When it comes to the business model, Wefight works with pharmaceutical companies to finance new apps. Turning a treatment into a commercial success involves making sure that patients can identify the chronic illness they’re suffering from. And Vik acts as a top-of-the-funnel content provider. “We reduce clinical inertia. When a lab decides to finance Vik Asthma, the lab doesn’t have any influence on the content that we create,” Brouard said. “Laboratories want patients who suffer from asthma to go and see a pulmonologist,” he added. This way, the pool of patients who could potentially end up buying a specific drug is bigger. It’s a convoluted sales strategy for pharmaceutical companies. But something like Vik could improve the quality of life of patients. With today’s funding round, the company plans to expand to other countries with a new office in Berlin. Every time Wefight launches an app in a new market, the company hires local health professionals and contact local patient organizations. It’s a long process, but that’s how Wefight can get it right for patients all around the world.",2021-10-25 07:10:26,,,techcrunch,True,"[('French', 'NORP'), ('more than a dozen', 'CARDINAL'), ('$11.6 million', 'MONEY'), ('€10 million', 'MONEY'), ('Digital Health Ventures', 'ORG'), ('BADGE', 'ORG'), ('Vik', 'PERSON'), ('more than a dozen', 'CARDINAL'), ('Vik', 'PERSON'), ('Wefight', 'ORG'), ('Content', 'ORG'), ('Vik', 'PERSON'), ('Benoit Brouard', 'PERSON'), ('More than 400,000', 'CARDINAL'), ('Vik', 'PERSON'), ('5 million', 'CARDINAL'), ('70', 'CARDINAL'), ('Vik', 'PERSON'), ('Vik Asthma', 'PERSON'), ('Brouard', 'ORG'), ('Vik', 'PERSON'), ('today', 'DATE'), ('Berlin', 'GPE')]"

SoftBank’s Latin American Fund and GGV participated as new investors, in addition to existing backers Kaszek, BigBets, Nubank CEO David Velez and Kavak CEO Carlos Garcia Ottati. In May, Justos had announced a $2.8 million seed raise that included participation from Kaszek, one of the largest and most active VC firms in Latin America, and the CEOs of several unicorns including Assaf Wand, CEO and co-founder of Hippo Insurance; Sergio Furio, founder and CEO of Creditas; Patrick Sigrist, founder of iFood and Fritz Lanman, CEO of ClassPass. Senior executives from Robinhood, Stripe, Wise, Carta and Capital One had also put money in the round. Serial entrepreneurs Dhaval Chadha, Jorge Soto Moreno and Antonio Molins co-founded Justos, having most recently worked at various Silicon Valley-based companies including ClassPass, Netflix and Airbnb. The trio, ironically none of whom are Brazilian, ​​met while playing soccer on an amateur team in San Francisco. The fact that Justos has yet to officially launch its product and has already attracted such a large group of high-profile investors is notable. According to CEO Chadha, its launch is “imminent,” and the company already has 12,000 “leads” on its waitlist. So far, it has launched a driving test and quoting app and in advance of its formal launch, it has been collecting data from the driving test. The process to get insurance in the country, by any accounts, is a slow one. It takes up to 72 hours to receive initial coverage and two weeks to receive the final insurance policy. Insurers also take their time in resolving claims related to car damages and loss due to accidents, the entrepreneurs say. They also charge that pricing is often not fair or transparent. Justos aims to improve the whole auto insurance process in Brazil by measuring the way people drive to help price their insurance policies. Similar to Root here in the U.S., Justos intends to collect users’ data through their mobile phones so that it can “more accurately and assertively price different types of risk.” This way, the startup claims it can offer plans that are up to 30% cheaper than traditional plans, and grant discounts each month, according to the driving patterns of the previous month of each customer. “We measure how safely people drive using the sensors on their cell phones,” Chadha told me at the time of the company’s last raise. “This allows us to offer cheaper insurance to users who drive well, thereby reducing biases that are inherent in the pricing models used by traditional insurance companies.” Justos also plans to use artificial intelligence and computerized vision to analyze and process claims more quickly and machine learning for image analysis and to create bots that help accelerate claims processing. The company also has a social good component. The startup has agreed to support five nonprofit organizations in its first year: Instituto Ayrton Senna (education), AACD (disability), Gerando Falcões (economic opportunity), Casa 1 (LGBTQ) and Conexsus (sustainable development in the Amazon). It intends to cap its profit so part of the amount that is not used to pay claims is donated to those institutions in its first year of operations. Says the company: “The partnerships reinforce the insurtech’s disruptive vision, which, as its name suggests, aims to build a more transparent relationship with its customers and effectively contribute to improving society.” The insurtech plans to use its new capital to continue to hire, and expand its area of operations, as well as toward launching other lines of insurance. The startup has a team of 30 with the goal of having 50 employees by year’s end and 200 by the end of 2022. Nick Shalek, general partner at Ribbit Capital, said his firm invested in Justos “because of the huge market opportunity and the caliber and technical prowess of the team.” “With over 20 years of experience in Silicon Valley as entrepreneurs and at Netflix, Airbnb and ClassPass, we believe that the Justos team is well positioned to reinvent insurance in Latin America by focusing on creating customer value, lowering prices and expanding the market,” he wrote via e-mail.

Photographer: James ... [+] MacDonald/Bloomberg © 2021 Bloomberg Finance LP In the run up to COP 26, awareness of the climate crisis and the importance of an effective corporate response is at its height. Yet EcoAct has released its 6 th annual analysis of climate reporting showing that 81% of FTSE 100 companies don’t yet have a robust climate plan. EcoAct released The Climate Reporting Performance of the FTSE 100, Euro STOXX 50 and DOW 30 . The report, which ranked the top 20 companies for climate disclosure, found that just 19% of the FTSE 100 have long-term emissions reduction targets to meet net-zero goals and only 3% have a long-term emissions reduction target aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5°C. The challenge is the growing mainstream acceptance of the need for a net zero target, without either having put a plan to achieve the goal in place, or have the capacity to implement it. While its positive that the number of FTSE 100 companies committing to net zero is up from 45% to 66% in a year, a third have yet to make any such commitment. At the same time, perhaps of greatest concern given the need for at least 50% cuts in emissions by 2030 if we are to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, even amongst those who have made a net zero commitment, few have made any provision for carbon sequestration or removal. Carbon reduction is a must, offsetting only when necessary but its unlikely the world will reach net zero by 2050 without removal. And the issue of carbon offset in terms of type, permanence, double-counting, and so on, remains contentious. As Stuart Lemmon, managing director of EcoAct says, the issue is that while emissions reduction has moved from a ‘good to have’ to a necessity, companies are still scrambling to keep up with the requirements of a credible, achievable emissions target. He says, “The driver behind the report is to find and celebrate best practice, challenging companies to do more and better. There is increasingly a lot of good ambitious, long-term thinking in the corporate sector, and that should be highlighted.” MORE FOR YOU Is Carbon Capture Another Fossil Fuel Industry Con? Sustainable Fashion Wants Brands To Redefine Business Growth Trouble With Predicting Future Of Transportation Is That Today Gets In The Way Lemmon says, ““Our analysis shows that when businesses have a clear framework to follow, the uptake on climate change action is vastly accelerated.” A word of caution though, as he adds, “There is evidence that the corporate sector is stepping up but many haven’t yet grasped the need for long term change. We need a transition pathway to get 80-90% reduction in emissions by 2050 and many don’t have targets past 2030.” In terms of different markets, the FTSE is doing better than the DOW 30 or Euro STOXX 50, where 63% and 64% have committed to net zero respectively. But less than a fifth of these listed businesses have long-term reduction targets to achieve this commitment, and only 2% have strategies in place that will achieve emissions reductions in line with 1.5°C. Nor is enough is being done to tackle value chain emissions – a critical issue where Scope 3 emissions can by up to 98% of a company’s footprint. Across all indices, 65% of companies have set a Scope 1 & 2 SBT while only 39% of companies have set one for their Scope 3 emissions. Of the 178 companies scored this year, only AstraZeneca, Vodafone, Apple, and SAP SE have successfully set 1.5⁰C aligned Scope 1, 2 and 3 SBTi validated SBTs. 65% of companies across all indices have now set an SBT, a 26% increase on 2020 (with the addition of Euro STOXX in 2021). Furthermore, many more of these SBTs are in line with a well below 2⁰C or 1.5⁰C scenario – from 20% last year to 51% this year. Globally, top performers across all indices (FTSE 100, DOW 30 and Euro STOXX 50) this year were Microsoft, Apple, Landsec, Vodafone and Schneider Electric. There are many listed companies with differing levels of significance in terms of footprint and climate impact. That makes it increasingly important to understand what each approach means, in terms of actions required, credibility and impact. Historically targets on emissions, when they existed at all, were often benchmarked against competitors, or identified based on what companies thought they could do rather than identifying an agreed goal for long term reduction with concrete actions outlined and implemented. In terms of the different approaches, the TCFD is an excellent first step in identifying the financial impact of climate risk. Developed by The Financial Stability Board (FSB), the TCFD recommendations provide a clear example of how governments globally can come together to create a framework that achieves a common climate goal. New Zealand has just implemented mandatory reporting for listed companies under TCFD, and the UK has announced it is to follow. SBTs, which Lemmon describes as a ‘step-change’, are about understanding the impact of business operations on the environment. It provides best practice for tackling emissions but only provides validation for 15 years. Sensible given how rapidly the technology, policy and investment frameworks are evolving, but still a relatively short-term goal in terms of society’s needs. Both the TCFD and the SBTs do a good job of setting a clear standard that drives action. What net zero does however is reframe the goal completely. Lemmon says, “Net zero stops being an incremental target and becomes an absolute end point. It requires every part of the business to transform, and long-term transitional thinking.” Only such thinking drives deep corporate transformation, thinking about the costs over time, when it can be achieved and the most effective strategy for achieving it. There is no doubt that reporting on climate plans is complex and challenging. There are different standards that can be used - SBT itself is launching its Global Net Zero Standard next week. Awareness of the importance interaction between climate and nature, work on nature-based emissions solutions, natural capital accounting are only going to increase pressure on the corporate sector as investors struggle to understand the long term, as well as the short and medium term, issues. In the end though, it is only by putting claims under scrutiny that governance will improve. If we demand transparency and clarity, then we need globally agreed standards to make things easier. There is no question that we’re taking steps in the right direction but with only eight years to halve global emissions, we need to move farther and faster now. Of course, the hopes of many lie in the hands of the negotiators at COP26. The hope that there will be a credible global net zero agreement, one that will see governments commit to emissions reduction pathways that inform the deployment of capital. That will drive financial commitments and corporate action. Without credible and robust commitments the impact that TCFD, SBT and net zero target requirements are having on the private sector may falter.

Read More","Foxtel, who is moving to strengthen their position in the Australian entertainment market, as consumer move to invest in multiple streaming and content deals, has expanded their management team with the appointment as a consultant of a seasoned US TV and streaming Company executive. Randy Freer is a former Fox Networks executive who ran streaming service Hulu for two and a half years until early 2020, according to sources he will work with Foxtel CEO Patrick Delany to expand Foxtel content offerings, while helping existing management to improve revenue generation. New Foxtel services will shortly include ViacomCBS-owned streaming service Paramount+ and online video service 10Play on its set-top boxes. Also available next year will be Amazon Prime. The big benefit to existing Foxtel customers is that the integration of third-party content deals, into the Foxtel operating systems delivers a smoother service for subscribers eliminating clunky fast forwarding and difficult searches often found when apps with these services are loaded onto TV’s. Appointing Free is seen as a smart move claim observer, especially as it is well known that Foxtel is testing the waters for a potential float of Foxtel who recently launched a new iQ5 box for subscribers that are still on cable. iQ4 customers are also getting a major software upgrade as Australia’s largest subscription TV service gets set to roll out a Summer of Cricket in Ultra High Definition 4K. This will significantly enhance the viewing experience for Cricket fans over what free to air content providers of the same sporting event are able to deliver. According to sources Freer is well known to News Corp the largest shareholder in Foxtel through his role as president and chief operating officer (COO) at Fox Networks Group, where he oversaw revenue and distribution. He was also the president and COO of Fox Sports Media Group, where he led negotiations for major broadcast rights deals including the National Football League and Major League Baseball. “Freer is an appointment that will go down well with potential investors and with content providers who have to make a choice of whether they will go it alone in the Australian market or via a relationship with Foxtel who have access to News Corp marketing resources” said one observer with knowledge of the Australian market. His advice to Foxtel management and his existing relationship with international media companies is seen as being “invaluable” especially as he ran Hula and was there when the business was sold to Disney by News Corp owned 21st Century Fox. Foxtel sources have indicated 9Now owned by archrival Nine Entertainment is likely to be the next service to be integrated into the Foxtel platform. The sources said the deal is in the final stages according to the Sydney Morning Herald. Commercial broadcasters are increasingly concerned that creators of smart TV devices are making international streaming services easier to access and use than local apps such as 10Play, 9Now and 7Plus. Local broadcasters are asking government to find a way to ensure they will take precedence over international services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video on these devices. Foxtel boss Patrick Delany said that at a time when prominence and access for local players are concerns, Australian media companies needed to come together, and that Foxtel could help address these issues.",2021-10-24 20:35:36,,,channelnews,True,"[('Australian', 'NORP'), ('US', 'GPE'), ('Randy Freer', 'PERSON'), ('Fox Networks', 'ORG'), ('two and a half years', 'DATE'), ('early 2020', 'DATE'), ('Foxtel', 'ORG'), ('Patrick Delany', 'PERSON'), ('Foxtel', 'ORG'), ('New Foxtel', 'ORG'), ('ViacomCBS', 'ORG'), ('10Play', 'CARDINAL'), ('next year', 'DATE'), ('Amazon', 'ORG'), ('Foxtel', 'ORG'), ('third', 'ORDINAL'), ('Foxtel', 'ORG'), ('Foxtel', 'ORG'), ('Foxtel', 'ORG'), ('iQ5', 'NORP'), ('Australia', 'GPE'), ('Summer of Cricket', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Cricket', 'ORG'), ('Freer', 'ORG'), ('News Corp', 'ORG'), ('Foxtel', 'ORG'), ('COO', 'ORG'), ('Fox Networks Group', 'ORG'), ('COO', 'ORG'), ('Fox Sports Media Group', 'ORG'), ('the National Football League', 'ORG'), ('Major League Baseball', 'ORG'), ('Australian', 'NORP'), ('Foxtel', 'ORG'), ('News Corp', 'ORG'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('Australian', 'NORP'), ('Foxtel', 'ORG'), ('Hula', 'PERSON'), ('Disney by News Corp', 'ORG'), ('21st Century Fox', 'ORG'), ('9Now', 'CARDINAL'), ('Nine Entertainment', 'ORG'), ('Foxtel', 'ORG'), ('the Sydney Morning Herald', 'EVENT'), ('10Play', 'CARDINAL'), ('9Now', 'CARDINAL'), ('Netflix', 'GPE'), ('Amazon', 'ORG'), ('Patrick Delany', 'PERSON'), ('Australian', 'NORP'), ('Foxtel', 'ORG')]"
Windows XP turns 20: Microsoft's rise and fall points to one thing — don't fix what isn't broken,https://theconversation.com/windows-xp-turns-20-microsofts-rise-and-fall-points-to-one-thing-dont-fix-what-isnt-broken-166493,,"['Erica Mealy', ' Lecturer in Computer Science', ' University of the Sunshine Coast']",,,"ShutterstockTwenty years on from the public release of Windows XP, the popular operating system is still regarded one of Microsoft’s greatest achievements. As of August this year, Windows XP still maintained a greater market share than its successor, Windows Vista. When mainstream support for XP ended in April 2009, it was running on a huge 75% of Windows computers and about 19% of people were still using XP when extended security support finished in 2014. Microsoft provided security support in a few special cases, such as for military use, until 2019 — an incredible 18 years after the initial release. But what made XP excel? And what has Microsoft learned in the two decades since its release? Read more: Airports, ATMs, hospitals: Microsoft Windows XP leak would be less of an issue, if so many didn't use it The rise and rise of Windows XP Windows XP launched on October 25, 2001, during a golden age at Microsoft when the company was achieving its highest revenues yet, dominated the PC market, and had taken a strong lead over Netscape in the browser wars (after the latter led the race through the 1990s). XP also came at a time when more people than ever were buying their first personal computer. These personal and business computers arrived with a full suite of Microsoft software pre-installed and ready to use. As a result, the Windows operating system defined many people’s computing experience. Microsoft has long relied on Intel and AMD processor chips for its devices, but last year announced plans to make its own. Shutterstock Built on the core of the highly successful Windows NT operating system (also the foundation for Windows 2000), Windows XP provided an option which, for the first time, looked and felt the same whether it was being used at home or at work. The prioritisation of users’ needs in this way represented a watershed moment for Microsoft, and was a key ingredient in the long reign of XP. XP also featured several innovations including the introduction of the Microsoft Error Reporting platform. Earlier versions of Windows had become infamous for the so-called “blue screen of death” that appeared when the system encountered an error. XP replaced this with a small pop-up to collect data about the error and send it to Microsoft’s engineers to help them improve the software. The original ‘blue screen of death’ from Windows NT would have been largely nonsensical for most people. The most current version of this screen includes a sad-face emoticon and a QR code for troubleshooting. Wikimedia During the tenure of XP, Microsoft also launched Visual Studio .NET, a software suite for building new Windows programs. This combined all their developer tools for a variety of programming languages, including Visual C++ and Visual Basic, and the new “object-oriented” language C# – a rival to the popular Java language. This was further evidence of changing attitudes at Microsoft; the company was centred on prioritising users. But it didn’t last. The fall of Vista and Windows 7 In 2007, Windows Vista — the successor to XP — was released. It was considered an inferior, bloated and unusable system by many commentators, including Time magazine. Designed for high-powered computers, Vista was often excruciatingly slow and frustrating to use on older machines that comfortably ran XP. Windows 7 followed Vista in 2009, confronting users with massive changes. It initially forced users on computers with a keyboard and mouse into a tablet-style interaction on the home screen. The familiar icons and desktop format vanished. Instead, users were greeted with differently-sized tiles, and scrolling mechanisms that were perfect for touch-screens but awkward for mouse navigation. It seemed Microsoft no longer had users’ wishes as its priority. It wasn’t until the release of Windows 8 in 2012 that the company returned to its user-first paradigm. And this change was spurred in no small part by having to compete with Apple’s MacOS (Macbooks), iOS (iPhones and iPads) and Android phones and tablets. Branching away from PCs Although released at the same time as Windows XP, Microsoft’s first tablet offering was widely regarded a failure too. The Windows XP tablet was based on a cut-down operating system and a completely different family of processors. The tablet’s system was hamstrung by connectivity issues related to its need for consistent and stable internet connection (which even now is not a given in the mobile world). It was also incompatible with existing software offerings. A similar story unfolded in the mobile phone space. Early Windows phones such as Windows Phone 7, released in 2010 without many basic functions such as copy and paste, were never serious competitors for Apple’s iPhones or Google’s Android phones. In 2013 Microsoft purchased Nokia’s mobile and devices division (later abandoned and resold in 2016), but its phones were still unsuccessful. Although Windows phones are still available, Microsoft changed lanes in 2014. Incoming chief executive Satya Nadella said the new agenda was “mobile first, cloud first”, meaning cloud-connected mobile computing was the focus. Nadella outlined a desire to create a Windows NT for the internet. This is something the Microsoft Azure cloud-computing service and Surface Pro tablet — now with the same processors as its PC cousins and the ability to run without a constant internet connection — have achieved. Microsoft Azure allows services such as virtual computing, storage and networking, all of which is managed through Microsoft’s own data centres. Shutterstock Cloud or service-oriented computing means you can use any type of device to access your operating system (known as “platform as a service”), and office productivity tools such as Office365 (“software as a service”). Azure represents a return to Microsoft providing computing that serves the needs of businesses and people. If it’s not broken, don’t fix it Modern computing is a balance between portability, power consumption, usability and speed, among other factors. Companies can no longer just throw advanced hardware at a problem and expect the public to tolerate poor user experience. The success of XP, and subsequent failures of its successors, present many lessons to the technology sector — the chief of which is this: if it’s not broken, don’t fix it. By acknowledging earlier mistakes and reverting to a user-first policy, Microsoft could indeed secure its place in the market for decades to come.

According to the court documents, the lawsuit was filed on October 21st in California. Solonchenko collected the data by exploiting Facebook Messenger’s contact import feature. Between January 2018 to September 2019, he used an automated tool to pose as Android devices and fed Facebook millions of telephone numbers. Facebook would then give Solonchenko data on which numbers had Facebook accounts. He also said that his parser did not work for all profiles, as it depended on each account’s publicity settings. Fortunately for us, Facebook discontinued the contact import feature back in 2019, right after they found out what Solonchenko was doing. Credit: Facebook On December 1 2020, the programmer sold the data on RaidForums, a cybercrime forum he usually frequents under the usernames “Solomame” and “barak_obama”. According to Facebook, Solonchenko had already sold the data of millions to multiple companies beforehand. “Since 2020, Solonchenko has sold stolen or scraped data from Ukraine’s largest commercial bank, Ukraine’s largest private delivery service, and a French data analytics company,” Facebook detailed in the court documents. In the lawsuit, Facebook asked for unspecified damages and for Solonchenko to be banned from using Facebook’s services. This incident is far from Facebook’s first privacy scandal. The Wikipedia page for “Privacy concerns with Facebook” has 36 sections. Back in April, a group of hackers utilised the same feature to scrape data from 533 million Facebook users.

5 changes social-audio apps should consider making now,https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/24/5-changes-social-audio-apps-should-consider-making-now/,"['Apps', 'Column', 'Opinion', 'Social', 'TC', 'clubhouse', 'internet culture', 'social audio', 'social media']",['Annie Saunders'],,Social-audio apps need to leverage the same strategies used by major news organizations.,"Adonica Shaw Contributor Share on Twitter Adonica Shaw is founder of Wingwomen, a health-and-wellness-focused social media platform for professional women. More posts by this contributor 10 ways founders can manage their mental health while fundraising As social-audio apps like Clubhouse, Beams, Pludo, Racket and Quest have gained popularity in the last year, more marketers, product teams and up-and-coming competitors are beginning to explore the strategies that are making and breaking the user experience in this space. On one side, these products were fairly straightforward when they first hit the market because content creators could simply sign up, create audio rooms or short-form podcasts, and then set a time for a broadcast. But as more and more negative user feedback bubbles to the top of internet forums, now is a good stopping point to consider just how “social” social audio should be. We know social audio isn’t meant to imitate YouTube, Twitter or Facebook, whose user experiences are largely built around one-way communication. But if we exclude them, who should social-audio companies consider while developing their strategy? Given my background in television and marketing, it should come as no surprise that I believe social audio needs to leverage the same strategies used by major news organizations. Based on my experience, here are five of the easiest ways social-audio app teams can do it. Organize for inclusion When we think about the design of apps, the things that typically come to mind are the placement of the hamburger stack, the font types and the ease of the ability of the user to get in and out of their account. But what we rarely think about is how the design supports or doesn’t support disabled users. A notable — and reasonable — concern that emerged last year as social audio took off was the lack of accessibility features for people with impaired sight or hearing. Small text makes it harder for people with impaired vision to navigate the apps, and the lack of captioning makes it difficult for those who are deaf to enjoy the conversations. If you think about it, restaurants and movie theaters typically have a way for patrons to use a different menu in Braille or larger print, or they offer captioning for audience members who need an additional layer of support to enjoy the show. Social audio app teams and designers should include accessibility checkpoints in the workflow to address these concerns early in the development road map. In the first year, leverage journalists and hosts Marketing social-audio apps to content creators is a great way to pull in early adopters, but it could be better to identify experienced hosts and journalists that are willing to work with your brand in its beta stage as well. Why? Because when you’re building an app that will eventually take up a portion of the media market, credibility is king. Content creation and credibility aren’t mutually exclusive. And vetting by experienced journalists and hosts who have experience producing live shows and moderating public feedback can improve the audience’s experience. Not to mention, if you start with a lineup of talent that knows the ropes, you can buy yourself time on the user education offerings. By having credible figureheads lead your conversations, they will also set the tone for how creators who are onboarded after them should use the platform effectively. Mimic big media What do Spotify, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, ABC, NBC, CBS and the BBC all have in common? Programming. If someone wants to know what’s coming on at 8 o’clock tonight on ABC, it’s easy for them to find out and set aside time to watch a show. With Netflix, audiences know about changes in the lineup weeks if not months in advance. Consider having a lineup of rooms or shows that are produced by in-house talent. This way, the user audience has a reason to be on the platform even if their favorite creators are on hiatus. Yes, some content creators are savvy enough to let their audience know when they will be back, but not all have the support of a producer or experienced team to make sure they can maintain a presence. At first glance, this doesn’t seem like a big issue to the app teams, because you’re betting on the content creator to come back and bring their audience. But this is where the apps are actually losing engagement: If the creators aren’t consistent and the audience doesn’t know when to expect them back, and the user doesn’t receive suggestions to similar audio rooms or shows quickly, they lose interest and stop returning. And later, when they are asked why they stopped using the platforms, their review is typically negative because they didn’t see the continued value. When creators receive complaints, educate immediately When entertainers mess up, all it takes is a few groups of people to air their concerns, and before you know it, their career takes a huge hit. Sometimes this happens because the content creator has acted maliciously, but other times it’s due to honest mistakes or sheer ignorance. Here’s the thing: If you’re swift to remove the creator, not only does it tarnish their career, but it strips others in the community of the education needed about what to do in a similar circumstance — and how to reconcile the initial concerns privately and publicly. Given the live nature of these platforms, these snafus are guaranteed to pop up, and for that reason, it’s a good idea to figure out how to address issues in a way that’s supportive to all involved. The suggestion here is to either create a training program that the content creator would have to complete before they are allowed to return to the platform, or your company can partner with online or in-person training courses to educate people on topics relating to things like race, culture or social issues. I liken it to getting a ticket for a moving violation and being required to attend traffic school. These app teams should think of a similar solution that allows creators to navigate being in the public eye and learning as they go. Not all content creators are trained as journalists. If they are targeted in the marketing, there should be a strategy to retain them as active participants on the platform, even after mistakes come up. Launch a content council Last but certainly not least, the moment your company goes into beta testing, it would be wise to create a content council to address any areas of sensitivity that may come up on your platform. In the same way that startups have advisory boards, consider forming a content council with industry experts in diversity, equity and inclusion, disabilities, global affairs, politics, LGBTQIA advocacy, race, healthcare and social justice, just to name a few. This takes the pressure off of the internal employees to know how to tackle tough topics on the platform. It also provides the company with someone who is engaged with the business internally. These experts could be helpful if the platform faces any controversy around hot-button topics. As the social-audio space continues to expand, so will the ways creators and audiences engage with the platforms. But whether that growth continues to spike through the rest of 2021, one thing is for sure, the social-audio space may be bigger than what it’s currently portraying itself to be, and as a content creator and end user, I can’t wait to see what opportunities will open up in this space.",2021-10-24 14:07:25,,,techcrunch,True,"[('Adonica Shaw Contributor Share', 'PERSON'), ('Twitter Adonica Shaw', 'PERSON'), ('Wingwomen', 'GPE'), ('10', 'CARDINAL'), ('Clubhouse, Beams, Pludo', 'ORG'), ('Racket', 'GPE'), ('the last year', 'DATE'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('YouTube', 'PRODUCT'), ('Twitter', 'PERSON'), ('five', 'CARDINAL'), ('last year', 'DATE'), ('Braille', 'GPE'), ('the first year', 'DATE'), ('Spotify', 'GPE'), ('Netflix', 'GPE'), ('Hulu', 'GPE'), ('Amazon', 'ORG'), ('ABC', 'ORG'), ('NBC', 'ORG'), ('CBS', 'ORG'), ('BBC', 'ORG'), ('8 o’clock tonight', 'TIME'), ('ABC', 'ORG'), ('Netflix', 'GPE'), ('the lineup weeks', 'DATE'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('LGBTQIA', 'ORG'), ('2021', 'DATE'), ('one', 'CARDINAL')]"

The engineering daring that led to the first Chinese personal computer Now, I turn to the question of Chinese character output—monitors, printers, and related peripherals—where still more challenges confronted engineers seeking to render Western-manufactured personal computers and computer peripherals compatible with Chinese character text. While we call them “peripherals,” suggesting a sort of supporting role, they are in fact at the very center of computing in Chinese, from the extreme limitations that Chinese computing faced in the 1970s and 80s to the immense strides and successes it has experienced from the 1990s onward. During the early rise of consumer PCs in the 1980s, no Western-manufactured personal computer, printer, monitor, operating system, or other peripheral was capable of handling Chinese character input or output—not “out of the box,” at least. To the contrary, all of these devices exhibited the same kind of English-language and Latin alphabetic bias found in, for example, the early history of telegraphic codes and mechanical typewriters, as I’ve explored in my other research. During the 1980s, what ensued in China and the Chinese-speaking world was a period of intense hacking and modding. Element by element, engineers in China and elsewhere rendered Western-manufactured computing hardware and software compatible with Chinese. It was a messy, decentralized, and often brilliant period of experimentation and innovation. When we turn our attention to this broader ecology of computing—on printers, monitors, and all of the other “stuff” needed to make computing work—part two of this series on Chinese computing spotlights two conclusions. First, the dominance of alphabet-based computing—“alphabetic order,” as I call it—went far beyond the question of keyboards and computer memory. Like the typewriter before them, computing devices, languages, and protocols were by and large invented first in English-language contexts, and only later “extended” to other languages and to writing systems other than the Latin alphabet. To achieve even basic functionality, Chinese engineers needed to constantly push against the boundaries of off-the-shelf computing peripherals, hardware, and software. Second, I’ll dismantle the oversimplified idea of Chinese “copycatting” and “piracy” that has dominated, then as now, Western accounts of Chinese computing during this pivotal period in the late 1970s and 1980s. When encountering programs such as “Chinese DOS,” the knee-jerk reaction in the Western world has been to treat them as just more “Chinese knock-offs.” What this simplistic narrative fails to understand is that without the kinds of “forgeries” we will examine in this article, none of these Western-designed software suites would have worked at all in the context of Chinese character computing. Dot-matrix printing and the metallurgical depths of alphabetic order The first peripheral we need to examine is the printer—specifically, dot-matrix printers. From the standpoint of Chinese computing, the politics of dot-matrix printing began with the then-dominant configurations of industry standard printer heads—the 9-pin printer heads found in practically all mass-manufactured dot-matrix printers during the 1970s. These commercial dot-matrix printers were able to produce low-resolution Latin alphabet bitmaps with just one pass of the printer head. This was not by accident, of course. Rather, the choice of nine pins was “tuned” to the needs of low-resolution Latin alphabetic printing. The same printer heads, however, were incapable of printing low-resolution Chinese character bitmaps in anything less than two full passes of the printer head. Two-pass printing dramatically increased the time needed to print Chinese as compared to English and also introduced graphical inaccuracies, whether due to inconsistencies in the advancement of the platen, uneven ink registration, paper jams, or otherwise. Aesthetically, two-pass printing could also result in characters with differing ink densities on their upper versus their lower halves. Worse, in the absence of any mod, all Chinese characters would be at least twice the height of English words, no matter the font size being used. This created comically distorted printouts in which English words appeared austere and economical, while Chinese characters appeared grotesquely oversized. Such print-outs also wasted large amounts of paper, with every document looking something like a large-print children’s book. An example illustration of how these printer heads work is provided in this video, courtesy of the author: document.createElement('video'); https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Mullaney_HarvardMay42021Talk_printertrick.mp4 Latin alphabet-centrism ran deeper than one might initially expect, moreover, as illustrated in the work of early Chinese computing pioneer Chan Yeh. Setting out to digitize Chinese characters and basing his system on a bitmap grid of 18-by-22, Yeh’s initial idea was an obvious one: to reduce the diameter of the pins so as to fit more of them on the printer head. As he discovered, however, the solution would not be so simple. Interface of the IPX machine, invented by Chan Yeh and the Ideographix Corporation. Image Credits: Thomas S. Mullaney East Asian Information Technology History Collection, Stanford University The Latin alphabetic bias of impact printing, he found, was encoded within the very metallurgical properties of printer components. Simply put, the metal alloys used to fabricate printer pins were themselves calibrated to 9-pin Latin alphabetic printing, such that reducing their diameters to the sizes needed for Chinese would result in pin deformation or breakage. To compensate, engineers tricked Western-built printers into fitting as many as 18 dots in roughly the same amount of vertical space as nine normally spaced dots. Their technique was ingenious and simple. Following standard, two-pass printing, an initial array of dots was laid down during the first pass of the printing head. Rather than laying down this second array of dots beneath the first, however, they tricked the printer into registering them in between the first set of nine dots, almost like the teeth of a zipper fastening together. To achieve this effect, engineers rewrote printer drivers to hack the printer’s paper advance mechanism, refining it so that it rotated at an extremely small interval (as small as 1/216th of an inch). Pin configurations weren’t the only challenge. Commercially produced dot-matrix printers were also tuned to the ASCII character encoding system, and thus unable to handle Chinese text as text. In English-language word processing, printing was not an act of transmitting a raster image to the printer. Rather, English-language text could be directly delivered via the printer driver as ASCII-encoded text, which resulted in much faster printer speeds. In order for Western-built dot-matrix printers to print Chinese characters, however, there was no way to use these printers’ “text” mode. Instead, the printers once again had to be tricked, this time in order to print Chinese characters using the graphics mode typically reserved for printing raster images. For students of the Chinese language, the irony here will be apparent: in order for Chinese characters to function on early Western-built dot-matrix printers, Chinese characters had to treated as pictures or pictographs. Pictographs were something that Westerners had long assumed Chinese characters to be, even though they are not (with few exceptions). But in the context of dot-matrix printing, “pictographs” were indeed what they had no choice but to become. Eventually, a new family of impact printers began to be released on the commercial market: 24-pin dot-matrix printers, featuring pin diameters of 0.2 mm (as compared to 0.34mm on 9-pin printers). Unsurprisingly, the leading manufacturers of these new printers were largely Japanese companies such as Panasonic, NEC, Toshiba, Okidata, and more. Given the need to print characters required by the Japanese language, Japanese engineers needed to solve similar challenges as their Chinese counterparts. Pop-up modernity: Chinese character monitors Patent document image demonstrating the conversion of Chinese characters into bitmap rasters. Image Credits: Thomas S. Mullaney East Asian Information Technology History Collection, Stanford University Yet another domain within the ecology of Chinese computing was that of mass-manufactured computer monitors. In certain respects, the politics of monitors were similar to those of printers, particularly with regards to the issue of character distortion. Unavoidably, even the lowest-resolution Chinese character bitmaps occupied upwards of twice the vertical and horizontal space of Latin alphabetic letters, making the Chinese in bilingual texts appear comically oversized (such as can be seen in this story’s featured image). Standard, Western-manufactured computer monitors could also fit a far smaller number of Chinese characters on screen than Latin letters, both in terms of line length (the number of characters per line) and depth (the number of lines per screen). Chinese language users could thus see only small portions of their texts at any one time. Then there were challenges unique to Chinese character display: the pop-up menu. Because of the inherently iterative process of Chinese input, in which users are constantly being presented with Chinese characters that fulfill the criteria provided by their keystrokes, an essential feature of Chinese computing is a “window”—whether software-based or hardware-based—that enables the user to review these Chinese character candidates. Although the pop-up menu is a ubiquitous feature of Chinese computing from the 1980s onward, this feedback technique dates back to the 1940s. In a 1947 experimental Chinese typewriter designed by Lin Yutang, there was a key component of the machine the inventor called his “Magic Eye”: in effect, the first “pop-up menu” in history, albeit a mechanical one. With the advent of personal computers, mechanical windows such as those found on the MingKwai, Sinotype, Sinowriter, or otherwise, were integrated into the computer’s main display. It became a software-governed “window” (or bar) on the screen, rather than a separate, physical device. This pop-up menu placed further constraints on the already precious real estate of the computer monitor, however. What we might term “pop-up menu design” became a critically important area of research and innovation within Chinese personal computing from its inception. Companies experimented with different menu styles, formats, and behaviors, attempting to strike a balance between the requirements of input, screen size, and the preferences of users. There were trade-offs to each option. Menus that displayed a larger number of character candidates at once increased the likelihood of more rapidly finding one’s desired graph, but came at the cost of screen space. Smaller windows, while less intrusive, required the user to scroll through “pages” of character candidates, if the user’s desired graph was not found amongst the top recommendations. As a consequence of these strict limitations, Chinese engineers and firms were constantly seeking next-generation monitors. While this was perhaps true for the global market at large—since higher resolution monitors represent something of an “inherent good” for consumers—nevertheless, the motivating reasons for this hunger for high-resolution was dramatically different for the Chinese-language market. Conclusion: No ESC Inaugural issue of the magazine “Chinese Computing”. Image Credits: Thomas S. Mullaney East Asian Information Technology History Collection, Stanford University As brilliant as each of these mods might have been, at the end of the day they remained just that: modifications. The autonomy and authority to create original systems—that is, the systems that subsequently needed to be modified—was ultimately where power was concentrated. While the practice of modding tended to lead to a wide array of systems, it often came at the expense of interoperability. Modding required constant vigilance, moreover—no one-time “set it and forget it” solution was possible. With every new computer program released on the market—and every new version of every computer program—programmers in China had to “debug” them line by line, insofar as programs themselves contained code which could set, or reset, parameters for the computer monitor, for example. For most English-language word processing programs, for example, the baseline assumption baked into such programs was a 25-by-80 character display format (zifu fangshi xianshi). Since this format was incompatible with Chinese character display, engineers had to manually change every place in the program code where this 25-by-80 format was set. They did so, tellingly enough, using standard-issue “DEBUG” software. Through accumulated experience, engineers steadily learned their way around the assembly code bowels of leading programs. Once modded, moreover, underlying operating systems and programs could always change. Shortly after the development of CCDOS and other systems, for example, IBM announced its move to a new operating system: the PS/2. “China and Chinese-language have been thrown into turmoil,” one article from 1987 wrote, noting that no existing Chinese-language systems—whether in Taiwan or on the mainland—had yet to be adapted to it. “The race is on for developers to come up with the best match for IBM’s MS/DOS platform.” From an historical perspective, modders are vulnerable to misrecognition and erasure. In their time and place, their work was often misrecognized as mere theft or piracy, rather than as necessary acts of re-engineering to render incompatible machines compatible with the Chinese language. In a January 1987 issue of PC Magazine, for example, one cartoonist lampooned Sinicized operating systems. “It Runs on MSG-DOS,” the cartoon’s caption read. As Western manufacturers slowly incorporated many of these Chinese mods into the core architectures of their systems (as well as Japanese and other non-Western ones), it is all too easy to forget that such changes were inspired by the work of engineers in China and the non-Western world. In sum, it is all too easy to retroactively imagine that the Western-built computer has always been language-agnostic, neutral, and welcoming. This critical period of computing history has gone completely unwritten, and for a very simple reason. In the United States, and the Western world more broadly, none of these mods have been understood in terms of “experimentation,” let alone “innovation.” Instead, another set of words was—and continues to be—reserved for them: “copycatting,” “mimickry,” “piracy.” As Chinese engineers reverse-engineered Western-built dot-matrix printers, enabling them to print Chinese characters; or retrofitted Western-designed operating systems to make possible the use of Chinese input method editors, all that most Western observers could see was “theft.”",2021-10-24 12:47:01,,,techcrunch,True,"[('TechCrunch', 'ORG'), ('tens of thousands', 'CARDINAL'), ('Chinese', 'NORP'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('Chinese', 'NORP'), ('Chinese', 'NORP'), ('Chinese', 'NORP'), ('Chinese', 'NORP'), ('Chinese', 'NORP'), ('the 1970s', 'DATE'), ('80s', 'DATE'), ('the 1990s', 'DATE'), ('the 1980s', 'DATE'), ('Chinese', 'NORP'), ('English', 'LANGUAGE'), ('Latin', 'NORP'), ('the 1980s', 'DATE'), ('China', 'GPE'), ('Chinese', 'NORP'), ('China', 'GPE'), ('Chinese', 'NORP'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('Chinese', 'NORP'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('First', 'ORDINAL'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('English', 'LANGUAGE'), ('Latin', 'NORP'), ('Chinese', 'NORP'), ('Second', 'ORDINAL'), ('Chinese', 'NORP'), ('Chinese', 'NORP'), ('the late 1970s', 'DATE'), ('1980s', 'DATE'), ('Chinese', 'NORP'), ('Western', 'NORP'), ('Chinese', 'NORP'), ('Chinese', 'NORP'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('Chinese', 'NORP'), ('9', 'CARDINAL'), ('the 1970s', 'DATE'), ('Latin', 'NORP'), ('nine', 'CARDINAL'), ('Latin', 'NORP'), ('Chinese', 'NORP'), ('less than two', 'CARDINAL'), ('Two', 'CARDINAL'), ('Chinese', 'NORP'), ('English', 'LANGUAGE'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('Chinese', 'NORP'), ('English', 'NORP'), ('English', 'NORP'), ('Chinese', 'NORP'), ('Latin', 'NORP'), ('Chinese', 'NORP'), ('Chan Yeh', 'PERSON'), ('Chinese', 'NORP'), ('18-by-22', 'CARDINAL'), ('Yeh', 'PERSON'), ('IPX', 'ORG'), ('Chan Yeh', 'PERSON'), ('the Ideographix Corporation', 'ORG'), ('Thomas S.

Cyberattacks to critical infrastructure threaten our safety and well-being,https://theconversation.com/cyberattacks-to-critical-infrastructure-threaten-our-safety-and-well-being-170191,,"['Jason Jaskolka', ' Assistant Professor', ' Systems and Computer Engineering', ' Carleton University']",,,"Our critical infrastructures are growing increasingly complex as the number of devices and connections in these systems continues to grow. (Shutterstock)What would happen if you could no longer use the technological systems that you rely on every day? I’m not talking about your smart phone or laptop computer, but all those systems many of us often take for granted and don’t think about. What if you could not turn on the lights or power your refrigerator? What if you could not get through to emergency services when you dial 911? What if you could not access your bank account, get safe drinking water or even flush your toilet? According to Canada’s National Strategy for Critical Infrastructure, critical infrastructure refers to the processes, systems, facilities, technologies, networks, assets and services essential to the health, safety, security or economic well-being of the public and the effective functioning of government. Disruptions to these kinds of systems, especially those caused by cyberattacks, can have devastating consequences. That’s why these systems are called critical infrastructure. A string of attacks Over the past six months, the fragility of critical infrastructure has been given plenty of attention. This has been driven by a string of notable cyberattacks on several critical infrastructure sectors. It was revealed that in late March 2021, CNA Financial Corp., one of the largest insurance companies in the United States was victim to a ransomware attack. As a result, the company faced disruptions of their systems and networks. In May 2021, a ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline halted plant operations for six days. The attack led to a fuel crisis and increased prices in the eastern U.S. MSNBC looks at the cybersecurity concerns raised by the attack on Colonial Pipeline. Weeks later, in June 2021, a ransomware attack hit JBS USA Holdings, Inc., one of the world’s largest meat producers. This attack brought about supply chain turmoil in Canada, the U.S. and Australia. Also in June 2021, the Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket Steamship Authority was victim of a ransomware attack that disrupted ferry services and caused service delays. Fragile infrastructures On Oct. 14, 2021, hot on the heels of cyberattacks targeting the financial, gas, food and transportation sectors, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency released Alert AA21-287. The alert turns attention to the fragility of yet another critical infrastructure sector. It warns of “ongoing malicious cyberactivity” targeting water and wastewater facilities. These activities include exploits of internet-connected services and outdated operating systems and software, as well as spear phishing and ransomware attacks – something we have seen a lot in recent cyberattacks. According to the alert, these cyberthreats could impact the ability of water and wastewater facilities to “provide clean, potable water to, and effectively manage the wastewater of, their communities.” Vulnerability factors The need for combating cyberthreats to critical infrastructure is well recognized. However, the infrastructure today is far from secure. This is due to a many interrelated factors that create a perfect storm of exposures. First, many of our most critical systems are extremely complex. This complexity is rapidly increasing as the number of devices and connections in these systems continues to grow. Second, many of these systems involve a mix of insecure, outdated legacy systems and new technologies. These new technologies promise features like advanced analytics and automation. However, they are sometimes connected and used in insecure ways that the original designers of the legacy systems could not have imagined. Taken together, these factors mean that these systems are too complex to be completely understood by a person, a team of people or even a computer model. This makes it very difficult to identify weak spots that if exploited — accidentally or intentionally — could lead to system failures. Analyzing real-world complexities In the Cyber Security Evaluation and Assurance (CyberSEA) Research Lab at Carleton University, we are developing solutions to address the fragility of critical infrastructure. The goal is to improve security and resilience of these important systems. The complexities of critical infrastructure can lead to unexpected or unplanned interactions among system components, known as implicit interactions. Exploitation of implicit interactions has the potential to impact the safety, security and reliability of a system and its operations. For example, implicit interactions can enable system components to interact in unintended — and often undesirable — ways. This leads to unpredictable system behaviours that can allow attackers to damage or disrupt the system and its operations. Infrastructure systems become increasingly complex as new connections and devices are added to critical infrastructure with updates in technologies. (Shutterstock) We recently conducted a cybersecurity analysis at CyberSEA on a real-world municipal wastewater treatment system, where we identified and measured characteristics of implicit interactions in the system. This was part of our ongoing research, conducted in partnership with the Critical Infrastructure Resilience Institute at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Our analysis found a significant proportion of implicit interactions present in the system, and approximately 28 per cent of these identified vulnerabilities showed signs of being ripe for attackers to exploit and cause damage or disruption in the system. A glimmer of hope Our study showed that implicit interactions exist in real-world critical infrastructure systems. Feedback from the operators of the wastewater system in our case study stated that our approaches and tools are useful for identifying potential security issues and informing mitigation efforts when designing critical systems. This may be a glimmer of hope in the fight against cyberthreats to critical infrastructure. Continued development of rigorous and practical approaches to address increasingly critical issues in designing, implementing, evaluating and assuring the safe, secure and reliable operation of these systems is needed. A more robust infrastructure will lead to fewer threats to our security and access to services, ensuring our well-being and the effective functioning of our governments and society.

The legislation proposed in Ontario Monday requires companies with more than 25 employees to develop policies that promote disconnecting from work, making it easier to create and maintain boundaries, eliminating some of the pressure to respond to every text, email, Slack notification, or Zoom invite that pops up on an employee’s smartphone. It’s a first-of-its-kind proposition in this country. France pioneered this legislation in 2016 after a study found 37 per cent of workers were using their work phones or laptops outside of business hours and that 62 per cent of workers wanted to see this regulated. It's something many struggle with – disconnecting from work. The Ford govt says worker protections are on the way that could see employees stressing less about emails when they're off the clock – dubbing it the 'right to disconnect' legislation. @CityNewsVAN #CityNewsEverywhere pic.twitter.com/Ycd64UoUC0 — Tarnjit Kaur Parmar (@Tarnjitkparmar) October 26, 2021 Policies can include expectations around response time for emails, clearly defining what working hours are, and encouraging employees to turn on out-of-office notifications when they aren’t on the clock. RELATED: ‘Right to disconnect’ bill to promote work-life balance: Ontario labour minister The idea has been touted as something that could create more equitable workplace opportunities, reduce burnout, and help companies retain workers, according to Fiona McQuarrie, retired professor of business administration at the University of the Fraser Valley. “The idea has come up because the ways that we can do work now are more wide-ranging than just coming into an office and sitting down at nine o’clock and then getting up and leaving at five o’clock,” she explains, noting the notion of work-life balance became more widely discussed decades ago with the advent of email and cell phones. “Before there were all these different ways to contact workers, to have people work outside of working hours or outside of the physical workplace, there was a much stronger disconnect between the workplace and home life. I think the idea behind the “right to disconnect” is to try to bring that back in some form, to re-establish some boundaries between work and home because of the psychological importance of that division.” Not all workers equally able to be available during off hours But while everyone may feel the pressure to be constantly available, McQuarrie notes not all people have the same demands on their time or the same technology available after hours. “If everybody is operating on the same expectation — that work ends when work hours end — it could be quite effective in making a more equitable workplace,” she explains. “If that expectation is established of people being available beyond regular work hours or even 24/7, obviously that privileges certain people who don’t have commitments outside of work like families, or elders or children to take care of or other commitments. So it would even the playing field a bit more, for sure.” Even if the expectation of off-hours availability isn’t explicit, it can easily creep in, McQuarrie says. For example, if someone replies to an email while eating dinner, then someone else sends an answer to that before they go to bed, then another colleague chimes in first thing in the morning — the overall effect is a workplace that is communicating constantly. “One thing that putting in the right to disconnect would help cut down on, is to stop those cycles of responses and information being exchanged. They kind of build on each other and end up building a culture of availability even if consciously, that was not what was intended.” RELATED: Finding right balance with remote work can reduce burnout, experts say Another thing to consider, according to McQuarrie, is that a workplace with employees who never stop working isn’t necessarily more productive. She points to one study done with consultants as an example. “Workers were more satisfied, they were more productive because they were more focused, and also because they had time to do other things. Being available 24/7 theoretically is great, but if all you’re thinking about is work eventually — that catches up with you. We need to do different things in our lives we need to have different experiences and we need a break,” she explains. “Putting in the requirement that work would be done within these hours but not outside those hours, turned out also to have really good benefits for the organization. It helped them reduce their turnover and it helped to retain employees longer.” RELATED: Working mothers feeling the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic stress, fatigue, burnout The pandemic sent swaths of office workers home, while making work even more taxing for so many working in essential services. McQuarrie says this has and will continue to transform the way we think about work as the economy recovers. “We’re going through a phase where some very fundamental assumptions about work have been challenged,” she says. “We found out that there are some jobs that you can’t do from home. We’ve also found out that if you’re working from home, and your computer is sitting on your dining room table and you can see it every minute you’re awake, that’s kind of overwhelming for some people and it’s not healthy for them.” Related Video: The federal government is considering giving federally regulated employees the right to disconnect and had a consultation earlier this year. No legislation has been proposed yet. One of the key reasons the consultation was being done was due to the pandemic. “Recent surveys have shown that workers have been adapting to this new way of working. However, many workers have reported increased issues with ‘switching off’ at the end of the workday. Expectations about being able to disconnect at the end of the day are more important than ever. This is due to the fact more and more Canadians are making their home their workplace,” a backgrounder on the issue reads. For McQuarrrie, improving working conditions for people in low-paid jobs is paramount. “There are more fundamental issues that need to be addressed in labour legislation like more paid sick leave,” she says, noting Ontario has not committed to giving workers time off, or raised the minimum wage. “Something like the right to disconnect in labour legislation, it certainly could be a very positive thing, but if people are still being paid substandard wages and being exploited by their employers — the right to disconnect is kind of window dressing.”",2021-10-26 05:42:08,,https://vancouver.citynews.ca/wp-content/blogs.dir/sites/9/2015/06/17/iStock_000021823117Large-e1434561783140-1024x579.jpg,citynews1130,True,"[('Ontario', 'GPE'), ('European', 'NORP'), ('Ontario', 'GPE'), ('Monday', 'DATE'), ('more than 25', 'CARDINAL'), ('Slack', 'ORG'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('France', 'GPE'), ('2016', 'DATE'), ('37 per cent', 'MONEY'), ('62 per cent', 'MONEY'), ('Ford', 'ORG'), ('Kaur Parmar', 'PERSON'), ('@Tarnjitkparmar', 'GPE'), ('October 26, 2021', 'DATE'), ('working hours', 'TIME'), ('Fiona McQuarrie', 'PERSON'), ('the University of the Fraser Valley', 'ORG'), ('nine o’clock', 'TIME'), ('five o’clock', 'TIME'), ('decades ago', 'DATE'), ('working hours', 'TIME'), ('hours', 'TIME'), ('McQuarrie', 'PERSON'), ('hours', 'TIME'), ('hours', 'TIME'), ('regular work hours', 'TIME'), ('McQuarrie', 'PERSON'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('the morning', 'TIME'), ('One', 'CARDINAL'), ('McQuarrie', 'PERSON'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('these hours', 'TIME'), ('those hours', 'TIME'), ('COVID-19', 'ORG'), ('McQuarrie', 'PERSON'), ('earlier this year', 'DATE'), ('One', 'CARDINAL'), ('the end of the day', 'DATE'), ('Canadians', 'NORP'), ('McQuarrrie', 'PERSON'), ('Ontario', 'GPE')]"
15 common recycling myths debunked,https://metro.co.uk/2021/10/26/15-common-recycling-myths-debunked-15450967/,"['Lifestyle', 'Climate Change', 'Environment']",['Evelyn Richards'],,To bin or not to bin.,"Errors can mean that your environmental efforts aren’t the only things going to waste. (Picture: Getty) Metro.co.uk‘s Just1Change campaign is encouraging readers to realise the small changes they can make to help save the planet. Recycling is an effortless way to ensure that you’re reducing your waste as much as possible – as long as you do it properly. Despite hauling our wheelie bins out every week, many of us are still making critical mistakes that mean our environmental efforts aren’t the only things going to waste. Here are the most common recycling errors explained, and eco-friendly myths debunked. You need to separate your recycling Answer: It depends. The rules on organising recycling vary from council to council (Picture: Getty) Whether or not your recycling needs to be separated into plastics, metals, paper, and glass is dependent on where you live. Some refuse collection vehicles (RCVs) have separate compartments close together within the vehicle – this makes it easier for the items to be processed at recycling centres. However, some councils use RCVs that combine all the recycling into one, and then they are separated by hand at the centre. Use the government’s postcode checker to find out what the rules are for your area. You can’t recycle face masks Answer: False. Face masks can actually be recycled (Picture: Flo Rols/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty) What was once a coveted rarity now litters our streets – the surge of single-use face masks is an environmental nightmare in the making. Fortunately, you can recycle your face masks at special collection bins located in 150 Wilko stores nationwide. Wilko estimates that a huge 400,000 masks could be recycled via the scheme. This equates to a whopping 966kg of single-use plastic. Find your nearest Wilko face mask recycling bin on the Wilko website. You will also find the recycling bins at 438 Morrison’s stores nationwide The full list of participating Morrison’s stores can be found on the ReWorked website – they are the company that recycle the masks. Once full, collection bins are taken away by ReWorked, where – after a 72-hour quarantine period – masks are washed and shredded down into raw materials, which can be manufactured into new products. You can’t recycle crisp packets Answer: False. These salty snacks can be recycled (Picture: Getty) Whether you snack on salt and vinegar or prefer a prawn cocktail, you can actually recycle your empty crisp packets. Although the packets should not be put in your recycling bin at home, you can pop them in one of Walkers’ 1,600 public drop-off locations nationwide. There is a drop-off location within four miles of 80% of UK households – find your local one on the Walkers’ website.  The packets will be cleaned, shredded, and turned into small pellets which will be converted into plastic items. Any brand of crisp packets – not just Walkers – will be accepted. However, Pringles lovers will have to take their empty cans to a Bring Bank – find your nearest drop-off location on the Pringles’ website. You can recycle wrapping paper Answer: It depends. Try to avoid shiny, glittery, and brightly-coloured paper (Picture: Getty) Wrapping paper can be recycled in the UK – but it has to be a certain type of paper. While it is best to check with your local council or recycling scheme if they accept wrapping paper or not, some guidelines for checking if the wrapping paper you are using can be recycled are as follows: Avoid wrapping paper that is very thin as this contains very few good quality fibres and often cannot be recycledRecycle Now say that wrapping paper can only be recycled if it passes the ‘scrunch test’, which essentially means if the wrapping can be scrunched up in a paper ball (and if it stays that way) then it more than likely will be widely recyclableThe simpler your chosen paper, the better. Brown paper is one of the best, followed by plain paper colours that are not shiny. This is because simple wrapping paper that is good quality can be recycled, whereas shiny foil or glitter-decorated paper cannotAvoid wrapping paper that is heavily dyed, laminated, decorated in gold or silver patterns, coloured shapes, any type of glitter The wrapping paper packaging should also have some information on it as to whether the paper can be recycled. There are also plenty of companies that sell recyclable, or even compostable wrapping paper – including The Doodle Factory, Re-wrapped, and Paperchase. You can’t recycle pizza boxes Answer: True. Greasy cardboard cannot be recycled (Picture: Getty) Don’t put greasy pizza boxes, takeaway boxes, or other cardboard or paper covered in food into the recycling. The grease can’t be removed and it causes defects in new products made from recycled cardboard. Recycle Now says that pizza boxes should be chucked in the general bin and not in green ones. Want a low-waste pizza pie? Try making your own at home. You shouldn’t crush cans Answer: It depends. Not everyone is allowed to crush their cans (Picture: Getty) Despite the fact that crushing cans with your bare hands is oddly satisfying – you should avoid it if you want a chance of your empty drink being recycled. Sean Pettitt, the director of Purely Waste Solutions, previously explained to Metro.co.uk: ‘If you put all of your recyclables in the same bin which then goes to a materials recovery facility to be segregated, it can make it harder for a squashed can to be separated. ‘The reason for this is that it is easier for equipment to sort intact aluminium cans due to the larger surface area of the material for the eddy current separator to detect. The same applies to the steel cans for the magnet to remove this material in the process.’ But there’s a caveat – if your recycling is separated from the get-go, with cans placed in a separate bin or bag to plastic and paper, then crushing your cans is totally fine. In fact, says Sean, ‘it would be beneficial to crush the cans to save space, to get more material in a container and make transportation more efficient.’ If you’re unsure as to whether or not you can crush your can, it is safer to leave it uncrushed. You need to wash recycling Answer: True. You can contaminate the whole load by not rinsing out your recycling (Picture: Getty) Though it means extra effort on your part, washing your recycling is integral to making sure it actually gets recycled. By not washing your recycling, you run the risk of ruining everything, and diverting the whole recycling load – not just yours – to landfill. A spokesperson for North London Waste Authority previously explained to Metro.co.uk: ‘Food residue is a form of contamination because food residue left on containers cannot be reliably processed. ‘Contamination is created when the wrong materials are put into the system (e.g. nappies in the recycling bin) or when the right materials are prepared in the wrong way (e.g. food left in containers). ‘If contamination levels are too high when a recycling load arrives at the facility, it might have to be rejected.  If this is the case, then the whole load is sent to be burnt for energy or to landfill.’ Putting non-recycles in the recycling bin will contaminate everything Answer: True. If in doubt, leave it out. (Picture: Getty) Have you ever been unsure if something is recyclable, and so decide to put it in the recycling bin ‘to be safe’? Although you have the best intentions, improper recycling has consequences for the whole waste management system. Any materials put in a recycling bin which can’t be recycled are called contaminants. Not only can contaminants damage the equipment, but if a collection crew notices a contaminant in amongst the recycling, the whole contents of the container will be collected as refuse and sent for disposal rather than being recycled – meaning it ends up in landfill. If contamination isn’t noticed until large amounts are seen when the vehicle is emptied, the entire truckload may have to be sent for disposal. In March, the Local Government Association revealed that over half a million tonnes of recycling is rejected – this is mainly down to contamination. If you’re not sure if, how or where you can recycle an item, use the Recycle Now ‘What To Do With’ tool to find out. Remember: if in doubt, leave it out. You need to remove plastic tape from packaging Answer: True. The Covid-19 pandemic changed the shopping game forever, with more and more of us defaulting to buying online rather than on the high street. The result? A heck of a lot more packaging. Although cardboard boxes are fully recyclable, sticky tape is not and should be thrown away in your rubbish bin. Where possible, try to remove all loose strands of sticky tape from cardboard boxes and wrapping paper before you recycle them. Leaving the adhesive tape on your boxes could result in them becoming contaminated, and sent to a landfill rather than to a recycling centre. Broken glass can be recycled Answer: It depends. Broken glass can pose as a risk to workers (Picture: Getty) Broken glass can sometimes be recycled, but councils often won’t accept it in a kerbside bin, as it risks injuring workers. You might need to take it to a bottle bank or local recycling centre. You should check your local council’s website to find out how they recommend disposing of broken glass. It is worth noting that the following types of glass also cannot be recycled: Glass panes Toughened glass panes Mirrors Light bulbs or fluorescent tubes The above must be placed in your regular waste bin, or to Take large pieces of broken glass to your nearest Household Recycling Centre. {""@context"":""https:\/\/schema.org"",""@type"":""VideoObject"",""name"":""Metro.co.uk"",""duration"":""T3M16S"",""thumbnailUrl"":""https:\/\/i.dailymail.co.uk\/1s\/2021\/09\/22\/12\/48240903-0-image-a-10_1632310642427.jpg"",""uploadDate"":""2021-09-22T12:32:51+0100"",""description"":""Pensioners Jane and Vic Shoulders say their once 'show home' was left littered with hundreds of bags of rubbish, a collapsed ceiling, broken children's toys, hundreds of take away boxes and even two dead hamsters after claiming their nightmare tenant moved into the property in January 2020 but paid just one month's rent."",""contentUrl"":""https:\/\/videos.metro.co.uk\/video\/met\/2021\/09\/22\/288650398212833564\/480x270_MP4_288650398212833564.mp4"",""height"":270,""width"":480} To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Aerosol cans can’t be recycled Answer: False. Aerosol cans must be empty before being recycled (Picture: Getty) Aerosol cans can be recycled using your recycling bins or bags – so long as they are empty. Ensure you check that your cans of deodorant, furniture polish, air fresheners are totally empty before popping them in your recycling bin. Soft plastic can’t be recycled Answer: (Largely) False. You can recycle your shopping bags (Picture: Getty) Soft plastics are lightweight plastics that often cannot be placed in recycling bins at home. This includes plastic shopping bags, yoghurt lids, and food wrappers. Some types of soft plastic can be recycled at carrier bag collection points at the larger stores of major supermarkets such as the Co-Operative and Sainsbury’s. Larger stores of major supermarkets accept: All plastic bags, except biodegradable or compostable bagsBread bagsBreakfast cereal linersBubble wrapDelivery bagsDry cleaning bagsFrozen food bagsMagazine and newspaper wrappersMulti-pack wrappingPlastic marked as low-density polyethylene (LDPE) – resin ID code 4Toilet roll wrapping Selected stores of major supermarkets also accept: Baby, pet food, detergent and cleaning pouchesBiscuits and chocolate wrappingCheese, fish and meat wrappingCling filmCrisp and sweet bagsPlastic film lidsSalad, pasta, and rice bags Find your nearest soft plastic collection point using Recycle Now’s postcode checker. Shredded paper can’t be recycled Answer: True. Shredded paper is too small to be processed (Picture: Getty) This may seem counter-intuitive, but shredded paper cannot always be recycled. Many paper mills won’t accept it as shredded pieces are too small to be collected through the Materials Recycling Facility (MFR). London Recycles suggests disposing of shredded paper by one of the following methods: Take it to a paper bankAdd it to your home compost; No coloured or glossy paper which can contain chemicals that are harmful to plantsPlace some in the bottom of your food waste recycling bin to soak up any liquid and help prevent dripping (again no coloured or glossy paper)Throw in your rubbish bin Paper towels and tissues are recyclable Answer: False. Tissues can’t be recycled (Picture: Getty) The cardboard inner tube of kitchen rolls and boxes of tissues is widely collected as part of household recycling schemes. However, of the time, kitchen rolls and tissues aren’t suitable for recycling. This is because kitchen rolls may be contaminated with food waste, meaning that they are classed as contaminants. As mentioned before, contaminants can cause the whole recycling load to be sent to landfill. Used sheets of kitchen roll should be placed in your rubbish bin unless you council tells you otherwise. Some will allow you to put a small amount of kitchen towel in the food waste bin – check with your local authority in the first instance. Tissues can’t be recycled as they are made of very short fibres which are not high enough quality to be recycled. They will need to be disposed of in your waste bin. Lastly, recycling is a waste of time Answer: False. Recycling can help protect the world of tomorrow, today (Picture: Jeff Overs/BBC News & Current Affairs via Getty Images) Although recycling isn’t a perfect process (yet), it is far better for humans, animals, and the planet than the alternative. Recycling plays a major role in reducing the amount of waste being burned in incinerator plants or being deposited in landfills. If we didn’t recycle, then the waste materials would just decompose and produce dangerous chemicals and pollute the environment for many years to come. Also, resources such as oil and precious metals are finite, and so will one day run out. Through recycling, many of these natural resources are being conserved for future use. Additionally, recycling has a positive impact on the economy. Dumping 10,000 tons of waste in a landfill creates six jobs while recycling 10,000 tons of waste creates 36 jobs, RReuse.org claims.

Recycling is an effortless way to ensure that you’re reducing your waste as much as possible – as long as you do it properly. Despite hauling our wheelie bins out every week, many of us are still making critical mistakes that mean our environmental efforts aren’t the only things going to waste. Here are the most common recycling errors explained, and eco-friendly myths debunked. Whether or not your recycling needs to be separated into plastics, metals, paper, and glass is dependent on where you live. Some refuse collection vehicles (RCVs) have separate compartments close together within the vehicle – this makes it easier for the items to be processed at recycling centres. However, some councils use RCVs that combine all the recycling into one, and then they are separated by hand at the centre. Use the government’s postcode checker to find out what the rules are for your area. What was once a coveted rarity now litters our streets – the surge of single-use face masks is an environmental nightmare in the making. Fortunately, you can recycle your face masks at special collection bins located in 150 Wilko stores nationwide. Wilko estimates that a huge 400,000 masks could be recycled via the scheme. This equates to a whopping 966kg of single-use plastic. Find your nearest Wilko face mask recycling bin on the Wilko website . You will also find the recycling bins at 438 Morrison’s stores nationwide The full list of participating Morrison’s stores can be found on the ReWorked website – they are the company that recycle the masks. Once full, collection bins are taken away by ReWorked, where – after a 72-hour quarantine period – masks are washed and shredded down into raw materials, which can be manufactured into new products. Whether you snack on salt and vinegar or prefer a prawn cocktail, you can actually recycle your empty crisp packets. Although the packets should not be put in your recycling bin at home, you can pop them in one of Walkers’ 1,600 public drop-off locations nationwide. There is a drop-off location within four miles of 80% of UK households – find your local one on the Walkers’ website . The packets will be cleaned, shredded, and turned into small pellets which will be converted into plastic items. Any brand of crisp packets – not just Walkers – will be accepted. However, Pringles lovers will have to take their empty cans to a Bring Bank – find your nearest drop-off location on the Pringles’ website . Wrapping paper can be recycled in the UK – but it has to be a certain type of paper. While it is best to check with your local council or recycling scheme if they accept wrapping paper or not, some guidelines for checking if the wrapping paper you are using can be recycled are as follows: The wrapping paper packaging should also have some information on it as to whether the paper can be recycled. There are also plenty of companies that sell recyclable, or even compostable wrapping paper – including The Doodle Factory , Re-wrapped , and Paperchase . Don’t put greasy pizza boxes , takeaway boxes, or other cardboard or paper covered in food into the recycling. The grease can’t be removed and it causes defects in new products made from recycled cardboard. Recycle Now says that pizza boxes should be chucked in the general bin and not in green ones. Want a low-waste pizza pie? Try making your own at home . Despite the fact that crushing cans with your bare hands is oddly satisfying – you should avoid it if you want a chance of your empty drink being recycled. Sean Pettitt, the director of Purely Waste Solutions, previously explained to Metro.co.uk : ‘If you put all of your recyclables in the same bin which then goes to a materials recovery facility to be segregated, it can make it harder for a squashed can to be separated. ‘The reason for this is that it is easier for equipment to sort intact aluminium cans due to the larger surface area of the material for the eddy current separator to detect. The same applies to the steel cans for the magnet to remove this material in the process.’ But there’s a caveat – if your recycling is separated from the get-go, with cans placed in a separate bin or bag to plastic and paper, then crushing your cans is totally fine. In fact, says Sean, ‘it would be beneficial to crush the cans to save space, to get more material in a container and make transportation more efficient.’ If you’re unsure as to whether or not you can crush your can, it is safer to leave it uncrushed. Though it means extra effort on your part, washing your recycling is integral to making sure it actually gets recycled. By not washing your recycling, you run the risk of ruining everything, and diverting the whole recycling load – not just yours – to landfill. A spokesperson for North London Waste Authority previously explained to Metro.co.uk : ‘Food residue is a form of contamination because food residue left on containers cannot be reliably processed. ‘Contamination is created when the wrong materials are put into the system (e.g. nappies in the recycling bin) or when the right materials are prepared in the wrong way (e.g. food left in containers). ‘If contamination levels are too high when a recycling load arrives at the facility, it might have to be rejected.

Το YouTube του είχε στείλει μια πρώτη προειδοποίηση τον Ιούλιο, όταν κατέβασε από το κανάλι του άλλα βίντεο, με τα οποία διέσπειρε ψευδείς πληροφορίες για την πανδημία του νέου κορονοϊού – αμφισβητούσε την αξία της χειρουργικής μάσκας για την αποτροπή της μόλυνσης, ή προωθούσε την αξιοποίηση της υδροξυχλωροκίνης και της ιβερμεκτίνης, φαρμάκων που αποδείχθηκε πως δεν έχουν πρακτικά καμιά αποτελεσματικότητα στην αντιμετώπιση της COVID-19.

It became evident after two blasts shook Zimbabwe's Mazowe district late last week. The two gas explosions left eight people dead including six Chinese nationals. The police is investigating the cause of explosion.The incident happened at the mine about 50 km (30 miles) north of the capital, Harare, police said. While villagers mourned the death of a local but had no sympathy for the Chinese nationals. It was reported that villagers from around SAS Mine in Mazowe expressed joy following the death of six Chinese nationals who were managers at the site. The villagers described the late Chinese managers as 'stubborn' and very dis-respectful who ill-treated locals. The local news website reported that the local councillor Taera Tapererwa, from Mazowe South Ward 2 confirmed that the Chinese managers were quite rude to the employees. A worker at the mine reportedly told that Chinese managers had ignored warnings. Nor did they show any remorse over the death of the first victim. The second explosion took lives of six Chinese and that was when it was accepted that the situation was dangerous at the mine. Available reports suggest that there is a fear among the locals that China would take away their assets if Zimbabwe fails to return loan amount. China has done heavy investment by providing huge loans to Zimbabwe. Local newspapers have reported from time to time that Chinese companies have been ill treating local labour and not paying respectable wages. An incident was reported where local employees were shot dead by a Chinese employer at a mine when the labourers demanded their legitimate outstanding wages. There have been several incidents where Chinese company owners have not paid any heed to Zimbabwean law, the citizens' legal rights and instead discriminated against them from the onsite Chinese miners by paying them low wages of merely 35 US dollars per month. Also there have been cases where Chinese employers have assaulted local employees by forcing them to work in dangerous, inhuman, harsh, and life-threatening conditions which amount to slavery. In pandemic time too, Chinese companies have reportedly ignored Covid-19 guidelines and forced employees to stay together. In one incident, 16 employees were reportedly forced to stay in just one room. On several occasions, the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Union (ZCTU) has raised objections against the assault of local workers by Chinese employers. ZCTU has been taking up issues with Chinese companies following complaints of exploitation of local employees. In June, Chinese ceramic tiles manufacturing company Sunny Yi Feng had entered into a war of words with the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) over claims of labour rights abuse, including unsafe working and living conditions. In absence of any legal action, ZCTU had launched a social media campaign to raise awareness about the working and living conditions of the workers in the factories. The Chinese company called ZCTU's actions as ""corporate bullying"" motivated by ""hidden agenda"". Several other allegations have been levelled against Chinese companies operating in Zimbabwe. According to 2016 report by the Brookings Institution, there are at least 10,000 Chinese nationals in Zimbabwe, many of whom work in mining, telecommunications, and construction sectors. Chinese-owned companies, however, have become notorious for ill-treatment of workers. There were reports of workers' strike in a mining company against low wages in 2019. These workers also demanded safety kit as they were getting exposed to hazardous fumes.

KUCHING, Oct 26 ― A Parti Sarawak Bersatu (PSB) man has called upon the state government to provide all low-income households in rural Sarawak with free Covid-19 self-test kits.In pointing this out, PSB Mulu pro tem chairman Prof Son Radu believed that there were signs of a surge in new Covid-19 cases and deaths.“Deaths from Covid-19 have remained high, in the double digits range. Equally alarming is the number of brought-in-dead (BID) cases.“There are now field hospitals, which are typically associated with war zones, in Miri, Sibu and Kuching. The one in Kuching is sponsored by Mercy Malaysia.“Sarawak’s intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacity has hit the 80 per cent occupied level. The seldom-told part of this is the ICU beds are cramped in a very limited space.“Indeed, these are not signs that anybody should be comfortable with. My fear is that Sarawak might not be able to enter into the endemic stage at any time soon, as Malaysia is expected to enter Phase 4 (of the National Recovery Plan) by next month – the stage some are referring to as the endemic stage,” said Son, who is also PSB’s potential state election candidate for Mulu.He said it did not help when Minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Dato Sri Alexander Nanta Linggi had said recently that the state’s ruling coalition, Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS), wanted to hold the 12th state election ‘before the Covid-19 vaccines’ effectiveness waned’.“In view of these things and to ensure that Sarawakians, particularly the rural-based Sarawakians, are able to both actively and effectively practise ‘intelligent living’, I urge the Sarawak government to, on the most urgent basis, provide all those in the B40 (low-income) and the lower rung of the M40 (medium-income) households with Covid-19 self-test kits.“The number of kits provided should be enough for all members of each household to administer self-test every fortnightly, until two weeks after the 12th state election is held, at the very least,” said the PSB man.Son said the endemic stage, once officially declared, would be the stage where the government had acknowledged that ‘the Covid-19 is here to stay’.In the meantime, he also appealed to the GPS-led government to not hold the next state election before the lifting of the Emergency scheduled in February next year.“Use the remaining three months to manage this pandemic well so that the 12th state election could be safely held either in February or March next year,” he added. ― Borneo Post",2021-10-26 02:10:38,,,malaymail,True,"[('PSB', 'ORG'), ('Prof Son Radu', 'PERSON'), ('Instagram', 'ORG'), ('Telegram', 'ORG'), ('Oct 26', 'DATE'), ('PSB', 'ORG'), ('PSB', 'ORG'), ('Prof Son Radu', 'PERSON'), ('BID', 'ORG'), ('Miri', 'GPE'), ('Kuching', 'GPE'), ('Kuching', 'GPE'), ('Mercy Malaysia', 'ORG'), ('ICU', 'ORG'), ('80 per cent', 'MONEY'), ('ICU', 'ORG'), ('Sarawak', 'PERSON'), ('Malaysia', 'GPE'), ('Phase 4', 'PERSON'), ('the National Recovery Plan', 'ORG'), ('next month', 'DATE'), ('Son', 'PERSON'), ('PSB', 'ORG'), ('Domestic Trade', 'ORG'), ('Dato Sri', 'PERSON'), ('Gabungan Parti Sarawak', 'PERSON'), ('12th', 'ORDINAL'), ('Sarawakians', 'NORP'), ('Sarawakians', 'NORP'), ('B40', 'ORG'), ('M40', 'PERSON'), ('two weeks', 'DATE'), ('12th', 'ORDINAL'), ('PSB', 'ORG'), ('Son', 'PERSON'), ('February next year', 'DATE'), ('the remaining three months', 'DATE'), ('12th', 'ORDINAL'), ('February', 'DATE'), ('March next year', 'DATE'), ('Borneo Post', 'PERSON')]"
'Green Crackers' must be made popular,https://www.sentinelassam.com/editorial/green-crackers-must-be-made-popular-560457,"['Editorial,More']",['Sentinel Digital Desk'],,"The APCB (Assam Pollution Control Board) allowing bursting of only green crackers with a two-hour window period during Deepawali, Chhath puja","The APCB (Assam Pollution Control Board) allowing bursting of only green crackers with a two-hour window period during Deepawali, Chhath puja, Christmas and New Year eve and prohibiting all other types of crackers is critical to keep air pollution in check across the State. Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma's taking to the Tweeter a day after that the APCB clamped the ban suo moto without any consultation with the State Government has added to the confusion. The Chief Minister assuring that ""the entire issue is being reviewed afresh, holistically, keeping people's sentiments in mind"" has kept alive the possibility of the 'window-period extension"". The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) has defined green crackers as ""improved fireworks/firecrackers"" made with the reduction in shell size, elimination of ash usage, reduced usage of raw materials — which reduces the emission of particulate matter (PM) by a minimum range from 30 % to 20% reduction in PM and the rest 10% in gaseous emission when compared with the conventional composition for a given category of crackers/fireworks. The APCB prohibition is a compliance of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) order, imposing a total ban on crackers during COVID-19 pandemic in all cities and towns where the air quality falls under the ""poor and above category""; and allowing the sale and use of only green crackers in cities and towns with ""moderate"" air quality. The Supreme Court also refused to interfere with the NGT order and directed all district magistrates to ensure that prohibited firecrackers are not sold and compensation is recovered from violators. Air Quality Index of Guwahati, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on Monday was found to be in the ""moderate"" category (AQI value between 101-200) which led to APCB allowing sale and use of green crackers for two hours in the capital city on the festival days. Improving air quality has gained more prominence following outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. While air quality of moderate category causes breathing or health related discomfort among elderly, children, pregnant women, people with asthma or other lung and respiratory diseases and heart diseases, prolonged exposure to ""poor"" category air can cause breathing discomfort in healthy people too. The Indian-firecracker industry produces an estimated Rs 3,000 crore worth of firecrackers, but production declined to Rs 1,500 crore last year due to the ban. Sivakasi in Tamil Nadu accounts for around 90% of the production and over 1000 manufacturers employ about three lakh workers and provide indirect employment to about five lakh people. Ensuring the SC ban on the use of toxic chemicals in the manufacturing of firecrackers has remained a cause of worry; and, this leaves room for speculation if the firecrackers manufactured in Sivakasi are actually green. The SC also observed that during an investigation, the CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) found that six manufactures of Tamil Nadu used barium and barium salts in violation of the apex Court's order.Smuggling and sale of unsafe, cheap, polluting, and harmful Chinese crackers into India has become a headache for the Customs authorities. According to an estimate by the Indian firecracker industry, such illegal and unsafe Chinese crackers account for about 40% of total firecrackers sold in India. If the authorities fail to prevent illegal import of Chinese firecrackers which found way to markets in different cities and towns then enforcement of green crackers cannot be expected to produce the desired objective of reducing air pollution.

For over 130 years, Assam's firecracker manufacturing hub in Barpeta has been traditionally producing green crackers which emit less pollution and makes low decibel sound to make it a real celebration of the festival of lights (Deepavali) in the true sense of the term and not reduce the festival to a celebration of polluting high decibel sound and choking gases. For the traditional firecrackers industry of the State to capture a bigger market taking advantage of the NGT ban and the SC directives, laboratory certification and labelling that the firecrackers manufactured in Barpeta are ""Green"" as defined by the CSIR-NEERI is important.

Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma's taking to the Tweeter a day after that the APCB clamped the ban suo moto without any consultation with the State Government has added to the confusion. The Chief Minister assuring that ""the entire issue is being reviewed afresh, holistically, keeping people's sentiments in mind"" has kept alive the possibility of the 'window-period extension"". The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) has defined green crackers as ""improved fireworks/firecrackers"" made with the reduction in shell size, elimination of ash usage, reduced usage of raw materials — which reduces the emission of particulate matter (PM) by a minimum range from 30 % to 20% reduction in PM and the rest 10% in gaseous emission when compared with the conventional composition for a given category of crackers/fireworks. The APCB prohibition is a compliance of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) order, imposing a total ban on crackers during COVID-19 pandemic in all cities and towns where the air quality falls under the ""poor and above category""; and allowing the sale and use of only green crackers in cities and towns with ""moderate"" air quality. The Supreme Court also refused to interfere with the NGT order and directed all district magistrates to ensure that prohibited firecrackers are not sold and compensation is recovered from violators. Air Quality Index of Guwahati, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on Monday was found to be in the ""moderate"" category (AQI value between 101-200) which led to APCB allowing sale and use of green crackers for two hours in the capital city on the festival days. Improving air quality has gained more prominence following outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. While air quality of moderate category causes breathing or health related discomfort among elderly, children, pregnant women, people with asthma or other lung and respiratory diseases and heart diseases, prolonged exposure to ""poor"" category air can cause breathing discomfort in healthy people too.

Children could start being vaccinated by early November,https://www.wcpo.com/news/national/fda-to-review-covid-19-vaccine-data-for-children-tuesday,,,,The FDA vaccine advisory committee is meeting Tuesday to review the effectiveness of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine in children ages five to 11.,"The Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) vaccine advisory committee is meeting Tuesday to review the effectiveness of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine in 5 to 11-year-olds.“I think the public needs to recognize that is just a first step of several that need to be undertaken before providers will actually be able to administer vaccines to this population,” said Mitch Rothholz from the American Pharmacists Association. Rothholz says after Tuesday’s meeting, the Centers for Disease Control's vaccine committee will meet on Nov. 2 and Nov. 3 before its director makes a final recommendation. “When the FDA starts its process and does its EUA authorization, the flow of supply to jurisdictions will start, but it won’t be available to providers until the final recommendation comes out of the CDC,” said Rothholz.If everything goes smoothly, Rothholz said 5 to 11-year-olds could start getting vaccinated the first weekend in November.“Access points will be there. The limitation is, is again, it’s a new vaccine supply. Getting it, it will be phased in, not at the extent that it was, a year ago where we really had a supply limitation that’s not to be expected but it’s going to take two, three weeks for it to get throughout the system,” said Rothholz.The vaccine will be available at pediatrician offices, local pharmacies and through state and local governments.There are some important differences between the vaccine adults received versus the one younger kids could get.“Whether it’s the original vaccine or the booster dose now or the first doses for kids the amounts we’re giving are really tailored to what people’s bodies need so they get a nice vigorous response and then when they see the virus they’re ready for it,” said Dr. Aaron Milstone, an infectious disease specialist with Johns Hopkins Children’s Center. Milstone said the dose for kids is about a third of what adults receive. That’s because kids' immune systems tend to respond more aggressively than adults so they don’t need as much. ""I continue to see people who are having kids come home from school and daycare and spreading it to their families and their parents. So COVID is not gone and we will continue to rely on vaccinating children and adults to get us out of this pandemic,"" said Milstone. Milstone said people should reach out to their pediatrician ahead of time and ask any questions about the vaccine so they are ready when it becomes available.\",2021-10-26 01:34:27,,,wcpo,True,"[(""The Food and Drug Administration's"", 'ORG'), ('FDA', 'ORG'), ('Tuesday', 'DATE'), ('Pfizer’s COVID-19', 'PERSON'), ('5', 'CARDINAL'), ('11-year-olds', 'DATE'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('Mitch Rothholz', 'PERSON'), ('the American Pharmacists Association', 'ORG'), ('Rothholz', 'PERSON'), ('Tuesday', 'DATE'), (""the Centers for Disease Control's"", 'ORG'), ('Nov. 2 and', 'DATE'), ('Nov. 3', 'DATE'), ('FDA', 'ORG'), ('EUA', 'ORG'), ('CDC', 'ORG'), ('Rothholz', 'PERSON'), ('Rothholz', 'PERSON'), ('5', 'CARDINAL'), ('11-year-olds', 'DATE'), ('the first weekend', 'DATE'), ('November', 'DATE'), ('a year ago', 'DATE'), ('two, three weeks', 'DATE'), ('Rothholz', 'PERSON'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('Aaron Milstone', 'PERSON'), ('Johns Hopkins Children’s Center', 'ORG'), ('about a third', 'CARDINAL'), ('COVID', 'PERSON'), ('Milstone', 'ORG')]"

Utahns line up for COVID-19 booster shots,https://www.deseret.com/utah/2021/10/25/22744985/utahns-line-up-for-covid-19-booster-shots-moderna-johnson-johnson-available-pfizer,,['Lisa Riley Roche'],,,"Kelsey Wetzel, a registered nurse with Davis County Community Health, gives a COVID-19 vaccine booster shot to William Boren, Monday, Oct. 25, 2021 at the Davis Legacy Center. | Kristin Murphy, Deseret News ‘It’s extra safety,’ Kaysville woman says Retired nurse Donnagay Applonie wanted to make it clear that she and her husband, Gene, didn’t get COVID-19 booster shots Monday because they were concerned the vaccines they received in March might be losing their effectiveness against the deadly virus. “I wasn’t even worried about it,” she said, deciding the Kaysville couple should get Pfizer booster shots at the Davis County Health Department’s drive-through clinic in Farmington only after her “medical friends” suggested it would be a good idea. “I just think it’s extra safety. I’m not sure our immunity was waning or anything.” Both Donnagay and Gene Applonie, a cancer survivor who’s had heart surgery, said they’ll continue to wear masks and take other precautions after the booster shots, citing other family members hit hard by COVID-19, including a daughter-in-law who was not vaccinated and has spent weeks on oxygen. People were lined up at the drive-through clinic Monday, the first day that Moderna and Johnson & Johnson booster shots were available there in addition to Pfizer after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expanded eligibility late last Thursday. Now, coronavirus booster shots are available to many people who initially received the Moderna vaccine along with everyone who got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The CDC is also allowing anyone eligible for a booster shot to choose whichever of the three brands they prefer. “When we opened our doors we had a steady line of people for the first hour, hour and a half,” Trevor Warner, Davis County Health Department spokesman, said. The clinic, open Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays, had already administered some 13,000 Pfizer booster shots since those were approved in late September, he said. Appointments for booster shots at the Legacy Events Center are required and can be made online but Warner said they’re going fast. More than 90% of the 1,200 to 1,400 vaccine doses expected to be administered daily at the clinic are likely to be booster shots for the fully vaccinated who qualify, he said. Eligibility requirements for booster shots are based on the initial vaccine received, the two-dose Pfizer or Moderna, which use a new technology, or the single-dose Johnson & Johnson. Pfizer or Moderna booster shot requirements Received their second dose at least six months ago Are at least 65 years old OR are 18 or older AND Live in a long-term care facility OR Have a specified medical condition seen as making someone more likely to become severely ill from COVID-19, such as cancer, heart failure, stroke, diabetes, chronic kidney, liver or lung disease, obesity, pregnancy, HIV, organ transplant, smoking or substance abuse OR Work in a setting deemed high risk, such as health care, first responders, schools, correctional facilities, grocery stores, manufacturing plants, the U.S. Postal Service, homeless shelters, public transit, food and agriculture. Johnson & Johnson booster shot requirements Received their single dose at least two months ago Are 18 or older Intermountain Healthcare, the region’s largest health care provider, is offering booster shots at 74 sites throughout the state, said Lori Abeyta, a clinical specialist for Intermountain Healthcare who’s leading the COVID-19 vaccine rollout for medical clinics. “There’s tons of interest. The phones on Friday were just ringing off the hook with patients calling, wanting to get appointments to get booster shots,” Abeyta said, because “there was a lot of pent up demand for Moderna and J&J because it took longer to get those boosters approved.” Some doctors offices were able to start giving booster shots by Friday afternoon, she said, but most began on Monday. Patients are advised to contact their primary care physician about scheduling an appointment for a booster shot, which may be handled by staff or available at after-hours flu shot clinics being held in some locations. Experts say someone can safely get both a COVID-19 booster and a flu shot at the same time. If they can’t get in as soon as they’d like, or the type of vaccine they want isn’t available, Abeyta said patients are directed to the list of pharmacies, local health departments and other locations where vaccinations are available, posted on the state’s COVID-19 website, coronavirus.utah.gov, and the CDC’s vaccines.gov website. Abeyta said she hasn’t heard from doctors yet about the impact of patients being able to “mix and match” booster shots rather than sticking to the brand they initially received. A recent study suggested Pfizer and Moderna booster shots produce more benefits than Johnson and Johnson, but all increase protection against the virus. “All three brands are great products and we’d recommend patients get whichever brand is available to them,” Abeyta said. Pfizer is the most popular among doctors because the smaller vial means less potential for vaccine waste, she said, adding, “we don’t have a preference as to which one you get.” The state is beefing up its vaccine supplies to accommodate the demand for booster shots, Rich Lakin, Utah Department of Health immunization director, said. Lakin said more than 38,000 doses of Pfizer, 19,000 of Moderna and 16,500 of Johnson & Johnson have been ordered. His advice to Utahns who are anxious to get a booster shot is to be patient. “We don’t need to rush and panic,” he said, warning it may take a week or two to get an appointment as many of the first Utahns to get vaccinated scramble for booster shots. “Remember, these people are still fully vaccinated.

Biden to join ASEAN summit Trump skipped after 2017,https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/biden-join-asean-summit,,['Reuters'],,Analysts say Biden's meeting with the 10-nation bloc reflects his administration's efforts to engage allies and partners in a collective effort to push back against China,"US President Joe Biden will take part in a virtual summit with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on Tuesday, October 26, the first time in four years Washington will engage at the top level with a bloc it sees as key to its strategy of pushing back against China. The US embassy in Brunei told Reuters Biden will lead the US delegation for the ASEAN-United States summit, part of a series of ASEAN leaders’ meetings this week. The White House said Biden would discuss the “enduring” US commitment to ASEAN’s central role in regional affairs and new initiatives to strengthen the US strategic partnership with the bloc, “as we work together to end the COVID-19 pandemic, address the climate crisis, promote economic growth, and address a range of other regional challenges and opportunities.” The United States has not joined the meetings at the presidential level since Biden’s predecessor, Donald Trump, attended an ASEAN-US meeting in Manila in 2017. Analysts say Biden’s meeting with the 10-nation bloc reflects his administration’s efforts to engage allies and partners in a collective effort to push back against China. US officials, however, have not made specific mention of China in the run-up to the meeting as they work to set up a virtual summit between Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping later this year. They expect Biden to focus on collaboration on COVID-19 vaccine distribution, climate, supply chains and infrastructure. He is also expected to assure ASEAN that a recent US focus on engagement with India, Japan and Australia in the so-called Quad grouping and a deal to supply Australia with nuclear-powered submarines are not intended to supplant ASEAN’s central regional role. Edgard Kagan, senior director for East Asia at the White House National Security Council, stressed last week that Washington does not see the Quad as “an Asian NATO” and that it was not intended to compete with ASEAN. He said Washington had an interest in working with ASEAN to ensure supply-chain resilience, on climate, and to address “common challenges on maritime issues” – an apparent reference to China’s broad claims in the disputed South China Sea. “This will be Biden’s first meeting with the leaders of ASEAN as president, so he will want to assure them that Southeast Asia matters to his administration,” said Murray Hiebert, a Southeast Asia expert with Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank. Hiebert said ASEAN leaders would be anxious to hear of any US plans to step up provision of COVID-19 vaccines to the region, which has been hard hit by the pandemic, and how Washington plans to engage on trade, investment and infrastructure. Biden has given no sign of any plan to return to a regional trade framework Trump withdrew from in 2017, and an Asian diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the lack of an economic element in US regional engagement was a major gap. “The piece that is most important for the region, is the economic piece,” the diplomat said. “We’re kind of stuck in that the region says: ‘You’ve put in place a strategic sort of competitive structure with China, but this doesn’t benefit the region at all. And, meanwhile, all of us have got economic relationships growing with China.’” The ASEAN meetings will take place without Myanmar military leader Min Aung Hlaing, who overthrew a civilian government on February 1 – a rare exclusion for a grouping usually known for non-interference. Kagan called this a significant step but said more needed to be done to address the challenges Myanmar is facing. – Rappler.com",2021-10-26 00:29:47,"US President Joe Biden will take part in a virtual summit with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on Tuesday, October 26, the first time in four years Washington will engage at the top level with a bloc it sees as key to its strategy of pushing back against China. The US embassy in Brunei told Reuters Biden will lead the US delegation for the ASEAN-United States summit, part of a series of ASEAN leaders' meetings this week. The White House said Biden would discuss the ""enduring"" US commitment to ASEAN's central role in regional affairs and new initiatives to strengthen the US strategic partnership with the bloc, ""as we work together to end the COVID-19 pandemic, address the climate crisis, promote economic growth, and address a range of other regional challenges and opportunities."" The United States has not joined the meetings at the presidential level since Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, attended an ASEAN-US meeting in Manila in 2017. Analysts say Biden's meeting with the 10-nation bloc reflects his administration's efforts to engage allies and partners in a collective effort to push back against China. US officials, however, have not made specific mention of China in the run-up to the meeting as they work to set up a virtual summit between Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping later this year. They expect Biden to focus on collaboration on COVID-19 vaccine distribution, climate, supply chains and infrastructure.

CREDIT: Edgardo Ayala/IPSBy Emilio GodoyMEXICO CITY, Oct 25 2021 (IPS) Latin America and the Caribbean are heading to a new climate summit with a menu of insufficient measures to address the effects of the crisis, in the midst of the impact of the covid-19 pandemic. The world’s most unequal region, which is the hardest hit by the effects of climate change and highly vulnerable to the impacts of the climate crisis, has yet to engage in the fight against this emergency head-on, according to analysts and studies. Tania Miranda, director of Policy and Stakeholder Engagement in the Environment and Climate Change Programme of the U.S.-based non-governmental Institute of the Americas, said Latin America’s high climate ambitions have not been supported by the measures necessary to reduce emissions. “Goals are aspirational. If they are not backed up with policies and financing, they remain empty promises. There is a need for financing and the implementation of strategies and public policies that will lead them to fulfill their commitments. Billions of dollars are needed,” the researcher told IPS from San Diego, California, where the Institute is based. Miranda is the author of the report “Nationally Determined Contributions Across the Americas. A Comparative Hemispheric Analysis,” which evaluates the climate targets of 16 countries, including the United States and Canada. In her study, she analyses pollutant emission reduction targets, plans for adaptation to the climate crisis, dependence on external financing, long-term carbon neutrality commitments and the state of pollution abatement. Climate policies will be the focus of the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which will take place Oct. 31 to Nov. 12 in Glasgow, Scotland in the north of the United Kingdom, after being postponed in that same month in 2020 due to the pandemic. COP26 will address rules for carbon markets, at least 100 billion dollars annually in climate finance, the gaps between nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and the necessary reductions, strategies for carbon neutrality by 2050, adaptation plans, and the local communities and indigenous peoples platform. A parallel alternative summit will also be held, bringing together social movements from around the world, advocating an early phase-out of fossil fuels, rejecting so-called “false solutions” such as carbon markets, and calling for a just energy transition and reparations for damage and redistribution of funds to indigenous communities and countries of the global South. The Glasgow conference is considered the most important climate summit, due to the need to accelerate action in the face of alarming data on global warming since the adoption of the Paris Agreement at COP21, held in December 2015 in the French capital.

Public transport is beginning to electrify in Latin America’s cities as a way to contain CO2 emissions, but plans have been delayed and cut back due to the covid pandemic. CREDIT: Inés Acosta/IPS Since then, 192 signatories to the binding treaty have submitted their first NDCs. But just 13 countries worldwide sent their new climate contributions in 2020 to the UNFCCC Secretariat based in Bonn, despite calls from its secretary, Patricia Espinosa of Mexico, for all parties to the treaty to do so that year. Of these, only four from this region – Argentina, Grenada, Mexico and Suriname – submitted the second updated version of their contributions. Although they are voluntary commitments, the NDCs are a core part of the Paris Agreement, based on the goal of curbing the temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, considered the minimum and indispensable target to avoid irreversible climate disasters and, consequently, human catastrophes. In the NDCs, nations must set their goals for 2030 and 2050 to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions responsible for global warming, taking a specific year as a baseline, outline the way they will achieve these goals, establish the peak year of their emissions and when they would achieve net zero emissions, i.e. absorb as many gases as they release into the atmosphere. In addition, to contain the spread of the coronavirus and its impacts, the region has taken emergency economic decisions, such as providing support for companies of all sizes, as well as for vulnerable workers. But these post-pandemic recovery packages lack green components, such as commitments to sustainable and cleaner production. A street in Mexico City shows reduced traffic due to covid restrictions. Automotive transport is one of the largest generators of polluting emissions in Latin America and the Caribbean. But the transition to a cleaner vehicle fleet, with the increase in the number of electric vehicles and other alternatives, is moving very slowly. CREDIT: Emilio Godoy/IPS Shared irresponsibilities While some countries, such as Argentina and Chile, improved their pledges, others like Brazil and Mexico scaled down or kept their pledges unchanged. The measures of Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Colombia are in code red, as they are highly insufficient to contain global warming, according to the Climate Action Tracker. In the case of the first three, the largest Latin American economies, the governments are prioritising the financing of increased fossil fuel exploitation, which would result in a rise in emissions in 2030, the Tracker highlights. Chile’s and Peru’s measures are classified as insufficient and Costa Rica’s as almost sufficient. That Central American nation, Colombia and Peru are on track to meet their commitments by 2030 and 2050, the Tracker notes. In the case of Argentina, Chile and Ecuador, they would need additional measures to achieve their goals. At the other extreme are Brazil and Mexico, the biggest regional polluters, which have strayed from the medium- and long-term path. Enrique Maurtúa, senior climate policy advisor for the non-governmental Environment and Natural Resources Foundation (FARN), said that Argentina is an example of the countries in the region that are caught between these contradictions. “Argentina follows the line of what is happening in several countries in the region. In terms of commitments, it does its homework, what it is supposed to do, it is preparing a long-term strategy. But those commitments are not in line with what Argentina is doing behind closed doors,” the expert told IPS from Buenos Aires, where the Foundation is based. As part of this approach, the Argentine Congress is debating a draft Hydrocarbon Investment Promotion Regime to provide fiscal stability to the sector for the next 20 years. In addition, the government weakened the carbon tax, which averages a 10 dollar charge, through exemptions and the exclusion of gas, and is preparing a sustainable mobility strategy that dispenses with hydrogen. Mexico is following a similar path, as the government favours support for the state-owned oil company Pemex and the government’s electric utility Comisión Federal de Electricidad, is building a refinery in the state of Tabasco, on the southeastern coast of the country, and has stalled actions aimed at an energy transition. On Dec. 29, 2020, Mexico released its updated NDC, without increasing the emissions reduction target, to the disappointment of environmental organisations, and in contravention of the Paris Agreement and its own climate change law. But on Oct. 1 it was reported that a federal court annulled the update, considering that there was an illegal reduction in the mitigation goals, so the 2016 measures remain in force until the government improves on them. Isabel Bustamante, a member of the Fridays for Future Mexico movement who will attend COP26, questioned Mexico’s climate stance. “It does not take a solid stance. We need declarations of climate emergency throughout the country and to make resources more readily available. We are concerned about the focus on more fossil fuel production,” she told IPS from the southeastern city of Mérida. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador is facing pressure from the environmental sector, but does not seem adept at changing course. He is even sending mixed signals, such as his announcement on Oct. 18 that the country will raise climate targets in 2022. At most service stations in Brazil, consumers can choose between gasoline and ethanol, the price of which is attractive when it does not exceed 70 percent of that of gasoline. But users only opt for biofuel when it is economically attractive, so it does not contribute to alleviating the emission of polluting gases. CREDIT: Mario Osava/IPS The COP and the question marks it raises for the region The UNFCCC stated in September that the NDCs presented are insufficient to curb warming to 1.5 degrees C. Miranda believes COP26 could be beneficial for the region. “Expectations are very high. We need the big polluters to be present. There will be pressure for tangible results. The region knows where its needs are, it has many opportunities to use ecosystems to reduce emissions,” she said. Maurtúa, for his part, stresses that the main results will depend on the concrete financing and means of implementation of the Paris Agreement. “Developed countries have to make financial contributions to the transition in developing countries. Industrialised nations are asking for more ambition, but they have to provide financing,” he argued. In the expert’s opinion, “it is what the region needs. There are signs of willingness in Costa Rica, Colombia and Chile. But that is not happening in the case of Argentina or Mexico.” For young people like Bustamante, the summit needs to offer more real action and fewer empty offers. “We expect an urgent climate action agenda to emerge. We need to stop investments in fossil fuel infrastructure, which compromises our near future. We will not stop until we do,” she said. Under pressure due to the urgency of pending matters and within the constraints imposed by the pandemic, Glasgow could be a defining benchmark of a real global commitment to address the climate emergency, which is causing more and more destruction.

CREDIT: Emilio Godoy/IPS Shared irresponsibilities While some countries, such as Argentina and Chile, improved their pledges, others like Brazil and Mexico scaled down or kept their pledges unchanged. The measures of Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Colombia are in code red, as they are highly insufficient to contain global warming, according to the Climate Action Tracker. In the case of the first three, the largest Latin American economies, the governments are prioritising the financing of increased fossil fuel exploitation, which would result in a rise in emissions in 2030 , the Tracker highlights. Chile’s and Peru’s measures are classified as insufficient and Costa Rica’s as almost sufficient. That Central American nation, Colombia and Peru are on track to meet their commitments by 2030 and 2050, the Tracker notes. In the case of Argentina, Chile and Ecuador, they would need additional measures to achieve their goals. At the other extreme are Brazil and Mexico, the biggest regional polluters, which have strayed from the medium- and long-term path. Enrique Maurtúa, senior climate policy advisor for the non-governmental Environment and Natural Resources Foundation (FARN), said that Argentina is an example of the countries in the region that are caught between these contradictions. “Argentina follows the line of what is happening in several countries in the region. In terms of commitments, it does its homework, what it is supposed to do, it is preparing a long-term strategy. But those commitments are not in line with what Argentina is doing behind closed doors,” the expert told IPS from Buenos Aires, where the Foundation is based. As part of this approach, the Argentine Congress is debating a draft Hydrocarbon Investment Promotion Regime to provide fiscal stability to the sector for the next 20 years. In addition, the government weakened the carbon tax , which averages a 10 dollar charge, through exemptions and the exclusion of gas, and is preparing a sustainable mobility strategy that dispenses with hydrogen. Mexico is following a similar path, as the government favours support for the state-owned oil company Pemex and the government’s electric utility Comisión Federal de Electricidad, is building a refinery in the state of Tabasco, on the southeastern coast of the country, and has stalled actions aimed at an energy transition. On Dec. 29, 2020, Mexico released its updated NDC , without increasing the emissions reduction target, to the disappointment of environmental organisations, and in contravention of the Paris Agreement and its own climate change law. But on Oct. 1 it was reported that a federal court annulled the update, considering that there was an illegal reduction in the mitigation goals, so the 2016 measures remain in force until the government improves on them. Isabel Bustamante, a member of the Fridays for Future Mexico movement who will attend COP26, questioned Mexico’s climate stance. “It does not take a solid stance. We need declarations of climate emergency throughout the country and to make resources more readily available. We are concerned about the focus on more fossil fuel production,” she told IPS from the southeastern city of Mérida. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador is facing pressure from the environmental sector, but does not seem adept at changing course. He is even sending mixed signals, such as his announcement on Oct. 18 that the country will raise climate targets in 2022. At most service stations in Brazil, consumers can choose between gasoline and ethanol, the price of which is attractive when it does not exceed 70 percent of that of gasoline. But users only opt for biofuel when it is economically attractive, so it does not contribute to alleviating the emission of polluting gases. CREDIT: Mario Osava/IPS The COP and the question marks it raises for the region The UNFCCC stated in September that the NDCs presented are insufficient to curb warming to 1.5 degrees C. Miranda believes COP26 could be beneficial for the region. “Expectations are very high. We need the big polluters to be present. There will be pressure for tangible results. The region knows where its needs are, it has many opportunities to use ecosystems to reduce emissions,” she said. Maurtúa, for his part, stresses that the main results will depend on the concrete financing and means of implementation of the Paris Agreement. “Developed countries have to make financial contributions to the transition in developing countries. Industrialised nations are asking for more ambition, but they have to provide financing,” he argued. In the expert’s opinion, “it is what the region needs. There are signs of willingness in Costa Rica, Colombia and Chile. But that is not happening in the case of Argentina or Mexico.” For young people like Bustamante, the summit needs to offer more real action and fewer empty offers. “We expect an urgent climate action agenda to emerge. We need to stop investments in fossil fuel infrastructure, which compromises our near future. We will not stop until we do,” she said. Under pressure due to the urgency of pending matters and within the constraints imposed by the pandemic, Glasgow could be a defining benchmark of a real global commitment to address the climate emergency, which is causing more and more destruction.",,ipsnews,True,"[('El Salvador', 'GPE'), ('320,000 panels', 'QUANTITY'), ('Central America', 'LOC'), ('Edgardo Ayala', 'PERSON'), ('Oct 25 2021', 'DATE'), ('IPS', 'ORG'), ('Latin America', 'LOC'), ('Caribbean', 'LOC'), ('covid-19', 'DATE'), ('Tania Miranda', 'PERSON'), ('Policy', 'ORG'), ('the Environment and Climate Change Programme', 'ORG'), ('Institute of the Americas', 'ORG'), ('Latin America’s', 'LOC'), ('Billions of dollars', 'MONEY'), ('IPS', 'ORG'), ('San Diego', 'GPE'), ('California', 'GPE'), ('Institute', 'ORG'), ('Miranda', 'PERSON'), ('Nationally Determined Contributions Across the Americas', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Comparative Hemispheric Analysis', 'ORG'), ('16', 'CARDINAL'), ('the United States', 'GPE'), ('Canada', 'GPE'), ('the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26', 'ORG'), ('the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change', 'ORG'), ('UNFCCC', 'ORG'), ('Oct. 31 to Nov. 12', 'DATE'), ('Glasgow', 'GPE'), ('Scotland', 'GPE'), ('the United Kingdom', 'GPE'), ('that same month', 'DATE'), ('2020', 'DATE'), ('at least 100 billion dollars', 'MONEY'), ('annually', 'DATE'), ('2050', 'DATE'), ('South', 'LOC'), ('Glasgow', 'PERSON'), ('the Paris Agreement', 'EVENT'), ('December 2015', 'DATE'), ('French', 'NORP'), ('zero', 'CARDINAL'), ('Montevideo', 'PRODUCT'), ('Latin America’s', 'LOC'), ('Inés Acosta/IPS Since', 'ORG'), ('192', 'CARDINAL'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('13', 'CARDINAL'), ('2020', 'DATE'), ('UNFCCC', 'ORG'), ('Secretariat', 'LOC'), ('Bonn', 'GPE'), ('Patricia Espinosa', 'PERSON'), ('Mexico', 'GPE'), ('that year', 'DATE'), ('only four', 'CARDINAL'), ('Argentina', 'GPE'), ('Grenada', 'GPE'), ('Mexico', 'GPE'), ('second', 'ORDINAL'), ('the Paris Agreement', 'EVENT'), ('1.5 degrees Celsius', 'QUANTITY'), ('2030', 'DATE'), ('2050', 'DATE'), ('GHG', 'ORG'), ('a specific year', 'DATE'), ('zero', 'CARDINAL'), ('Mexico City', 'GPE'), ('Latin America', 'LOC'), ('Caribbean', 'LOC'), ('Emilio Godoy/', 'PERSON'), ('IPS Shared', 'ORG'), ('Argentina', 'GPE'), ('Chile', 'GPE'), ('Brazil', 'GPE'), ('Mexico', 'GPE'), ('Argentina', 'GPE'), ('Brazil', 'GPE'), ('Mexico', 'GPE'), ('Colombia', 'GPE'), ('the Climate Action Tracker', 'ORG'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('three', 'CARDINAL'), ('Latin American', 'NORP'), ('2030', 'DATE'), ('Tracker', 'ORG'), ('Chile', 'GPE'), ('Peru', 'GPE'), ('Costa Rica', 'GPE'), ('Central American', 'NORP'), ('Colombia', 'GPE'), ('Peru', 'GPE'), ('2030', 'DATE'), ('2050', 'DATE'), ('Tracker', 'ORG'), ('Argentina', 'GPE'), ('Chile', 'GPE'), ('Ecuador', 'GPE'), ('Brazil', 'GPE'), ('Mexico', 'GPE'), ('Enrique Maurtúa', 'PERSON'), ('Natural Resources Foundation', 'ORG'), ('Argentina', 'GPE'), ('Argentina', 'GPE'), ('Argentina', 'GPE'), ('IPS', 'ORG'), ('Buenos Aires', 'ORG'), ('Foundation', 'ORG'), ('the Argentine Congress', 'ORG'), ('the next 20 years', 'DATE'), ('10 dollar', 'MONEY'), ('Mexico', 'GPE'), ('Pemex', 'ORG'), ('Comisión Federal de Electricidad', 'ORG'), ('Tabasco', 'GPE'), ('Dec. 29, 2020', 'DATE'), ('Mexico', 'GPE'), ('the Paris Agreement', 'EVENT'), ('Oct. 1', 'DATE'), ('2016', 'DATE'), ('Isabel Bustamante', 'PERSON'), ('Fridays', 'DATE'), ('Future Mexico', 'ORG'), ('Mexico', 'GPE'), ('IPS', 'ORG'), ('Mérida', 'GPE'), ('Andrés Manuel López Obrador', 'PERSON'), ('Oct. 18', 'DATE'), ('2022', 'DATE'), ('Brazil', 'GPE'), ('70 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('Mario Osava', 'PERSON'), ('COP', 'ORG'), ('UNFCCC', 'ORG'), ('September', 'DATE'), ('1.5 degrees', 'QUANTITY'), ('C.

A group of state workers is suing Governor Jay Inslee, Spokane Fire Chief Brian Schaeffer, Washington State Patrol Chief John Batiste and others. The workers say their civil rights are being violated. The group includes Spokane firefighters, state troopers and other state employees. The plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order. U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Rice denied the motion Monday. In his ruling, Rice wrote that “The Supreme Court has long endorsed state and local government authority to impose compulsory vaccines… Federal courts have routinely analyzed such cases using rational basis and regularly reject cases similar to this one that challenge vaccine mandates based on free exercise of religion.” “Moreover, the State has a legitimate government interest in preventing the spread of COVID-19, as endorsed by the Ninth Circuit,” Rice wrote. He cited a case brought by a Chelan waterslide park, in which the state prevailed when requiring certain restrictions due to COVID-19.

But, Rice writes, “Plaintiffs have not provided copies of the collective bargaining agreements at issue or stated the material provisions that have allegedly been modified.” Rice also points out that the governor’s proclamation requiring vaccines “is well-supported by extensive medical evidence, recommendations by professional organizations, and aligns with other measures already in place in other governmental settings.” The judge points out that in order for him to place this pause on the governor’s mandate, a plaintiff must show that irreparable harm is likely if he doesn’t. “It is well settled that loss of employment does not constitute irreparable harm,” he writes, citing federal precedent. He also writes that the plaintiffs filed their complaint on October 6, almost two months after the vaccination requirement was announced. That, he says, shows a lack of urgency and lack of true concern about irreparable harm. “The court finds the Plaintiffs have not carried their burden to demonstrate irreparable harm absent a restraining order,” Rice says. Finally, Rice addresses the concern the plaintffs raise about public safety, as these troopers, firefighters and state workers lost their job over the mandate. Rice contends that “the balance of equities tips in favor of the Defendants and that the public interest would not be served by enjoining the proclamation.” The ruling serves only to deny a pause in the governor’s mandate; it does not mean the case is over.

She later founded a beauty brand - and faced a plethora of controversies.","Kat Von D is a controversial figure, especially in the online beauty community. Phillip Faraone/Stringer/Getty Images Kat Von D is a world-renowned tattoo artist, and the former owner of a namesake beauty brand. She was born in Mexico, started tattooing at 16, and went on to star in shows like ""LA Ink."" Von D has also feuded with internet stars, and faced major backlash throughout her career. Kat Von D was born in 1982 as Katherine Von Drachenberg. Kat Von D shared this childhood photo to Instagram on February 1, 2017. Kat Von D/Instagram Sylvia Galeano and René Drachenberg welcomed Kat Von D into the world on March 8, 1982. She was born in Montemorelos, a city in the state of Nuevo León, Mexico. In an essay for Popsugar in 2016, Von D explained that her family had moved to the area so that her father could work as a missionary doctor.She added that their home ""didn't have electricity or running water for a long time,"" and that she was bathed in a plastic bucket as a child. Von D also described some of her earliest memories as ""running around barefoot on the packed dirt,"" which served as her home's floor. By 1988, when Von D was 6 years old, her family had immigrated to Loma Linda, California, alongside other members of the Seventh-Day-Adventist faith, according to Von D's essay. She started using makeup as a teenager to help express herself. Kat Von D's earliest makeup looks were inspired by punk-rock music. Evan Agostini/Getty Images Speaking to Dazed Digital in 2019, Von D said she originally ""fell in love with the theatrics and drama of makeup,"" and used beauty products as an ""outward expression of whatever it was that was going on inside.""""I was inspired by music, music, music!"" she told the publication. ""I remember once I discovered punk-rock music, it wasn't necessarily a style that I was emulating, but I subscribed more to the feeling of being free. The honesty that comes from 'not giving a f---.' That's what really shaped my style."" She then began tattooing at the age of 14, and dropped out of high school to pursue her passion. Kat Von D has been tattooing for most of her life. Michael Buckner/Getty Images As previously reported by Glamour UK, Von D gave her first tattoo — a small Misfits skull — to a friend at the age of 14. At the time, she used a DIY tattoo gun made from a guitar string and a motor that was meant for a cassette player. Two years later, 16-year-old Von D dropped out of high school and got a job at Sin City Tattoo in Los Angeles, California, according to the publication. Though Von D's parents were supportive of her art, the tattoo artist told PR.com in 2008 that they had some trouble accepting her career choice.""I think when I started getting tattoos it was really scary for them, and you know, I had a Mohawk and I was 14 when I stopped going to school,"" she said. ""My dad's a doctor and they were missionaries for the church. It was kind of scary for them, but a decade later, and a TV show later — whatever it takes to make them understand where I'm coming from."" Though the decision to leave school worried Von D's parents, the choice eventually led her to star on two seasons of ""Miami Ink."" Kat Von D spent two years working on TLC's ""Miami Ink."" Stephen Shugerman/Stringer/Getty Images ""Miami Ink"" was a reality-television show that premiered on TLC in 2005. Though Von D wasn't part of the show's original cast, she was asked to fill in for artist Daren Brass when he injured his elbow during its first season. Von D told PR.com in 2008 that she originally thought the idea of a tattoo-themed show sounded ""boring,"" though she later came around and was excited to be its first female star. That being said, Von D added that ""there was friction"" between herself and other cast members.""It didn't end up pretty, and it was time for me to go home,"" she told the publication. Von D eventually left the series in 2007. TLC gave Von D her own spin-off series called ""LA Ink."" Kat Von D attends the ""La Ink"" premiere in Los Angeles, California, on August 6, 2007. Paul Redmond/Getty Images After leaving ""Miami Ink"" in 2007, Von D began to star in her own series ""LA Ink"" that same year. In a now-archived 2008 interview with Inked Magazine, the tattoo artist said her show had ""triple the amount of viewers"" that ""Miami Ink"" did. She also described the latter program as ""monotonous and repetitive,"" which she felt was different than her spin-off.""The guys weren't willing to involve their real life in the show, whereas I promised myself, aside from my divorce, I would talk about anything,"" she told the magazine. ""People can relate to you more when you're real and show your imperfections. I'm an open book. Our show is more rock 'n' roll and honest.""She also added that she was proud of the show's editors for not including footage that showed her ""wasted.""""I never thought that I would care about that stuff, but after reading emails [from viewers], I don't want kids to think it's cool to be a wastoid,"" she told Inked Magazine. ""The first time I was on 'Miami Ink' I said I dropped out of high school at 14, after two weeks. Then I get 12-year-olds telling me they want to drop out of school and be a tattooer too. I was like, 'F---!' That is not something I promote at all."" In 2007, she set a world record for tattooing the most people in a single day. A shirt at High Voltage Tattoo on December 14, 2007. Matthew Simmons/Getty Images On December 14, 2007, she tattooed a Guinness-approved LA logo in red-and-black ink on 400 people. She charged $20 for each tattoo, with proceeds going to the Vitamin Angels nonprofit organization. Some people lined up 48 hours ahead of time for a chance to get the tattoo, and police later had to break up a crowd of more than 1,000 people, according to the World Record Academy.To make sure she tattooed as many people as possible, according to the Academy, Von D is said to have drunk minimal liquids, wore nicotine patches so that she wouldn't crave cigarettes, and only took 3-minute-long breaks.The record was later broken by Robbie Koch, who gave over 577 tattoos in a single day.  Von D has dozens of tattoos herself, which include names of loved ones, portraits, and more. Kat Von D's tattoos includes her exes' names and portraits of loved ones. Patrick McMullan/Getty Images Speaking to PR.com in 2008, Von D described tattoos as a form of expression: ""I didn't do this as an attention-seeking act of rebelling. It was more, I actually just like this and I want to get tattooed, and I want it so much that I don't care if other people treat me differently.""Von D also said that while she used to give herself tattoos, she later began collecting body art from 30 to 40 artists around the world. According to TatRing, some of her pieces include Beethoven's initials, portraits of her mom and sister, multiple flowers, and numerous nods to her exes. Her most notable tattoo is arguably the string of stars around her left eye.Luckily for Von D, she doesn't regret any of her ink.She told Inked Magazine in 2008: ""I have lots of people's names on me and it's not so much like, 'Oh, I'm gonna regret my ex-husband's name on my neck.' It's more like a time in my life that I don't regret. I don't regret my divorce either. I'll rock it forever."" She eventually had to stop taking tattoo appointments to catch up on her long list of requests. Kat Von D tattoos in front of a crowd on December 14, 2007. Matthew Simmons/Getty Images While it's unclear exactly when Von D stopped taking tattoo appointments at High Voltage Tattoo, she told Dazed Digital in 2019 that she promised herself long ago to ""work really hard"" and get to a place where she ""wouldn't have to rely on tattooing for money.""""I wanted to be able to tattoo freely and offer my craft as a gift to whomever I tattooed,"" she told the publication. ""For me, it was liberating to take the financial part of it out — but it's not something I necessarily 'promote.'""At the time of writing, the High Voltage website says Von D is one of the ""most-requested artists"" at its studio. However, ""she is no longer accepting requests for tattoos in order to catch up with the ones she has."" She entered the beauty industry in 2008 as part of a deal with Sephora. A Kat Von D display at Sephora in 2011. Vallery Jean/Getty Images According to the Los Angeles Times, Von D's brand launched as a limited-edition line on May 12, 2008. At the time, it only offered a set that included four lipsticks, two eye-shadow palettes, six eyeliners, and brushes.She appeared on Hillary Kerr's ""Second Life"" podcast in January and shared some insight into the creation of her namesake beauty brand. She said she ""had no idea"" what she was doing when Sephora first called her, but that she was a ""bit defiant"" in making sure that she and her brand didn't ""fit in"" with others at the time.""I was trying to create something that wasn't made, and we did that,"" she said. ""I remember telling them, 'Hey, I don't go to Sephora because it's f---ing boring. At that time, you would walk down the aisle and everything was the same."" Von D's brand quickly became a favorite among makeup enthusiasts and beauty influencers. Kat Von D greets fans in New York City on September 10, 2010. Douglas Healey/Stringer/Getty Images While Von D's fans were immediately fond of her brand in 2008, other beauty enthusiasts caught on a few years later. YouTubers especially helped her products rise to fame online, with influencers like Manny MUA, Tati Westbrook, and NikkieTutorials making videos about her line.The popularity was seemingly the result of Von D's unique packaging, standout shades, and innovative launches. As Cheryl Wischhover reported for Racked in 2017, the tattoo artist released one of the first long-lasting matte lipsticks through her brand.The Kat Von D label also seemingly did well in terms of sales. Kendo, the owner of the cosmetics line, described Kat Von D to Wischhover in 2017 as one of its ""top-selling brands."" And while Sephora doesn't share sales statistics, as pointed out by Racked, Von D's Studded Kiss Lipstick is said to have been the retailer's best-selling lipstick in 2015. She became an author in 2009, and has released three books to date. Kat Von D at Barnes & Noble in Kendall, Florida, on March 3, 2009.

At the height of her fame, Von D formed a friendship with controversial internet personality Jeffree Star. Jeffree Star and Kat Von D at a Sephora event in California on February 2, 2012. John Sciulli/Stringer/Getty Images Though Jeffree Star is now known as a controversial makeup mogul, he originally rose to fame on MySpace and through his music in the early 2000s. In a 2016 YouTube video, Star explained that he met Von D around that time in 2007 when he emailed her to request a series of tattoos.He also mentioned that he's featured in all three of her books, and read a passage that said: ""My dear, dear Jeffree. Thanks for being a part of this dream for me. You've added so much shiny, glittery life to not only this book, but my tattooing. So proud to call you a friend.""Star then thanked Von D for giving him ""some of the most beautiful artwork"" he's ever seen.Von D, on the other hand, had featured Star on ""LA Ink"" in 2011, and named a baby-pink lipstick ""Jeffree"" after the internet star and his signature shade. Von D and her brand faced backlash in 2013 and 2015 after it released lipsticks with controversial shade names. Kat Von D stands next to a giant lipstick display in London on October 5, 2016. Jack Taylor/Stringer/Getty Images In 2013, the Kat Von D brand released a beige lipstick named ""Celebutard."" As HuffPost reported at the time, customers — as well as mothers and organizations like Down Syndrome Uprising and All About Developmental Disabilities — expressed frustration with the name across social media.Sephora pulled the product from store shelves as a result of the backlash, and Von D reportedly wrote on Twitter: ""At the end of the day, it's just a f---ing lipstick."" She then deleted the tweet, according to HuffPost. Two years later, the Kat Von D brand released yet another lipstick with a questionable name: ""Underage Red."" People argued that the name ""suggests its wearers are either young girls trying to look sexy, or women of legal age who are trying to look like young girls,"" as Business Insider previously reported. Von D stands by the name ""Underage Red,"" and said in 2015 that she wouldn't apologize for it. An ""Underage Red"" display at Kings Cross Station in London on October 5, 2016. Jack Taylor/Stringer/Getty Images In a lengthy Facebook post shared on March 19, 2015, Von D said she could understand ""why some have found reason to be offended"" by the name ""Underage Red,"" which she took credit for creating. Still, she wanted to ""correct"" people who ""clearly misinterpreted the name itself, and the inspiration behind it.""""I clearly remember wearing a variation of this shade when I was 16 years old,"" Von D said on Facebook. ""I also remember the feeling of wanting so badly to go see a specific concert at this age, and not being able to get into the venue because I was underage. Back then, I was already deeply in love with punk-rock music, and although in the eyes of many (including my parents), it may have been inappropriate for me to be wearing lipstick. But I did.""She went on to describe ""Underage Red"" as an ""unapologetic"" color that represents ""feminine rebellion"" — not a color that inspires ""sexualization of any sort"" or promotes ""a destructive lifestyle."" She then added: ""So, NO. I refuse to sacrifice my integrity and creative freedom. NO. I will not be pulling 'Underage Red' from my collection. And NO. This is not an apology."" She announced that she'd make her cosmetics line vegan in 2016. An interactive Kat Von D booth at the 2016 Circle V vegan food and music festival. Andrew Stuart/Getty Images Though the Kat Von D brand was cruelty-free when it launched, it wasn't vegan. Von D decided in 2016 that she wanted to transition all existing products and remove those that couldn't be made with different ingredients, as Cosmetics Business reported at the time.""I wasn't vegan when I first started the brand over a decade ago,"" Von D told Dazed Digital in 2019. ""So, the more I became informed on veganism, the more I wanted to 'walk-the-walk.' I had no idea, at that time, that animal-derived ingredients were used in makeup.""""Once I learned more about what was going into formulas, I decided, along with my team's support, to transition all our non-vegan formulas to be 100% vegan,"" she continued. ""Yes, it took time, money, and effort, but all worth it to me."" That same year, her friendship with Star came to an end - creating one of the biggest feuds in the online beauty community to date. Jeffree Star and Kat Von D in their respective YouTube videos about each other. Jeffree Star/YouTube and Kat Von D/YouTube Star launched his beauty brand, Jeffree Star Cosmetics, in 2014. As Insider's Jacob Shamsian previously reported, Star originally promoted the line through his YouTube channel and with the help of Von D. Two years later in 2016, Von D publicly ended her friendship with Star via Instagram, according to Teen Vogue. Star and Von D later argued on Twitter, leading Von D to film a YouTube video — that has since been deleted and reposted by fans — where she called out Star for bullying, using veganism to sell makeup, and not paying the artist who created his brand's logo, among other claims.Star replied with a video of his own, in which he claimed Von D backed out of being an investor in Jeffree Star Cosmetics, and that he had paid the artist Von D mentioned in her video. Von D spoke out against the idea of building a wall to prevent immigration from Mexico in 2017. Kat Von D with a fan at Sephora in Mexico City, Mexico, on March 1, 2012. Victor Chavez/Stringer/Getty Images She shared a photo from her childhood on February 1, 2017, and wrote in her caption that she was born in Mexico. Von D also said the ""idea of building a wall between the US and Mexico damages us all on so many levels.""""The ridiculous/obvious financial damage it would do to our country is insignificant when compared to the underlying message it sends that one race is below another,"" she continued. ""I AM MEXICAN. I AM ARGENTINIAN. And I AM AMERICAN. We shouldn't forget we are a nation of immigrants.""Though the photo is still on her page, her caption was seemingly removed towards the end of October 2020. Representatives for Kat Von D did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment on the matter. She married Rafael Reyes, also known as Leafar Seyer, in 2018. Kat Von D shared this Instagram post on June 3, 2018. Kat Von D/Instagram The couple married legally on February 21, 2018, according to an Instagram post, and held a wedding ceremony months later on June 2, 2018.The unconventional ceremony included everything from a red wedding dress to upside-down crosses. Von D gave fans a deeper look into the reception via a YouTube video, which shows their extravagant red venue, wedding guests dressed in all black, their heartfelt vows, and more. Shortly after their wedding, Von D was met with backlash in response to an Instagram post where she said she wouldn't vaccinate her then-unborn child. Kat Von D has clarified her stance on vaccinations since 2018. Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP In a now-deleted Instagram post, Von D said she had been ""bombarded with unsolicited advice"" since becoming pregnant, as Insider previously reported. She went on to say that she'd have a natural, drug-free home birth with a midwife and doula, and that her child would be raised vegan and without vaccinations. The backlash was swift from people who argued that vaccines are important in controlling diseases, and that it would be ""irresponsible"" for a celebrity to spread the opposite message. A boycott of the Kat Von D beauty brand began as a result.In March 2020, Von D told the Los Angeles Times that despite her Instagram post, she's not an anti-vaxxer ""at all.""""When it comes to the vaccine issue, I was six months pregnant at the time, and I was still trying to figure out my birthing plan to have my son,"" Von D told the publication. ""And, at the time, I made a completely thoughtless post on my Instagram on whether or not I would vaccinate my son. And, because of it, people think I'm something that I'm not.""""But the truth is, I'm not an anti-vaxxer at all,"" she continued. ""I just made a mistake, and I was completely uninformed. It was stupid, and I really shouldn't have opened my big mouth on the subject."" The vaccine backlash led to the recirculation of claims that Von D and her husband are anti-Semitic. Leafar Seyer and Kat Von D at a Mercy For Animals event on September 15, 2018. Paul Archuleta/Getty Images In 2008, TMZ reported that Kat Von D allegedly wrote an anti-Semitic autograph to her ""Miami Ink"" costar Ami James. There were no witnesses to the message being written, according to the publication, though fellow costar Chris Garver told TMZ that Von D handed him the photo. TLC — the network that hosted Von D's reality show — investigated the matter at the time, and Von D called the autograph a ""forgery,"" according to TMZ.At the time, TLC told TMZ that Von D ""vehemently denied authoring the text"" and that a ""full investigation was immediately conducted."" It determined that ""insufficient evidence existed to conclude that she had"" written the autograph, and ""no disciplinary action was taken,"" as TLC told the publication in 2008. Representatives for the network did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.Her brand, on the other hand, released a pink lipstick called ""Selektion"" — a German word for selection used by Nazis — in 2015, and Von D compared animal slaughter to the Holocaust in a 2017 Facebook post, much to the dismay of many viewers.The TMZ article and similar examples were widely recirculated in 2019, as some people argued that criticism against Von D's stance on vaccinations was hypocritical when the same was not shared in response to claims of her being anti-Semitic.In response, Von D filmed a YouTube video in March of that year titled ""I am NOT a nazi. I am NOT anti-vaxx.""She said in the 11-minute video that an unnamed ""Miami Ink"" costar felt ""threatened"" by her popularity and strong women while she was still on the show. Von D said that at the time, this costar sabotaged her tattoo equipment, sent her inappropriate photos, touched her without her consent, and later used the anti-Semitic autograph, which Von D said was forged, in the hopes of canceling her spin-off show.As Remezcla previously reported, many viewers took issue with the video, as Von D did not mention key instances of alleged anti-Semitism — like when her former boyfriend dressed up as a Nazi while they were dating, and the swastika tattoo her husband has (which he says is not German or ""political"") on his neck. The couple welcomed a child, named Leafar Von D Reyes, in late 2018. Kat Von D shared this photo of her husband and child on December 2, 2018. Kat Von D/Instagram ""Meet our beautiful baby boy, Leafar Von D Reyes,"" Von D wrote in an Instagram post alongside a photo of her husband holding their baby next to a black carriage. ""Thank you to all our beloved friends+family, fans+followers for your patience in us announcing his long-awaited arrival!""""To be honest, my husband @prayers and I want to take the next 40 days [the 4th trimester] to focus on the baby and our amazing relationship transitioning into amazing parenthood - so, please excuse us if we're not on here as much for a little while,"" she continued. ""Just know we love you all and thank you for all the words of love+support! 🖤"" Von D created a vegan shoe line in 2019. A view of the Von D Shoes website. Von D Shoes She announced Von D Shoes in October 2019. The brand sells everything from sneakers to platform heels, all of which are made from 100% vegan materials. The venture is one of the numerous reasons why Von D decided to sell her makeup brand at the start of 2020. Kat Von D shared this Instagram post on January 16. Kat Von D/Instagram On January 16, 2020, Von D announced on Instagram that she sold her shares of Kat Von D to Kendo, a company she partnered with for 11 years. She said that while she wishes she could balance raising her child, running her shoe company, and making music with the beauty brand, she ""just can't do everything at the maximum capacity.""""This was not an easy decision, but after careful consideration, I decided I wanted the makeup line to continue to thrive and grow, and I believe Kendo is primed to do just that,"" she wrote.""In order to avoid any confusion with such a big change, Kat Von D Beauty will take a moment to rebrand itself, so you will start noticing the change from KatVonD Beauty to KvD Vegan Beauty,"" she added. She later said influencers were partially to blame for her leaving the industry. Kat Von D at a Mercy For Animals event in Los Angeles on September 23, 2017. JB Lacroix/Getty Images During an appearance on the ""Second Life"" podcast in January 2020, Von D said the beauty industry has become ""a culture thing"" filled with influencers who tell you what to buy and how to look to ""be cool.""""It kind of throws me back to how I felt when I was a kid,"" she said. ""I feel like I've stepped away from it a lot, partially on purpose, and the other part of it is, obviously, I just — after having the baby, and then I wrote an album years ago, and I was supposed to release it last summer, and then I got pregnant.""The sentiment echoes something she told Racked in 2017 ahead of a Kat Von D perfume event, which Von D did not invite influencers to.""Influencers have a lot of followers,"" she told the publication. ""I don't think half of those influencers are on-brand. We don't repost them. I don't really relate to them. I'd rather pick people with smaller follower counts that I actually admire and that are cool and that are different, you know?"" In early October 2020, Von D opened up about her experience being ""kidnapped and locked up"" at a boarding school. Kat Von D shared this Instagram video on October 5, 2020. Kat Von D/Instagram In an Instagram video, Von D described her experience at Provo Canyon School in Utah — which she called a""f---ing lockdown facility"" — as the ""most traumatic six months"" of her life.The tattoo artist said in the clip that she was 15 when she was forcefully taken out of her bedroom by two ""big dudes"" and one ""athletic-built woman.""She then added that she endured a ""completely degrading"" strip search, was forced to shave her head, and was led to believe that she had contracted HIV from her tattoo work while there. As of October 2020, Von D was seemingly enjoying life at home and preparing to release music. Kat Von D at a party for her beauty brand in Los Angeles on May 10, 2018. Vivien Killilea/Stringer/Getty Images At the time, Von D was active on Instagram, sharing photos of her home decor and videos of her young son. She was also documenting the process of creating her debut album, which she hopes her son will one day be proud of.""I've made plenty of mistakes in my short lifetime, some more public than others, and I hope my son won't be too embarrassed, and instead learn from them,"" she wrote on Instagram.""But now, as a sober, grown-ass woman, faithful wife, and dedicated mother, I just want Leafar to be able to look back at all that I've done and be proud,"" she continued. ""He may not end up liking my music, my tattoos, and even think his mom dresses funny, but I hope he at least grows up to respect and love me for who I am.""She added: ""Who knows, maybe when he gets older we can make music together, too. 🖤""  Von D covered half her arm with black ink to conceal tattoos that ""meant nothing"" to her in December of that year. Kat Von D covered some old tattoos in December 2020. Kat Von D/Instagram The artist said she originally got the tattoos when she used to drink, and added that she's now 13 years sober. She also said she previously tried to remove the tattoos with lasers, but that they were too dark and made of too many layers to do so properly.""Now my arm looks so nice and clean, and the portrait of my Father stands out even more,"" Von D wrote on Instagram. Before the end of 2020, she bought an Indiana home as an escape from California's high taxes, ""terrible policies,"" and ""tyrannical government."" Kat Von D bought a house in Indiana. Kat Von D/Instagram She first posted a photo of herself standing in front of her new, historic home, and wrote: ""It's official! Vevay, Indiana here we come!""But after some people asked what the move would mean for her gothic California mansion, Von D shared an explanation via Instagram.""Definitely not ever selling our beautiful home in LA,"" Von D wrote.""But with all that has been taking place in California with terrible policies, tyrannical government overreach, ridiculous taxing, amongst so much more corruption, we just felt the need to plant roots in a small town where there is nature, where my son can be free to play, and where we can eventually retire one day,"" she continued.Von D went on to add that she's not closing her tattoo shop or selling her home in California. Still, she said she and her family will ""eventually be spending more time in beautiful Indiana"" once she finishes remodeling the house. Von D said a ""stalker"" broke into her home in mid-February, leading her to share her thoughts on gun safety. Kat Von D shared this Instagram post in February 2021. Kat Von D/Instagram The tattoo artist started her post by saying that Instagram users ""harshly criticized"" her and left ""intense comments"" after she previously shared videos of herself and her husband ""taking a training course on gun safety."" In response to those critics, she asked: ""How would you feel if a mentally ill stalker who was convinced that they were married to you, with prior felonies broke into your home after already having trespassed onto your property before?""""Because that happened to us last night at our home in Indiana,"" Von D wrote. ""And this is not the first time an incident like this has taken place. In fact, it's the third time I have ever had to file a restraining order.""She then asked her followers to not ""shame"" her family for learning how to use guns and ""setting up safe storage"" in their home to keep firearms. She also said she doesn't believe guns should be ""taken lightly,"" or that people should be able to buy guns without proper training.Still, she noted that she's ""so tired of seeing so many celebrities virtue signal online about taking away our right to bear arms, while continuously taking on roles in movies that glorify gun violence for entertainment. Meanwhile, people are so quick to judge while listening to music that does the same.""Von D concluded her Instagram post by thanking the police force in Vevay, Indiana, and stating that she's ""excited"" to keep training. In late August, Von D released her first musical album ""Love Made Me Do it."" Kat Von D shared this post about her album to Instagram in August 2021. Kat Von D/Instagram Speaking with Yahoo Entertainment, Von D said the songs featured on the albums are ones she had written 10 years ago when she was in a ""dysfunctional relationship with another musician.""""Basically, that was the inspiration behind even writing to begin with,"" she said. ""You know, he had written an album for me and sent it to my house with like a note on it that said, these are all the things that are easier sung than said.""""And so I sat down and I listened to the album,"" she continued. ""And I was just so moved by it that I was like, what better way to respond than with writing an album? So, you know, I wasn't just going to go and dive into songwriting, like, not knowing what I'm doing.""Von D noted that she's now ""happily married"" to a different man, who she shares a son with.""I don't really think about that guy at all anymore, you know,"" she told the publication. ""But I think that that's OK because I think that music is like tattoos in the sense that they're landmarks in time."" She then announced in October that she'd be moving to Indiana permanently, and closing her California tattoo shop. Kat Von D shared this post about her home and tattoo shop in October 2021. Kat Von D/Instagram Her California shop, called High Voltage Tattoo, opened in 2007 and was featured in her TLC series ""LA Ink."" She tattooed there in its early years, but eventually stepped back to focus on her other ventures.Most recently in October, Von D said she'd be closing the California shop on December 1 so that she could later reopen it in Indiana.""I didn't think it would make sense to keep it open if I wasn't present, and aside from coming back to work on music with my band, we don't plan on returning to LA very often,"" Von D wrote.Von D also said she'd be selling her Los Angeles home, which she previously planned to keep alongside her Indiana residence. Read the original article on Insider",2021-10-25 21:15:28,"Sylvia Galeano and René Drachenberg welcomed Kat Von D into the world on March 8, 1982. She was born in Montemorelos, a city in the state of Nuevo León, Mexico. In an essay for Popsugar in 2016 , Von D explained that her family had moved to the area so that her father could work as a missionary doctor. She added that their home ""didn't have electricity or running water for a long time,"" and that she was bathed in a plastic bucket as a child. Von D also described some of her earliest memories as ""running around barefoot on the packed dirt,"" which served as her home's floor. By 1988, when Von D was 6 years old, her family had immigrated to Loma Linda, California, alongside other members of the Seventh-Day-Adventist faith, according to Von D's essay. Speaking to Dazed Digital in 2019 , Von D said she originally ""fell in love with the theatrics and drama of makeup,"" and used beauty products as an ""outward expression of whatever it was that was going on inside."" ""I was inspired by music, music, music!"" she told the publication. ""I remember once I discovered punk-rock music, it wasn't necessarily a style that I was emulating, but I subscribed more to the feeling of being free. The honesty that comes from 'not giving a f---.' That's what really shaped my style."" As previously reported by Glamour UK , Von D gave her first tattoo — a small Misfits skull — to a friend at the age of 14. At the time, she used a DIY tattoo gun made from a guitar string and a motor that was meant for a cassette player. Two years later, 16-year-old Von D dropped out of high school and got a job at Sin City Tattoo in Los Angeles, California, according to the publication. Though Von D's parents were supportive of her art, the tattoo artist told PR.com in 2008 that they had some trouble accepting her career choice. ""I think when I started getting tattoos it was really scary for them, and you know, I had a Mohawk and I was 14 when I stopped going to school,"" she said. ""My dad's a doctor and they were missionaries for the church. It was kind of scary for them, but a decade later, and a TV show later — whatever it takes to make them understand where I'm coming from."" ""Miami Ink"" was a reality-television show that premiered on TLC in 2005. Though Von D wasn't part of the show's original cast , she was asked to fill in for artist Daren Brass when he injured his elbow during its first season. Von D told PR.com in 2008 that she originally thought the idea of a tattoo-themed show sounded ""boring,"" though she later came around and was excited to be its first female star. That being said, Von D added that ""there was friction"" between herself and other cast members. ""It didn't end up pretty, and it was time for me to go home,"" she told the publication. Von D eventually left the series in 2007 . After leaving ""Miami Ink"" in 2007, Von D began to star in her own series ""LA Ink"" that same year . In a now-archived 2008 interview with Inked Magazine , the tattoo artist said her show had ""triple the amount of viewers"" that ""Miami Ink"" did. She also described the latter program as ""monotonous and repetitive,"" which she felt was different than her spin-off. ""The guys weren't willing to involve their real life in the show, whereas I promised myself, aside from my divorce, I would talk about anything,"" she told the magazine. ""People can relate to you more when you're real and show your imperfections. I'm an open book. Our show is more rock 'n' roll and honest."" She also added that she was proud of the show's editors for not including footage that showed her ""wasted."" ""I never thought that I would care about that stuff, but after reading emails [from viewers], I don't want kids to think it's cool to be a wastoid,"" she told Inked Magazine. ""The first time I was on 'Miami Ink' I said I dropped out of high school at 14, after two weeks. Then I get 12-year-olds telling me they want to drop out of school and be a tattooer too. I was like, 'F---!' That is not something I promote at all."" On December 14, 2007, she tattooed a Guinness-approved LA logo in red-and-black ink on 400 people. She charged $20 for each tattoo, with proceeds going to the Vitamin Angels nonprofit organization. Some people lined up 48 hours ahead of time for a chance to get the tattoo, and police later had to break up a crowd of more than 1,000 people, according to the World Record Academy . To make sure she tattooed as many people as possible, according to the Academy, Von D is said to have drunk minimal liquids, wore nicotine patches so that she wouldn't crave cigarettes, and only took 3-minute-long breaks. The record was later broken by Robbie Koch , who gave over 577 tattoos in a single day. Speaking to PR.com in 2008, Von D described tattoos as a form of expression: ""I didn't do this as an attention-seeking act of rebelling. It was more, I actually just like this and I want to get tattooed, and I want it so much that I don't care if other people treat me differently."" Von D also said that while she used to give herself tattoos, she later began collecting body art from 30 to 40 artists around the world. According to TatRing , some of her pieces include Beethoven's initials, portraits of her mom and sister, multiple flowers, and numerous nods to her exes. Her most notable tattoo is arguably the string of stars around her left eye. Luckily for Von D, she doesn't regret any of her ink. She told Inked Magazine in 2008: ""I have lots of people's names on me and it's not so much like, 'Oh, I'm gonna regret my ex-husband's name on my neck.' It's more like a time in my life that I don't regret. I don't regret my divorce either. I'll rock it forever."" While it's unclear exactly when Von D stopped taking tattoo appointments at High Voltage Tattoo, she told Dazed Digital in 2019 that she promised herself long ago to ""work really hard"" and get to a place where she ""wouldn't have to rely on tattooing for money."" ""I wanted to be able to tattoo freely and offer my craft as a gift to whomever I tattooed,"" she told the publication. ""For me, it was liberating to take the financial part of it out — but it's not something I necessarily 'promote.'"" At the time of writing, the High Voltage website says Von D is one of the ""most-requested artists"" at its studio. However, ""she is no longer accepting requests for tattoos in order to catch up with the ones she has."" According to the Los Angeles Times , Von D's brand launched as a limited-edition line on May 12, 2008. At the time, it only offered a set that included four lipsticks, two eye-shadow palettes, six eyeliners, and brushes. She appeared on Hillary Kerr's ""Second Life"" podcast in January and shared some insight into the creation of her namesake beauty brand. She said she ""had no idea"" what she was doing when Sephora first called her, but that she was a ""bit defiant"" in making sure that she and her brand didn't ""fit in"" with others at the time. ""I was trying to create something that wasn't made, and we did that,"" she said . ""I remember telling them, 'Hey, I don't go to Sephora because it's f---ing boring. At that time, you would walk down the aisle and everything was the same."" While Von D's fans were immediately fond of her brand in 2008, other beauty enthusiasts caught on a few years later. YouTubers especially helped her products rise to fame online, with influencers like Manny MUA , Tati Westbrook , and NikkieTutorials making videos about her line. The popularity was seemingly the result of Von D's unique packaging, standout shades, and innovative launches. As Cheryl Wischhover reported for Racked in 2017 , the tattoo artist released one of the first long-lasting matte lipsticks through her brand. The Kat Von D label also seemingly did well in terms of sales. Kendo, the owner of the cosmetics line, described Kat Von D to Wischhover in 2017 as one of its ""top-selling brands."" And while Sephora doesn't share sales statistics, as pointed out by Racked, Von D's Studded Kiss Lipstick is said to have been the retailer's best-selling lipstick in 2015 . Her first book, ""High Voltage Tattoo,"" details the start of Von D's life, her early career, and photos of her many tattoos. She then followed up with ""The Tattoo Chronicles,"" an illustrated diary about tattoos she's given, in 2010, and her 2013 collection of essays titled ""Go Big or Go Home: Taking Risks in Life, Love, and Tattooing."" Though Jeffree Star is now known as a controversial makeup mogul , he originally rose to fame on MySpace and through his music in the early 2000s. In a 2016 YouTube video , Star explained that he met Von D around that time in 2007 when he emailed her to request a series of tattoos. He also mentioned that he's featured in all three of her books, and read a passage that said: ""My dear, dear Jeffree. Thanks for being a part of this dream for me. You've added so much shiny, glittery life to not only this book, but my tattooing. So proud to call you a friend."" Star then thanked Von D for giving him ""some of the most beautiful artwork"" he's ever seen. Von D, on the other hand, had featured Star on ""LA Ink"" in 2011 , and named a baby-pink lipstick ""Jeffree"" after the internet star and his signature shade. In 2013, the Kat Von D brand released a beige lipstick named ""Celebutard."" As HuffPost reported at the time , customers — as well as mothers and organizations like Down Syndrome Uprising and All About Developmental Disabilities — expressed frustration with the name across social media. Sephora pulled the product from store shelves as a result of the backlash, and Von D reportedly wrote on Twitter: ""At the end of the day, it's just a f---ing lipstick."" She then deleted the tweet, according to HuffPost . Two years later, the Kat Von D brand released yet another lipstick with a questionable name: ""Underage Red."" People argued that the name ""suggests its wearers are either young girls trying to look sexy, or women of legal age who are trying to look like young girls,"" as Business Insider previously reported . In a lengthy Facebook post shared on March 19, 2015, Von D said she could understand ""why some have found reason to be offended"" by the name ""Underage Red,"" which she took credit for creating. Still, she wanted to ""correct"" people who ""clearly misinterpreted the name itself, and the inspiration behind it."" ""I clearly remember wearing a variation of this shade when I was 16 years old,"" Von D said on Facebook. ""I also remember the feeling of wanting so badly to go see a specific concert at this age, and not being able to get into the venue because I was underage. Back then, I was already deeply in love with punk-rock music, and although in the eyes of many (including my parents), it may have been inappropriate for me to be wearing lipstick. But I did."" She went on to describe ""Underage Red"" as an ""unapologetic"" color that represents ""feminine rebellion"" — not a color that inspires ""sexualization of any sort"" or promotes ""a destructive lifestyle."" She then added: ""So, NO. I refuse to sacrifice my integrity and creative freedom. NO. I will not be pulling 'Underage Red' from my collection. And NO. This is not an apology."" Though the Kat Von D brand was cruelty-free when it launched, it wasn't vegan. Von D decided in 2016 that she wanted to transition all existing products and remove those that couldn't be made with different ingredients, as Cosmetics Business reported at the time . ""I wasn't vegan when I first started the brand over a decade ago,"" Von D told Dazed Digital in 2019 . ""So, the more I became informed on veganism, the more I wanted to 'walk-the-walk.' I had no idea, at that time, that animal-derived ingredients were used in makeup."" ""Once I learned more about what was going into formulas, I decided, along with my team's support, to transition all our non-vegan formulas to be 100% vegan,"" she continued. ""Yes, it took time, money, and effort, but all worth it to me."" Star launched his beauty brand, Jeffree Star Cosmetics, in 2014. As Insider's Jacob Shamsian previously reported , Star originally promoted the line through his YouTube channel and with the help of Von D. Two years later in 2016, Von D publicly ended her friendship with Star via Instagram , according to Teen Vogue. Star and Von D later argued on Twitter, leading Von D to film a YouTube video — that has since been deleted and reposted by fans — where she called out Star for bullying, using veganism to sell makeup, and not paying the artist who created his brand's logo, among other claims. Star replied with a video of his own , in which he claimed Von D backed out of being an investor in Jeffree Star Cosmetics, and that he had paid the artist Von D mentioned in her video. She shared a photo from her childhood on February 1, 2017 , and wrote in her caption that she was born in Mexico. Von D also said the ""idea of building a wall between the US and Mexico damages us all on so many levels."" ""The ridiculous/obvious financial damage it would do to our country is insignificant when compared to the underlying message it sends that one race is below another,"" she continued. ""I AM MEXICAN. I AM ARGENTINIAN. And I AM AMERICAN. We shouldn't forget we are a nation of immigrants."" Though the photo is still on her page, her caption was seemingly removed towards the end of October 2020. Representatives for Kat Von D did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment on the matter. The couple married legally on February 21, 2018, according to an Instagram post , and held a wedding ceremony months later on June 2, 2018. The unconventional ceremony included everything from a red wedding dress to upside-down crosses . Von D gave fans a deeper look into the reception via a YouTube video , which shows their extravagant red venue, wedding guests dressed in all black, their heartfelt vows, and more. In a now-deleted Instagram post, Von D said she had been ""bombarded with unsolicited advice"" since becoming pregnant, as Insider previously reported . She went on to say that she'd have a natural, drug-free home birth with a midwife and doula, and that her child would be raised vegan and without vaccinations. The backlash was swift from people who argued that vaccines are important in controlling diseases, and that it would be ""irresponsible"" for a celebrity to spread the opposite message. A boycott of the Kat Von D beauty brand began as a result. In March 2020, Von D told the Los Angeles Times that despite her Instagram post, she's not an anti-vaxxer ""at all."" ""When it comes to the vaccine issue, I was six months pregnant at the time, and I was still trying to figure out my birthing plan to have my son,"" Von D told the publication . ""And, at the time, I made a completely thoughtless post on my Instagram on whether or not I would vaccinate my son. And, because of it, people think I'm something that I'm not."" ""But the truth is, I'm not an anti-vaxxer at all,"" she continued. ""I just made a mistake, and I was completely uninformed. It was stupid, and I really shouldn't have opened my big mouth on the subject."" In 2008, TMZ reported that Kat Von D allegedly wrote an anti-Semitic autograph to her ""Miami Ink"" costar Ami James. There were no witnesses to the message being written, according to the publication, though fellow costar Chris Garver told TMZ that Von D handed him the photo. TLC — the network that hosted Von D's reality show — investigated the matter at the time, and Von D called the autograph a ""forgery,"" according to TMZ. At the time, TLC told TMZ that Von D ""vehemently denied authoring the text"" and that a ""full investigation was immediately conducted."" It determined that ""insufficient evidence existed to conclude that she had"" written the autograph, and ""no disciplinary action was taken,"" as TLC told the publication in 2008. Representatives for the network did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. Her brand, on the other hand, released a pink lipstick called ""Selektion"" — a German word for selection used by Nazis — in 2015, and Von D compared animal slaughter to the Holocaust in a 2017 Facebook post, much to the dismay of many viewers. The TMZ article and similar examples were widely recirculated in 2019, as some people argued that criticism against Von D's stance on vaccinations was hypocritical when the same was not shared in response to claims of her being anti-Semitic. In response, Von D filmed a YouTube video in March of that year titled ""I am NOT a nazi. I am NOT anti-vaxx."" She said in the 11-minute video that an unnamed ""Miami Ink"" costar felt ""threatened"" by her popularity and strong women while she was still on the show. Von D said that at the time, this costar sabotaged her tattoo equipment, sent her inappropriate photos, touched her without her consent, and later used the anti-Semitic autograph, which Von D said was forged, in the hopes of canceling her spin-off show. As Remezcla previously reported , many viewers took issue with the video, as Von D did not mention key instances of alleged anti-Semitism — like when her former boyfriend dressed up as a Nazi while they were dating, and the swastika tattoo her husband has (which he says is not German or ""political"" ) on his neck. ""Meet our beautiful baby boy, Leafar Von D Reyes,"" Von D wrote in an Instagram post alongside a photo of her husband holding their baby next to a black carriage. ""Thank you to all our beloved friends+family, fans+followers for your patience in us announcing his long-awaited arrival!"" ""To be honest, my husband @prayers and I want to take the next 40 days [the 4th trimester] to focus on the baby and our amazing relationship transitioning into amazing parenthood - so, please excuse us if we're not on here as much for a little while,"" she continued. ""Just know we love you all and thank you for all the words of love+support! 🖤"" She announced Von D Shoes in October 2019. The brand sells everything from sneakers to platform heels, all of which are made from 100% vegan materials. On January 16, 2020, Von D announced on Instagram that she sold her shares of Kat Von D to Kendo , a company she partnered with for 11 years. She said that while she wishes she could balance raising her child, running her shoe company, and making music with the beauty brand, she ""just can't do everything at the maximum capacity."" ""This was not an easy decision, but after careful consideration, I decided I wanted the makeup line to continue to thrive and grow, and I believe Kendo is primed to do just that,"" she wrote. ""In order to avoid any confusion with such a big change, Kat Von D Beauty will take a moment to rebrand itself, so you will start noticing the change from KatVonD Beauty to KvD Vegan Beauty ,"" she added. During an appearance on the ""Second Life"" podcast in January 2020, Von D said the beauty industry has become ""a culture thing"" filled with influencers who tell you what to buy and how to look to ""be cool."" ""It kind of throws me back to how I felt when I was a kid,"" she said. ""I feel like I've stepped away from it a lot, partially on purpose, and the other part of it is, obviously, I just — after having the baby, and then I wrote an album years ago, and I was supposed to release it last summer, and then I got pregnant."" The sentiment echoes something she told Racked in 2017 ahead of a Kat Von D perfume event, which Von D did not invite influencers to. ""Influencers have a lot of followers,"" she told the publication. ""I don't think half of those influencers are on-brand. We don't repost them. I don't really relate to them. I'd rather pick people with smaller follower counts that I actually admire and that are cool and that are different, you know?"" In an Instagram video , Von D described her experience at Provo Canyon School in Utah — which she called a""f---ing lockdown facility"" — as the ""most traumatic six months"" of her life. The tattoo artist said in the clip that she was 15 when she was forcefully taken out of her bedroom by two ""big dudes"" and one ""athletic-built woman."" She then added that she endured a ""completely degrading"" strip search, was forced to shave her head, and was led to believe that she had contracted HIV from her tattoo work while there. At the time, Von D was active on Instagram , sharing photos of her home decor and videos of her young son . She was also documenting the process of creating her debut album, which she hopes her son will one day be proud of. ""I've made plenty of mistakes in my short lifetime, some more public than others, and I hope my son won't be too embarrassed, and instead learn from them,"" she wrote on Instagram . ""But now, as a sober, grown-ass woman, faithful wife, and dedicated mother, I just want Leafar to be able to look back at all that I've done and be proud,"" she continued. ""He may not end up liking my music, my tattoos, and even think his mom dresses funny, but I hope he at least grows up to respect and love me for who I am."" She added: ""Who knows, maybe when he gets older we can make music together, too. 🖤"" The artist said she originally got the tattoos when she used to drink, and added that she's now 13 years sober. She also said she previously tried to remove the tattoos with lasers, but that they were too dark and made of too many layers to do so properly. ""Now my arm looks so nice and clean, and the portrait of my Father stands out even more,"" Von D wrote on Instagram . She first posted a photo of herself standing in front of her new, historic home, and wrote: ""It's official! Vevay, Indiana here we come!"" But after some people asked what the move would mean for her gothic California mansion, Von D shared an explanation via Instagram. ""Definitely not ever selling our beautiful home in LA,"" Von D wrote. ""But with all that has been taking place in California with terrible policies, tyrannical government overreach, ridiculous taxing, amongst so much more corruption, we just felt the need to plant roots in a small town where there is nature, where my son can be free to play, and where we can eventually retire one day,"" she continued. Von D went on to add that she's not closing her tattoo shop or selling her home in California. Still, she said she and her family will ""eventually be spending more time in beautiful Indiana"" once she finishes remodeling the house. The tattoo artist started her post by saying that Instagram users ""harshly criticized"" her and left ""intense comments"" after she previously shared videos of herself and her husband ""taking a training course on gun safety."" In response to those critics, she asked: ""How would you feel if a mentally ill stalker who was convinced that they were married to you, with prior felonies broke into your home after already having trespassed onto your property before?"" ""Because that happened to us last night at our home in Indiana,"" Von D wrote. ""And this is not the first time an incident like this has taken place. In fact, it's the third time I have ever had to file a restraining order."" She then asked her followers to not ""shame"" her family for learning how to use guns and ""setting up safe storage"" in their home to keep firearms. She also said she doesn't believe guns should be ""taken lightly,"" or that people should be able to buy guns without proper training. Still, she noted that she's ""so tired of seeing so many celebrities virtue signal online about taking away our right to bear arms, while continuously taking on roles in movies that glorify gun violence for entertainment. Meanwhile, people are so quick to judge while listening to music that does the same."" Von D concluded her Instagram post by thanking the police force in Vevay, Indiana, and stating that she's ""excited"" to keep training. Speaking with Yahoo Entertainment, Von D said the songs featured on the albums are ones she had written 10 years ago when she was in a ""dysfunctional relationship with another musician."" ""Basically, that was the inspiration behind even writing to begin with,"" she said. ""You know, he had written an album for me and sent it to my house with like a note on it that said, these are all the things that are easier sung than said."" ""And so I sat down and I listened to the album,"" she continued. ""And I was just so moved by it that I was like, what better way to respond than with writing an album? So, you know, I wasn't just going to go and dive into songwriting, like, not knowing what I'm doing."" Von D noted that she's now ""happily married"" to a different man, who she shares a son with. ""I don't really think about that guy at all anymore, you know,"" she told the publication. ""But I think that that's OK because I think that music is like tattoos in the sense that they're landmarks in time."" Her California shop, called High Voltage Tattoo, opened in 2007 and was featured in her TLC series ""LA Ink."" She tattooed there in its early years, but eventually stepped back to focus on her other ventures. Most recently in October, Von D said she'd be closing the California shop on December 1 so that she could later reopen it in Indiana. ""I didn't think it would make sense to keep it open if I wasn't present, and aside from coming back to work on music with my band, we don't plan on returning to LA very often,"" Von D wrote. Von D also said she'd be selling her Los Angeles home, which she previously planned to keep alongside her Indiana residence.",https://i.insider.com/603ffa092dc90100183553c0?format=jpeg,insider,True,"[('Phillip Faraone/Stringer/Getty Images Kat Von', 'PERSON'), ('Mexico', 'GPE'), ('16', 'CARDINAL'), ('LA Ink',

Facebook is spending at least $10 billion this year on its metaverse division,https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745381/facebook-reality-labs-10-billion-metaverse,,['Jacob Kastrenakes'],,,"Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge Facebook plans to spend at least $10 billion this year on Facebook Reality Labs, its metaverse division tasked with creating AR and VR hardware, software, and content. “We are committed to bringing this long-term vision to life and we expect to increase our investments for the next several years,” the company writes in its third-quarter earnings release this afternoon. Facebook sees AR and VR as being core to “the next generation of online social experiences.” A sign that Reality Labs should be judged separately from Facebook’s core apps The division, which already makes the Oculus Quest headset and Portal lineup of calling devices, is clearly being positioned as the next big thing inside of Facebook. For one, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been talking about the metaverse nonstop for the past several months. And today, Facebook said it’s going to begin reporting earnings specifically for its Reality Labs segment, while Facebook’s main ads business — a staggering $28 billion this last quarter alone — will be reported under another bucket. It’s a sign to investors that the Reality Labs business matters and should be judged separately from how they value Facebook today. It’s also a move to, perhaps, distract from what else is going on in Facebook’s earnings today. The company missed revenue expectations by around $1 billion (this is not a lot, exactly, at Facebook’s scale), which speaks to some of the company’s struggles right now. Facebook blames a number of factors for this: COVID-19, the economy, and Apple’s recent ad-tracking changes — something we saw last week when Snap reported earnings, too. Apple updated iOS in April with a new privacy feature that requires users to actively opt in to allow apps to track them across other apps and websites. Initially, social media companies said they weren’t certain how much it would impact their ads businesses, which rely on that tracking in part to measure the efficacy of ads. It’s been a rough few weeks for Facebook. A series of stories in The Wall Street Journal detailed significant missteps by the company, including moderation issues and concerns about younger users’ mental health; the whistleblower who leaked those documents then testified before Congress; and just this morning, dozens of stories were published by a consortium of news outlets, including The Verge, covering even more problems for Facebook, including worries about declining usage among teens.

Bayern Munich club members move to end Qatar Airways sponsorship at general assembly,https://www.bavarianfootballworks.com/2021/10/25/22745330/bayern-munich-club-members-qatar-airways-sponsorship-annual-general-assembly-world-cup-2022,,['John Dillon'],,,"Bayern Munich board member Andreas Jung with Hamad International Airport CEO Akbar al-Baker after the club signed a new sponsorship deal, August 14, 2017. | Photo credit should read STRINGER/AFP/Getty Images Bayern’s hotly debated sponsorship by Qatar Airways will be discussed at the club’s upcoming Annual General Assembly in November. A motion initiated by Bayern Munich club member Michael Ott has gained traction and attention ahead of the club’s upcoming annual general assembly on November 25: Ott has filed a motion that would oblige Bayern to allow its sponsorship deal with Qatar Airways (2016/17-2022/23) to expire and forbid the club to conclude further sponsoring deals with companies of which a majority is owned by the Qatari Emirate. The motion, which can be found online at http://katar-antrag.de/, reads in translation as follows: May the members’ assembly resolve: FC Bayern Munich e.V. [registered club], through exercise of all necessary legal and factional avenues at its disposal, influences FC Bayern Munich AG [corporation] to the effect that sponsoring contracts with Qatar Airways or other companies majority-owned by the Emirate of Qatar are allowed to expire and not extended or not concluded de novo. [Editor: FC Bayern e.V. is the overarching club, which is majority owner of FC Bayern AG, the corporation that comprises the original soccer branch of the club. The annual general assembly includes the entire FC Bayern, from the chess team to the soccer team.] Ott sets out the justification for the measure in five detailed points. He told Bild, “We want to take preventative measures to prevent a new contract.” The principal reason is Qatar’s history of human rights violations. Ott explains, “Qatar Airways is 100% owned by the Emirate of Qatar. This country stands for massive human rights violations, and there moreover are serious charges of corruption in sports. Instead of effecting change, FC Bayern is actively helping the Emirate of Qatar with its sponsorship to draw attention away from these evils.” With such “indifference,” Ott argues, FC Bayern damages its own reputation and “falls short of its status as an exemplary model.” The motion would not, however, preclude Bayern from traveling to its annual training camp at the Aspire Academy in Doha, Qatar. Ott said that the event provides “an opportunity for critical communication, at least in theory.” I have commented several times on Bayern Munich’s relationship with Qatar Airways over the years. Bayern first visited Qatar in 2011, not long after Qatar made its controversial, and ultimately successful, bid to host World Cup 2022. Qatar’s Hamad International Airport became a “platinum sponsor” of the club in 2016, leading to the notorious Qatar Airways sleeve sponsorship in 2017. Recently, controversy over Qatar has been overshadowed by other themes, notably the Bayern leadership’s indignant response to insults leveled by its ultras at TSG Hoffenheim owner Dietmar Hopp, ensuing—arguably belated—engagement with the Black Lives Matter movement, and above all the Coronavirus pandemic. Even as the club still finds itself navigating difficult waters with respect to COVID-19 and vaccination, the subject of Qatar has not gone away. As World Cup 2022 looms on the horizon, despite the logistical nightmare a winter World Cup will create and ongoing allegations of corruption in the award process, the theme is bound to remain relevant.

Bayern star Joshua Kimmich at center of COVID vaccine debate,https://lethbridgenewsnow.com/2021/10/25/bayern-star-joshua-kimmich-at-center-of-covid-vaccine-debate/,,,,BERLIN (AP) - Bayern Munich soccer star Joshua Kimmich has found himself at the center of a debate in Germany over the merits of vaccination against t...,"BERLIN (AP) — Bayern Munich soccer star Joshua Kimmich has found himself at the center of a debate in Germany over the merits of vaccination against the coronavirus. The 26-year-old Kimmich, tipped as a future Germany captain for his leadership qualities, confirmed over the weekend that he is yet to be vaccinated against COVID-19 because of his own concerns about “a lack of long-term studies” into the effects of the vaccines. Kimmich said he was still considering it and that it was “very possible that I will get vaccinated.” His comments were welcomed by the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has consistently opposed measures against the coronavirus, while they led to dismay among those who are banking on vaccines as a route back toward normalcy at a time when infection rates are climbing again in Germany. “The more people who are vaccinated, the less dangerous the virus will be,” Leipzig’s American coach Jesse Marsch said Monday. Medical expert Alena Buyx, president of the German Ethics Council, said Kimmich is “caught up in misinformation. He is very badly advised. This is something that has now spread, and it would be great if he’d used his platform to get better advice to be a role model in this regard.” Buyx added: “It is important to clarify that these forms of long-term effects do not exist.” German government spokesman Steffen Seibert said Monday that there were “clear and convincing answers” to Kimmich’s questions from national and international experts, and that he hoped that “Kimmich lets all this information work on him and then maybe he can decide in favor of the vaccination.” Kimmich’s reluctance to get vaccinated surprised many due to his involvement in setting up the “We Kick Corona” fundraising campaign with Bayern and Germany teammate Leon Goretzka in March 2020. Together they raised millions for social and charitable organizations to continue working during the pandemic, while some of that money also went to medical associations. “We also donated to UNICEF, who made vaccines available. The point was that there are also countries that do not have access to vaccines,” Kimmich said Saturday after Bayern’s win over Hoffenheim. “I think everyone should make the decision for themselves and it cannot be that someone has no access. Because if you make the decision to do so, then you should do everything you can to ensure that they can get the vaccine.” The player denied being opposed to vaccines. “I think that’s a shame about the debate, that it’s only about being vaccinated or not vaccinated and if you’re not, then you’re automatically a COVID-denier or vaccine-opponent,” Kimmich said. “But there are other people at home, I think, who are simply having thoughts — whatever the reasons are. I think they should be respected, especially if they are sticking to the guidelines.” Neither the German soccer league nor the clubs publicize which players are vaccinated and which are not. Several have contracted the coronavirus since the pandemic began. Kimmich is almost certainly not the only Bundesliga player who isn’t vaccinated, but his stature as a Bayern and Germany leader — he captained Germany in Manuel Neuer’s absence recently — means his statements carry added weight. “As an example, but also for practical reasons, it would be better if he were vaccinated,” former Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said. Rummenigge’s successor Oliver Kahn said that Bayern’s stance as a club is that “we can only recommend to everyone to get vaccinated” but that “you also have to respect if one or another has another opinion.” Bayern coach Julian Nagelsmann is currently self-isolating at home after testing positive for COVID-19 despite being fully vaccinated. Nagelsmann is coping well with the disease and has been conveying messages to assistant coach Dino Toppmöller for the last two games. While most of last season was played without any fans at all present, this season has seen their return under stringent conditions. Most clubs are still operating under the so-called 3G rule – spectators must be vaccinated against COVID-19, have recovered from the disease, or have proof of a negative test result. But some only allow vaccinated or recovered fans to attend games. The same rule doesn’t apply to players or it would mean that Kimmich, and any others who aren’t vaccinated, would not be granted entry. Kimmich said he undergoes tests regularly, and that they are paid for by his club. Former Bayern president Uli Hoeness would not be drawn on his thoughts over Kimmich’s statements. “I have an opinion on the matter, but only for him,” Hoeness said. ___ More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports ___ Ciarán Fahey on Twitter: https://twitter.com/cfaheyAP Ciarán Fahey, The Associated Press",2021-10-25 20:17:16,"BERLIN (AP) — Bayern Munich soccer star Joshua Kimmich has found himself at the center of a debate in Germany over the merits of vaccination against the coronavirus.

Kimmich said he was still considering it and that it was “very possible that I will get vaccinated.” His comments were welcomed by the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has consistently opposed measures against the coronavirus, while they led to dismay among those who are banking on vaccines as a route back toward normalcy at a time when infection rates are climbing again in Germany. “The more people who are vaccinated, the less dangerous the virus will be,” Leipzig’s American coach Jesse Marsch said Monday. Medical expert Alena Buyx, president of the German Ethics Council, said Kimmich is “caught up in misinformation. He is very badly advised. This is something that has now spread, and it would be great if he’d used his platform to get better advice to be a role model in this regard.” Buyx added: “It is important to clarify that these forms of long-term effects do not exist.” German government spokesman Steffen Seibert said Monday that there were “clear and convincing answers” to Kimmich’s questions from national and international experts, and that he hoped that “Kimmich lets all this information work on him and then maybe he can decide in favor of the vaccination.” Kimmich’s reluctance to get vaccinated surprised many due to his involvement in setting up the “We Kick Corona” fundraising campaign with Bayern and Germany teammate Leon Goretzka in March 2020. Together they raised millions for social and charitable organizations to continue working during the pandemic, while some of that money also went to medical associations. “We also donated to UNICEF, who made vaccines available. The point was that there are also countries that do not have access to vaccines,” Kimmich said Saturday after Bayern’s win over Hoffenheim. “I think everyone should make the decision for themselves and it cannot be that someone has no access. Because if you make the decision to do so, then you should do everything you can to ensure that they can get the vaccine.” The player denied being opposed to vaccines. “I think that’s a shame about the debate, that it’s only about being vaccinated or not vaccinated and if you’re not, then you’re automatically a COVID-denier or vaccine-opponent,” Kimmich said. “But there are other people at home, I think, who are simply having thoughts — whatever the reasons are. I think they should be respected, especially if they are sticking to the guidelines.” Neither the German soccer league nor the clubs publicize which players are vaccinated and which are not. Several have contracted the coronavirus since the pandemic began. Kimmich is almost certainly not the only Bundesliga player who isn’t vaccinated, but his stature as a Bayern and Germany leader — he captained Germany in Manuel Neuer’s absence recently — means his statements carry added weight. “As an example, but also for practical reasons, it would be better if he were vaccinated,” former Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said. Rummenigge’s successor Oliver Kahn said that Bayern’s stance as a club is that “we can only recommend to everyone to get vaccinated” but that “you also have to respect if one or another has another opinion.” Bayern coach Julian Nagelsmann is currently self-isolating at home after testing positive for COVID-19 despite being fully vaccinated . Nagelsmann is coping well with the disease and has been conveying messages to assistant coach Dino Toppmöller for the last two games. While most of last season was played without any fans at all present, this season has seen their return under stringent conditions. Most clubs are still operating under the so-called 3G rule – spectators must be vaccinated against COVID-19, have recovered from the disease, or have proof of a negative test result. But some only allow vaccinated or recovered fans to attend games. The same rule doesn’t apply to players or it would mean that Kimmich, and any others who aren’t vaccinated, would not be granted entry. Kimmich said he undergoes tests regularly, and that they are paid for by his club. Former Bayern president Uli Hoeness would not be drawn on his thoughts over Kimmich’s statements. “I have an opinion on the matter, but only for him,” Hoeness said. ___ More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports ___ Ciarán Fahey on Twitter: https://twitter.com/cfaheyAP Ciarán Fahey, The Associated Press",https://s3.amazonaws.com/socast-superdesk/media/20211025201016/617710c2023d16089dbe794ajpeg.jpg,panow,True,"[('AP', 'ORG'), ('Bayern Munich', 'ORG'), ('Joshua Kimmich', 'PERSON'), ('Germany', 'GPE'), ('26-year-old', 'DATE'), ('Kimmich', 'PERSON'), ('Germany', 'GPE'), ('the weekend', 'DATE'), ('COVID-19', 'PERSON'), ('Kimmich', 'PERSON'), ('Germany', 'GPE'), ('Germany', 'GPE'), ('Leipzig', 'GPE'), ('American', 'NORP'), ('Jesse Marsch', 'PERSON'), ('Monday', 'DATE'), ('Alena Buyx', 'PERSON'), ('the German Ethics Council', 'ORG'), ('Kimmich', 'PERSON'), ('Buyx', 'PERSON'), ('German', 'NORP'), ('Steffen Seibert', 'PERSON'), ('Monday', 'DATE'), ('Kimmich', 'PERSON'), ('Kimmich', 'PERSON'), ('Kimmich', 'PERSON'), ('the “We Kick Corona', 'ORG'), ('Bayern', 'ORG'), ('Germany', 'GPE'), ('Leon Goretzka', 'PERSON'), ('March 2020', 'DATE'), ('millions', 'CARDINAL'), ('UNICEF', 'ORG'), ('Kimmich', 'PERSON'), ('Saturday', 'DATE'), ('Bayern', 'ORG'), ('Hoffenheim', 'GPE'), ('Kimmich', 'PERSON'), ('German', 'NORP'), ('Kimmich', 'PERSON'), ('Bundesliga', 'GPE'), ('Bayern', 'ORG'), ('Germany', 'GPE'), ('Germany', 'GPE'), ('Manuel Neuer’s', 'PERSON'), ('Bayern', 'ORG'), ('Karl-Heinz Rummenigge', 'PERSON'), ('Rummenigge', 'GPE'), ('Oliver Kahn', 'PERSON'), ('Bayern', 'ORG'), ('Julian Nagelsmann', 'PERSON'), ('COVID-19', 'ORG'), ('Nagelsmann', 'ORG'), ('Dino Toppmöller', 'PERSON'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('last season', 'DATE'), ('this season', 'DATE'), ('3', 'CARDINAL'), ('COVID-19', 'ORG'), ('Kimmich', 'PERSON'), ('Kimmich', 'PERSON'), ('Uli Hoeness', 'PERSON'), ('Kimmich', 'PERSON'), ('Hoeness', 'ORG'), ('AP', 'ORG'), ('Ciarán Fahey', 'PERSON'), ('Ciarán Fahey', 'PERSON'), ('The Associated Press', 'ORG')]"
Miami private school nixes 30-day quarantine for vaccinated students,https://nypost.com/2021/10/25/miami-school-nixes-30-day-quarantine-for-vaccinated-students/,,['Joshua Rhett Miller'],,"A private school in Miami has reversed course on its controversial plan to force students who got COVID-19 vaccines to quarantine for 30 days, a report said Monday.","A private school in Miami has reversed course on its controversial plan to force students who got COVID-19 vaccines to quarantine for 30 days, a report said Monday.",2021-10-25 20:16:47,"A private school in Miami has reversed course on its controversial plan to force students who got COVID-19 vaccines to quarantine for 30 days, a report said Monday. The about-face by administrators at Centner Academy came after the state threatened to pull funding from the school if it went ahead with the plan, which was based on debunked claims that newly vaccinated people could shed the virus, WPLG reported . Centner’s chief operating officer, Bianca Erickson, assured the Florida Department of Education in a letter Friday that the school would not require any student to “quarantine at home” if vaccinated. “When we announced the subject policy regarding COVID-19, we believed that we were acting in compliance with the Department of Education’s Emergency Rule … which allows a student to be considered in attendance at school when under a ‘stay-home’ directive related to COVID-19,” Erickson wrote. “Our plan at the time included a ‘stay-home’ policy that would be supported by remote learning,” Erickson’s letter continued. “Please note, however, that the plan as announced was not implemented prior to receipt of your letter and we will not pursue any such measures.” State education officials had warned the school in a letter Thursday that the proposed policy would run afoul of the law and could lead to lost funding, WPLG reported. “Recently it has come to our attention that your schools may employ attendance policies which require parents of recently vaccinated students to quarantine their children for unreasonable, unnecessary and unduly burdensome amount of time before returning for in-person instruction,” the letter to the school read. The DOE warned that “swift and decisive” punitive actions against the school could follow, including the revocation of funding. A Post message seeking comment from the school was not returned Monday. The private K-8 school for roughly 300 students — where tuition costs up to $29,850 this year — had informed parents earlier this month that vaccinated students would need to stay home for at least 30 days after each dose and booster they received and could only return afterward if “healthy” and symptom-free. Dr. Aileen Maria Marty, an infectious-disease expert at Florida International University, blasted the message as “very destructive,” WPLG had reported . “That is not written by anyone who has any understanding of the science,” Marty told the station. “It’s just that simple, it’s pure fiction.” The school’s co-founder, David Centner, told WPLG in an email that the policy was designed to protect “students’ well-being and their sense of safety” while at school and based partly on “numerous” anecdotal cases. “Big Pharma itself has created reasonable uncertainty as to whether their product may carry the risk of ‘adverse events’ via inhalation or skin contact to those who are unvaccinated,” Centner added in the email. But Pfizer, maker of the only vaccine currently approved by the FDA for people age 12 and older, flatly told WPLG that its shot doesn’t contain virus particles and therefore they cannot be transmitted to others. “Because there is no virus produced in the body, no shedding occurs within the human body,” Pfizer said in a statement. “The vaccine cannot be inhaled via shedding and can only enter the human body through an administered dose.” A statement on the school’s website regarding its vaccine policy notes that it values “freedom of choice” and religion. “We are proud that our happiness school takes a comprehensive look at vaccine policies statewide, and we accept religious exemptions in lieu of proof of vaccination,” the website reads. Centner Academy also made national headlines in April when it asked its teachers to wait until the end of the school year to get vaccinated. If they did anyway, the educators were told they wouldn’t be able to return for the next academic year, CNN reported .",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Centner-Academy.jpg?quality=90&strip=all,nypost,True,"[('Miami', 'GPE'), ('COVID-19', 'ORG'), ('30 days', 'DATE'), ('Monday', 'DATE')]"
"While Headline Tours Struggle, Festivals Fuel the Concert Biz Comeback",https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/touring/9650608/concert-attendence-down-festivals/,"['Festivals', 'Touring', 'bbpro', 'BottleRock', 'Coronavirus']",['Dave Brooks'],,"This fall the Eagles, Billy Joel and others have seen no-show rates as high as 25% for some concerts -- but outdoor festivals are a brightspot for the touring business.","BottleRock has made playing until the plug gets pulled a rite of passage at their annual Napa, Calif., festival, where the event’s 10 pm curfew is enforced with a kill switch. The sudden loss of amplified sound can be jarring, but when the crowd chimes in to close out song, like they did during this year’s Guns N’ Roses set, bellowing together “Oh, won’t you please take me ho-ome,” the inevitable viral video is marketing gold for the following year’s ticket sales. This year, the high-energy close may have served as a confidence booster for the hard rock band, which recently made its post-pandemic return to the road to play 25 shows postponed from its 2020 tour, as well as 14 new ones in nearby markets. The act’s last big series of concerts was the Not in this Lifetime tour, which made $500 million starting in spring 2016 and became the fourth-highest-grossing in history, according to Billboard Boxscore. Since the concert business started again, however, it is having a hard time getting fans to show up. On average, 10% of fans who bought tickets to see Guns N’ Roses in 2019 and 2020 are coming to its shows, and performances planned for later this year in Mexico and Europe have been pushed back to 2022, amid worries about weak walkup sales. {""nid"":""9648655"",""type"":""post"",""title"":""Live Nation Stock Is Trading Over $100.

This fall, the Eagles, Billy Joel, George Strait, Zac Brown and James Taylor have seen no-show rates as high as 25% for some concerts. Industry executives blame persistent fears about the spread of COVID-19 in indoor venues, even among those who are vaccinated, as well as competition with a flood of other concerts, festivals and destination events. Even for shows that sold out already, that means fewer bodies in seats, as well as waker food, beverage and merchandise sales – plus a blow to the ability to bookers and promoters to plan ahead. Festivals like BottleRock, which sold out “in a matter of minutes” this year company officials say, are a bright spot in the post-pandemic music business, with the majority of such events increasing their attendance over 2019 levels, according to Live Nation’s most recent earnings report. One reason: Outdoor festivals are perceived to be safer than indoor shows. They also provide much better value. “Fans can see so many more acts at a festival for the same price they would pay to attend a big headline tour,” says Bobby Dee, who’s producing the Once Upon a Time in LA festival in December, which features Snoop Dogg, The Game and Al Green and sold out in less than 24 hours. “They are coming out the pandemic and making the decision that they don’t want to spend two hours watching one artist play their set and encore. They want the freedom to roam the event and curate their own experience.” {""nid"":""9649281"",""type"":""post"",""title"":""Neumos in Seattle, in a Pandemic: Ticket Sales Have 'Dropped Off a Cliff'"",""relative_path"":""\/articles\/business\/9649281\/neumos-seattle-pandemic-ticket-sales-no-show-rates\/"",""media"":{""width"":1548,""height"":1024,""extension"":""jpg"",""mime_type"":""image\/jpeg"",""type"":""image"",""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2020\/04\/Steven-Severin-in-a-pandemic-2020-billboard-1548-1587584028-compressed.jpg"",""sizes"":[{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2020\/04\/Steven-Severin-in-a-pandemic-2020-billboard-1548-1587584028-compressed.jpg"",""width"":1548,""height"":1024},{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2020\/04\/Steven-Severin-in-a-pandemic-2020-billboard-1548-1587584028-compressed.jpg"",""width"":1548,""height"":1024}],""orientation"":""landscape"",""id"":""9363693"",""caption"":null,""credit"":null}} With this in mind, artists are rethinking their touring plans for next year and beyond. In most cases, traditional headline concerts pay artists a guaranteed minimum, after which ticket revenue is split with the promoter, which means both sides share risk. Festivals instead offer acts a flat payment, regardless of subsequent ticket sales. That’s appealing to booking agents, who are worried about exposing their clients to risks as the concert business re-opens. It also gives some festivals the chance to book once-in-a-lifetime headliners like Stevie Nicks, who was booked to perform at BottleRock. It can also mean paying huge fees to book headline talent that might not bring in the kind of ticket sales organizers hoped for. In the case of BottleRock, weeks before the event, Nicks announced she couldn’t perform because of “rising COVID cases,” which left organizers to find a replacement big enough to placate customers and hopefully prevent refund requests that would put the festival in financial jeopardy. They secured Chris Stapleton, but he too pulled out the night before he was supposed to take the stage, blaming an unspecified illness. Brandi Carlile, who was already on the lineup, ended up filing in by flying in members of The Highwomen and singer Yola for a special set of their songs and covers. After all that, organizers say refund requests were minimal, speaking to the importance of the festival experience beyond headlining acts. But it shows how festivals may now need multiple backup plans. {""nid"":""9649430"",""type"":""post"",""title"":""How U.K. Touring Is Struggling to Keep On Truckin'"",""relative_path"":""\/articles\/business\/touring\/9649430\/uk-touring-struggling-post-brexit-rules\/"",""media"":{""width"":1548,""height"":1024,""extension"":""jpg"",""mime_type"":""image\/jpeg"",""type"":""image"",""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/10\/Market-global-bb15-2021-billboard-1548-1634755312-compressed.jpg"",""sizes"":[{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/10\/Market-global-bb15-2021-billboard-1548-1634755312-compressed.jpg"",""width"":1548,""height"":1024},{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/10\/Market-global-bb15-2021-billboard-1548-1634755312-compressed.jpg"",""width"":1548,""height"":1024}],""orientation"":""landscape"",""id"":""9648240"",""caption"":null,""credit"":null}} “If festivals continue to dominate in 2021, the major management companies might need to think about creating an on-call network of alternate acts that can step in at the last minute to high profile slots if something goes wrong,” said one agency source at the event. “We’ve got to prepare for a music business that’s going to require more flexibility and contingencies.”   {""account_id"":""1125911414"",""id"":""izFpZKac"",""title"":"""",""featured_media"":""""}",2021-10-25 20:12:30,,https://static.billboard.com/files/2021/10/guns-n-roses-bb15-touring-market-billboard-1548-1634754994-150x150.jpg,billboard,True,"[('BottleRock', 'ORG'), ('Napa', 'GPE'), ('Calif.', 'GPE'), ('10 pm', 'TIME'), ('this year', 'DATE'), ('the following year', 'DATE'), ('This year', 'DATE'), ('25', 'CARDINAL'), ('2020', 'DATE'), ('14', 'CARDINAL'), ('Lifetime', 'ORG'), ('$500 million', 'MONEY'), ('spring 2016', 'DATE'), ('fourth', 'ORDINAL'), ('Billboard Boxscore', 'PERSON'), ('10%', 'PERCENT'), ('Guns N’ Roses', 'ORG'), ('2019', 'DATE'), ('2020', 'DATE'), ('later this year', 'DATE'), ('Mexico', 'GPE'), ('Europe', 'LOC'), ('2022', 'DATE'), ('100', 'MONEY'), ('This fall', 'DATE'), ('Billy Joel', 'PERSON'), ('George Strait', 'PERSON'), ('Zac Brown', 'PERSON'), ('James Taylor', 'PERSON'), ('as high as 25%', 'PERCENT'), ('COVID-19', 'ORG'), ('BottleRock', 'ORG'), ('this year', 'DATE'), ('2019', 'DATE'), ('Live Nation’s', 'ORG'), ('One', 'CARDINAL'), ('Bobby Dee', 'PERSON'), ('the Once Upon a Time', 'LAW'), ('LA', 'GPE'), ('December', 'DATE'), ('Snoop Dogg', 'PERSON'), ('Al Green', 'PERSON'), ('less than 24 hours', 'TIME'), ('two hours', 'TIME'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('Seattle', 'GPE'), ('next year', 'DATE'), ('Stevie Nicks', 'PERSON'), ('BottleRock', 'ORG'), ('BottleRock', 'ORG'), ('weeks', 'DATE'), ('Nicks', 'PERSON'), ('COVID', 'PERSON'), ('Chris Stapleton', 'PERSON'), ('the night', 'TIME'), ('Brandi Carlile', 'ORG'), ('Highwomen', 'PERSON'), ('Yola', 'PERSON'), ('Keep', 'PERSON'), ('2021-billboard-1548-1634755312', 'DATE'), ('2021-billboard-1548-1634755312', 'DATE'), ('2021-billboard-1548-1634755312', 'DATE'), ('2021', 'DATE'), ('the last minute', 'TIME'), ('one', 'CARDINAL')]"

Some bidders are finding it difficult to invest due to sustainability rules that make it tougher for them to buy a stake in an oil refiner, some of the people said. The fresh hurdle to sell the government's entire stake could temper some of the euphoria generated by the recent sale of Air India Ltd to the Tata Group and slow down the nation's biggest privatization drive. The sale of the state-run refiner-cum-fuel retailer would have fetched about $13 billion for the exchequer and other shareholders. BPCL shares fell 3.5 per cent to Rs 431.7 at the close in Mumbai, the most in more than a month, following the Bloomberg News report. The massive price tag means bidders as well as the Indian government want a consortium with stronger technical and financial muscle for the transaction, the people said. Spokesmen at the finance ministry and BPCL weren't immediately available for a comment, while Apollo Global declined to comment. Representatives at Vedanta and I Squared didn't reply to emails seeking comment. India Still Hopes Oil Majors Will Join Race for Biggest Sale.A global push toward green energy and pressure from investors to slash emissions is holding back companies from making large investments in fossil fuels. The pandemic and its fallout has also delayed the process and discouraged global firms from committing big investments in traditional fuels. For BPCL, the bidders have been slow in conducting due diligence as they wait for new partners to join, the people said. That will likely upend the federal government's aim to complete selling its entire 53 per cent holding in BPCL by the end of this financial year in March, for which it had planned to seek financial bids next month. BPCL allowed bidders virtual access to its financial data early April, but it hasn't progressed beyond exchange of a few queries and some initial discussions with the state-run company's management in the past six months. ""Bidders are conducting due diligence, but uncertainty over the bidder consortium and process complexity, including valuation, may lead to potential delays,"" Fitch Ratings Ltd. said in a commentary last month. ""We believe the risks of further Covid-19 waves and global oil and gas companies' increased focus on energy transition lead to additional uncertainty over the timing and valuation of potentially large acquisitions in the sector.""

He continued: ‘In the end, if you can get vaccinated and think of someone else and think of what that could mean to them and their survivability from this, we’d all be better off.’ Speaking on Fox News’ Media Buzz on Sunday, he told viewers: ‘Take the political speaking points and toss them for now. I’m begging you – toss them and think of what’s good, not only for yourself, but for those around you.’ The anchor has multiple sclerosis, underwent triple bypass heart surgery in 2016 and is in remission from stage 4 Hodgkin’s lymphoma. He previously revealed that his doctors said that he would be in a ‘far more dire situation’ without the vaccine, as he told well-wishers: ‘It’s not, because I (got vaccinated) and I’m surviving this because I did.’ Friends cast pay heartfelt tribute to James Michael Tyler as he dies aged 59 Soap stars Chad Duell and Courtney Hope are married in 'Till Death' Friends: Joey writer reveals plot to kill off Ross and Rachel in Matt LeBlanc spin-off Several personalities on Fox News, including Cavuto, Bill Hemmer, Dana Perino, Bret Baier, and Greg Gutfeld, have been public about their vaccinated status. However, their message differs from some popular Fox News colleagues, including Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham. At Fox, employees are required to either be fully vaccinated or to take daily Covid-19 tests. Got a story?

Below, we'll take a closer look at what's driving these two stocks higher on Monday. Image source: Tesla. Tesla looks to $1 trillion Shares of Tesla were up more than 9% Monday afternoon . That brought the stock price to just shy of $1,000 per share, and it sent the electric vehicle pioneer's market capitalization close to the $1 trillion mark. Several factors helped to send Tesla's stock higher. Wall Street analysts have been increasingly optimistic about Tesla's prospects, and analysts at Morgan Stanley boosted their price target on the automaker's stock to $1,200 per share, up by $300 from its previous target. In addition, rental car company Hertz (OTC: HTZZ) made an initial EV order for 100,000 Tesla vehicles, with the expectation of taking delivery by the end of 2022. Tesla's recent earnings report highlighted the huge efforts that the automaker has made to bolster its production capacity. With the company all but certain to reach its 750,000 vehicle-delivery target for 2021, the next step is ensuring that 2022 can take Tesla's deliveries well past the 1 million mark. Tesla stock has been a favorite among individual investors, and the company's fundamental business performance has been impressive as well. Despite constant concerns from some investors about valuation, Tesla's shares have the potential to keep climbing even from current levels. Heading into the cloud Meanwhile, shares of Cloudflare were up more than 5% on Monday afternoon. That left Cloudflare's market capitalization at a much more modest level of $61 billion when compared to Tesla, but the stock has never been higher, and the company has a lot of tailwinds that should support further growth. Edge network services have become increasingly important as more companies rely more heavily on cloud computing and build out their online business presence. Cloudflare has been able to capitalize on this huge demand while avoiding some of the pitfalls that have presented challenges to its peers in the industry. It has attracted some of the biggest companies in the world as clients, and it has been able to retain its customers while encouraging them to increase their spending on cloud-computing services over time. Cloudflare is poised to report earnings in early November, and shareholders are optimistic that the company will be able to sustain its positive momentum. As the global economy recovers, current and potential clients will be in an even better position to scale up their investments in IT development. Expectations are already high for Cloudflare, so earnings results will probably have to be demonstrably superior in order to satisfy investors. When markets hit record highs, there are always strong stocks that are setting the pace. Moves for Tesla and Cloudflare are great examples of exciting investments that are helping to bolster Wall Street as we approach the end of the year.",,fool,True,"[('September', 'DATE'), ('COVID-19', 'ORG'), ('U.S.', 'GPE'), ('1:30 p.m. EDT', 'TIME'), ('89', 'CARDINAL'), ('35,766', 'CARDINAL'), ('24', 'CARDINAL'), ('4,569', 'CARDINAL'), ('136', 'CARDINAL'), ('Monday', 'DATE'), ('Tesla', 'ORG'), ('NASDAQ', 'ORG'), ('Cloudflare', 'ORG'), ('NYSE', 'ORG'), ('NET', 'ORG'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('the months', 'DATE'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('Monday', 'DATE')]"

Yet, in the face of this enormous challenge, some have abandoned reason in favor of hate-fueled actions. Protests began early and spread nearly in sync with the pandemic. The right to protest is a fundamental American right. Unfortunately, some used the coronavirus as a convenient catalyst to focus bigotry on Asians and others. Rules regarding the use of face coverings and promotion of vaccines may have created an inconvenient imposition, yet were met with vitriol directed at ethnic and religious groups and also the leaders of the public health response. One of the most disgraceful and misplaced of the myriad comparisons used to decry the public health measures are Holocaust analogies and Nazi symbols. Earlier this month, a group of protesters outside the Governor’s Mansion displayed enormous banners with swastikas formed out of the image of syringes — equating vaccination with Nazism. Comparing the two makes a mockery of the scale and scope of the Holocaust and the systematic murder by the Nazis of 6 million Jews, including 1.5 million children and millions of other innocents. Extremists have invoked new conspiracies by using old tropes to blame Jews for the pandemic or profiting from it. We have also watched with alarm as protesters have affixed a yellow Star of David to their clothing to protest public health requirements. Jews in Nazi-Germany were forced to wear yellow stars visibly on their clothing so they could be identified as Jews in the aftermath of the violent pogrom Kristallnacht on Nov. 9, 1938. Jews who refused to comply were subject to being shot on the spot. Using a swastika or yellow star as a cheap symbol of protest against the vaccine or mask requirements is odious. The genocide committed by the Nazis resulting in the destruction of two-thirds of European Jewry and one-third of the global Jewish population is not a subject for glib comparisons or politicization. Denying, minimizing or trivializing of the Holocaust is at worst an expression of antisemitism and at best a display of the ignorance of the protester invoking the comparison. Protecting public health should never be equated to the horrors committed by the Nazi regime during the Holocaust. Encouraging vaccinations does not compare to schemes hastening the mass murder of millions of innocent people. Tying the Holocaust to anti-vaccine and anti-mask protests is as shocking as it is inaccurate and offensive. Policies designed to save lives do not equate with policies devised to mete out death. Such offensive analogies by opportunists and fringe groups are an act of moral outrage. By brandishing distrust or outright disdain of research and science, they ridicule history. To be sure, we respect and defend the right to protest. Freedom of expression and the right to assemble are core American values which we cherish. Even so, we condemn the use of antisemitic and other hate-filled slurs or symbols, which are causing deep pain and offense, intentional or not. We believe Utah must be better than this.

He focuses on software, fintech, digital health and consumer investments. More posts by this contributor From startups to Starbucks: The embedded API opportunity How retailers can survive the Amazon era The quest to provide more affordable and accessible healthcare, magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic, has spurred an explosion of innovation, which in turn has attracted massive amounts of capital. To put this into perspective, consider this: In 2019, digital health saw $7.7 billion in VC investment, and that number rose to $14.6 billion in 2020. However, the first half of 2021 alone saw $14.7 billion in VC investment. Its marriage with fintech is the catalyst for the transformation of the healthcare industry. Similar to the unbundling of financial services and how fintech is scaling vertical SaaS, the pandemic-fueled disaggregation of healthcare has created new players that are taking a page out of the fintech revolution book — all starting with payments. A growing number of startups are now leveraging the fintech playbook to solve a key part of the healthcare problem — the shifting dynamics between patients, payers and providers, and how payments and related electronic health records (EHRs) flow between them. Not only is the onus of payments and data flow moving from payers to patients, but providers are now facing a monumental shift to new billing and engagement models, requiring new technologies and platforms to help with the change. Through the lens of fintech, here are three key areas to watch in healthcare. Gamifying consumer wellness to stave off chronic illnesses One of the largest trends impacting the population today is the steady rise of chronic illnesses. It is estimated that nearly half the U.S. population will have a chronic illness by 2025. People are getting sicker for longer periods of time, which leads to a constant spending streak. Patients not adhering to medical guidance is a major factor and is responsible for $100 billion of healthcare spending and over 100,000 deaths annually. With around a fifth of patients never filling their prescriptions, it has become a priority to educate and incentivize patients to complete care and avoid readmissions or ER visits. The convergence of health and fintech will be an important catalyst to address some of the most pressing issues facing healthcare today. To curb the rise of chronic illnesses and the associated recurring costs, many startups are using behavioral economics and gamification to incentivize patients and build healthy habits. For example, companies like Paceline in the U.S., Sweatcoin in Europe and Betterfly in Latin America gamify wellness by combining fitness and financial rewards. On the other hand, startups like Sempre Health and Wellth are tackling medical non-adherence with behavioral economics. For example, Wellth financially rewards actions like on-time prescription intake or regular A1c tests for diabetic patients. Fintech for affordability and reducing friction Looking at payers, there’s a major shift stemming from the rise of high-deductible healthcare plans (HDHP) — enrollment has risen 43% in the last five years — emphasizing an increase in premiums and patient financial responsibility.

How to make fragile global supply chains stronger and more sustainable,https://theconversation.com/how-to-make-fragile-global-supply-chains-stronger-and-more-sustainable-169310,,"['Adel Guitouni', ' Associate Professor', ' International Business', ' University of Victoria']",,,"Shipping containers are moved from the Fairview Cove Container Terminal In Halifax in May 2021. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Andrew Vaughan In 2019, global supply chains moved more than US$19 trillion in exported goods. The production and sale of many items we need and use — including toys, clothes, food, electronics and home furniture — depend on global supply chains. For most of us, supply chains are no longer an abstract concept. The COVID-19 pandemic raised our awareness about the interdependence of our economic systems. We now understand the many ways these chains directly shape and impact our lives. The pandemic has also revealed the fragility of global supply chains as U.S. President Joe Biden and others warn of the impact on the world economy of continuing supply-chain bottlenecks. Cargo container ships are seen anchored outside the Port of Los Angeles in San Pedro, Calif., in the fall of 2021. (AP Photo/Ringo H.W. Chiu) A supply chain is a set of organizations — like suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and retailers — that work together to provide end customers with a specific product or service. The supply chain becomes global when the product or service crosses multiple international boundaries. Global supply chain organizations are directly and indirectly dependent on each other. Supply chain problems cascade Global supply chains have conventionally been focused on achieving financial efficiency above all else. The result is messy and fragile global supply chain systems. In practice, the decisions made and actions taken by each organization affect the performance of the entire supply chain. A problem at any point feeds other problems at different stages of the chain. A product shortage at a retail store, for example, might be caused by unsuspected problems such as labour issues, raw material shortages or clogged ports. Semiconductor shortages are disrupting the automobile industry. Meanwhile, the cost of moving a container from China to the west coast of North America is estimated to have increased by 650 per cent since before the pandemic. Shelves are nearly empty in the paper towel section of a Target store in the U.S. in August 2021 due to COVID-19 supply chain issues. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski) Race to the bottom The pursuit of financial efficiency has shifted global production to low-cost regions, increased the flows of freights, caused port congestion and eroded the resilience of supply chains. Cutting costs above all else became a race to the bottom. It resulted in global economies with limited redundancies, contingencies and safeguards. Fragile global supply chains are exacerbated by the fragmentation of decision-making processes, limited collaboration between buyers and suppliers and transactional management. There is no obvious centralized business or authority commanding and controlling these chains. Instead, several companies co-operate and compete for the value created. Global supply chains also account for large contributions to greenhouse gas emissions and have an impact on air, land and water biodiversity and geological resources. A typical company’s supply chain is responsible for 80 per cent of its greenhouse emissions and more than 90 per cent of its contribution to air pollution generated in the production and distribution of a consumer product. One billion metric tonnes of emissions could be saved if key suppliers to 125 of the world’s biggest purchasers increased their renewable energy input by 20 per cent. The impact of supply chains extends to society. For example, the problem of forced labour is well-documented in today’s global supply chains, resulting in several controversies about modern slavery. More than 24.9 million people are documented to be working in slavery conditions in these chains. Businesses in global supply chains are facing increased pressure from different stakeholders to adopt sustainability and disclose their impacts. A Dutch court recently ordered Shell to reduce its carbon emissions by 45 per cent from its 2019 levels. In the future, supply chain disclosure and transparency will become the norm of good governance.

(AP Photo/Margie Mason) Robust supply chains in demand The world needs robust supply chains that are founded on sustainability, collaboration, trust, transparency, visibility and diversification of supply. That new model of supply chains could help combat economic fragility, climate change and inequality. Global supply chains connect businesses and markets across all layers of economic, social and ecological systems. That means customers, governments and other stakeholders should encourage the emergence of robust and sustainable supply chains. Responsible decision-making within supply chains has the potential to contribute to economic progress and societal well-being while maintaining the environmental integrity of the planet. Our preliminary research on sustainable blueberry supply chains, to be published soon, indicates that sustainability contributes to resilience. Supply chain management is a “team sport.” Current research provides ample evidence that collaboration benefits global supply chains. Buyers and suppliers can enjoy higher service levels, more product availability and significant reductions in costs if they work together. More preliminary research we’ve conducted on personal protective equipment supply chains in British Columbia, also to be published in the weeks to come, shows that collaboration between the supplier and customer reduces costs and risks by at least 17 per cent. Effective collaboration contributes to supply chain resilience and helps avoid future disruptions. A driver for Safecare B.C. secures a load of personal protective equipment in a truck in Surrey, B.C. in April 2020. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jonathan Hayward Building effective collaboration means rewarding responsible and long-term management of global supply chains and discouraging short-lived gains. Global supply chains should promote sharing the gains and the pains among buyers and suppliers. Incentives need to be created to encourage this collaboration. Digitization of the economy will also contribute to better transparency and traceability in global supply chains. Nonetheless, moving towards robust global supply chains isn’t straightforward because historically, they’ve been focused on short-term rewards. For decades, we’ve justified the development of fragile and fragmented global supply chains in the name of economic growth and financial efficiency. This may have provided short-term benefits, but it has created our current supply chain crisis. Will that crisis reveal a way forward?

Though he was connected with fans through social media, important activism campaigns and two live streaming presentations, he admits that it “didn’t compare to the rhythm of work I was used to.” After seeing that the touring industry was reopening and the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines, Fernandez felt confident enough to kick off his 2021 Hecho en Mexico U.S. tour on Sept. 10 at the Grand Sierra Theatre in Reno, Nevada. The 21-date tour, presented by Live Nation, wrapped up on Oct. 24 at the Arizona Federal Theatre in Phoenix. “It was one of the most important tours I have ever had in my career here in the United States,” Fernandez tells Billboard of the gratifying experience. {""nid"":""9531445"",""type"":""post"",""title"":""All the Latin Tours Announced for 2021 (Updating)"",""relative_path"":""\/articles\/columns\/latin\/9531445\/latin-tours-2021-maluma-banda-ms-more\/"",""media"":{""width"":1548,""height"":1024,""extension"":""jpg"",""mime_type"":""image\/jpeg"",""type"":""image"",""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/09\/Jay-Wheeler-chartbreaker-bb13-2021-billboard-1548-1632174256-compressed.jpg"",""sizes"":[{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/09\/Jay-Wheeler-chartbreaker-bb13-2021-billboard-1548-1632174256-compressed.jpg"",""width"":1548,""height"":1024},{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/09\/Jay-Wheeler-chartbreaker-bb13-2021-billboard-1548-1632174256-compressed.jpg"",""width"":1548,""height"":1024}],""orientation"":""landscape"",""id"":""9633011"",""caption"":null,""credit"":null}} Hecho en Mexico also served as a fundraiser for Families Belong Together, where Fernandez donated over $100,000 from the tour proceeds to assist immigrant families separated at the U.S.-Mexico border. “The impact of my concerts goes beyond the money, the box office, and the sold-out shows,” he explains. “I have always been a very sensitive person to things that happen, especially if it happens in my country. The important thing is to be able to start something and for people to come together, to educate and invite them to support these causes. I see it as giving my audience a little bit of what they have given me.” On tour, the Mexican superstar was joined by 25 people on stage, including his full band, his Mexican mariachi, special guests Christian Nodal and his son, Alex Fernández, as well as a handful of guests in different cities. “History repeated itself,” Fernandez, who on many occasions shared the stage with his famed father Vicente Fernandez, expresses. “In fact, Alex was so reserved that I did not contemplate, nor did I know that he wanted to dedicate himself to a musical career.

Eight things we learned from the Facebook Papers,https://www.theverge.com/22740969/facebook-files-papers-frances-haugen-whistleblower-civic-integrity,,['Russell Brandom'],,,"A massive new document release shows chaos and confusion inside the world’s most powerful social network For months, Facebook has been shaken by a steady leak of documents from whistleblower Frances Haugen, beginning in The Wall Street Journal but spreading to government officials and nearly any outlet with an interest in the company. Now, those documents are going much more public, giving us the most sweeping look at the operations of Facebook anyone not directly involved with the company has ever had. The documents stem from disclosures made to the SEC and provided to Congress by Haugen in redacted form. The Verge and a consortium of other news organizations have obtained redacted versions of the documents, which we’re calling The Facebook Papers. In order to receive the documents, we agreed to begin publishing our reporting on them this week, but we are not beholden to report on them in a certain way or coordinate what we cover with other outlets. We’ve already done some reporting on the files, and we’ll keep reporting on them over the coming weeks. (There are a lot of pages.) This isn’t a comprehensive list of everything in the documents, and you should fully expect more to come out. Instead, think of it as a summary of the files that, so far, have stood out to us the most. Hopefully, it will help you make sense of the sheer volume of Facebook news coming out this morning. Facebook was caught off guard by vaccine misinformation in comments Facebook has taken a lot of criticism for its handling of COVID misinformation — including from President Biden, who accused the platform of “killing people” by letting anti-vaxx sentiment run amok — but the leaks show just how chaotic the effort was inside the company. One document dated March 2021 shows an employee raising the alarm about how unprepared the platform was. “Vaccine hesitancy in comments is rampant,” the memo reads. “Our ability to detect vaccine-hesitant comments is bad in English, and basically non-existent elsewhere. We need Policy guidelines specifically aimed at vaccine hesitancy in comments.” (Editor’s note: We are not publishing the document itself since it contains the full name of a Facebook employee.) “Comments are a significant portion of misinfo on FB,” says another employee in an internal comment, “and are almost a complete blind spot for us in terms of enforcement and transparency right now.” “For English posts on Vaccines, vaccine hesitancy prevalence among comments is 50 percent.” The document makes clear that Facebook already had a “COVID-19 lockdown defense” project dedicated to the platform dynamics created by the pandemic, including a workstream dedicated entirely to vaccine hesitancy. That team had also created significant automated flagging systems for misinformation — but according to the files, those simply weren’t being used to downrank anti-vaccine comments. As of the March memo, there were no plans to develop moderation infrastructure like labeling, guidelines, and classifier systems to identify anti-vaccine statements in comments. The failure to meaningfully moderate comments was noticed outside the company. A First Draft News study in May looked at the comments for a handful of major news outlets with more than a million followers and found one in five comments on vaccine-related stories contained some kind of anti-vaccine misinformation. The documents show Facebook was aware of the problem, and First Draft may have even underestimated the issue. One comment on the post reads, “for English posts on Vaccines, vaccine hesitancy prevalence among comments is 50 percent.” Other aspects of the issue remained completely unstudied since the company had yet to dig in on the comment problem. “We currently don’t understand whether Group comments are a serious problem,” the post argues. “It’s clear to us that the ‘good post, bad comment’ problem is a big deal, but it’s not necessarily as clear that [vaccine hesitant] comments on [vaccine hesitant] posts are additive to the harm.” Another document published shortly after April 2021 shows the company still coming to terms with vaccine misinformation. The good news was that there was no evidence of a foreign influence campaign driving anti-vaxx sentiment, as had stung the company in 2016. But the vast majority of content was being sent by a relatively small portion of accounts, suggesting that Facebook had not yet taken the easiest measures to address the issue. Facebook has taken some steps recently to address misinformation in comments — including new downranking rules from just last week. But these documents show those changes came more than six months after the alarm had been raised internally and after Facebook had publicly expressed anxiety about the impending leak. Given the huge surge of COVID deaths among vaccine-skeptical populations over the past three months, it’s easy to see the recent changes as too little, too late. Apple threatened to ban Facebook over online “slave markets” Facebook scrambled to address human trafficking content after Apple threatened to kick its apps off the iOS App Store, a leaked SEV (or Site Event) report shows. The report, referenced briefly by The Wall Street Journal’s Facebook Files reporting, indicates that Apple threatened to pull Facebook and Instagram from iOS on October 23rd of 2019. Apple had been tipped off by a BBC News Arabic report that found domestic workers being sold via Instagram and other apps, where sellers encouraged buyers to mistreat the workers by doing things such as confiscating their passports. the policy was “highly likely leading to exploitation of domestic servants” Facebook had been aware of the problem but hadn’t understood the scope of it, apparently because very little content (less than 2 percent of the material it found) had been reported by users. “Removing our applications from Apple platforms would have had potentially severe consequences to the business,” the Facebook report notes. After Apple escalated the issue, Facebook moderators swept the platforms for keywords and hashtags mentioned in the BBC reporting, ultimately disabling 1,021 accounts and removing 129,121 pieces of content. Facebook also removed a policy exception letting established brick and mortar businesses like recruitment agencies post ads about domestic workers. Facebook determined that even if the businesses were legal, the policy was “highly likely leading to exploitation of domestic servants.” Apple was apparently satisfied with the mitigation measures, and the incident was closed within a week. The Civic Integrity team was often directly blocked by Zuckerberg One of the most alarming incidents uncovered by the papers was that Mark Zuckerberg personally intervened to ensure Facebook would comply with a repressive law instituted in Vietnam, agreeing to moderate more aggressively against “anti-state” content on the platform. The anecdote leads The Washington Post’s report on the papers and plays into a much more troubling dynamic described by Haugen before Congress. Facebook’s Integrity team had lots of ideas for how to make Facebook less harmful, but they were usually overruled, sometimes by Zuckerberg himself. Bloomberg News explores the issue in more detail, showing how the company often found its own efforts to downrank harmful content overwhelmed by the content’s inherent virality. As one employee put it, “I worry that Feed is becoming an arms race.” Politico highlights another employee quote showing just how demoralized the team had become. “If we really want to change the state of our information ecosystem, we need a revolution, not an evolution of our systems,” an employee wrote in October 2019. “If you don’t have enough good content to boost, it doesn’t matter how much you downrank the bad.” Facebook used a German anti-vaccine movement as a test case for more aggressive moderation Another document details Facebook’s so-called “Querdenken experiment,” in which the company’s moderators tested out a more aggressive moderation approach on a German conspiracy movement. Facebook’s Dangerous Content team was already developing a new classification — a “harmful topic community” — and the growing Querdenken was chosen as an experiment on how the classification would work in practice. As a Facebook employee writes in the document, “this could be a good case study to inform how we tackle these problems in the future” “this could be a good case study to inform how we tackle these problems in the future” Querdenken has become one of the leading anti-lockdown and anti-vaccination groups in Germany, with similarities to more extreme groups like QAnon. As the Facebook proposal framed it, the Querdenken movement had potential for violence but wasn’t yet linked to extreme enough activity that would justify banning followers from the platform entirely. The documents give few details about how the experiment proceeded, although clearly, some version of the Querdenken plan was implemented. (A later report says “results from some initial samples look promising.”) And judging by the company’s public statements, it did result in a meaningful change to moderation policy: in September, Facebook announced a new policy on “coordinated social harm,” specifically citing Querdenken as an example of the new approach in action. Unlike many of the other documents, the Querdenken experiment shows Facebook’s moderation system as relatively effective. The company identified the group before it caused significant harm, took action with an eye towards long-term consequences and was transparent about the policy shift after it took place. But the incident shows how complex the interplay of policy and enforcement can be, with broader policies often rewritten with an eye towards specific groups. And for supporters of Querdenken, it may be alarming to learn that the rules of the world’s largest social platform were rewritten specifically to keep their movement from gaining public support. Facebook’s January 6th response was shaped by glitches and delays Facebook discussed developing extreme “break-glass measures” to limit misinformation, calls to violence, and other material that could disrupt the 2020 presidential election. But when former President Donald Trump and his supporters tried to stop successor Joe Biden from being declared president on January 6th, 2021, Facebook employees complained these measures were implemented too late or stymied by technical and bureaucratic hangups. Reports at Politico and The New York Times outline Facebook’s struggle to handle users delegitimizing the elections. Internally, critics said Facebook didn’t have a sufficient game plan for “harmful non-violating narratives” that toed the line between misinformation and content Facebook wants to preserve as free speech. And some plans, like a change that would have prevented Groups from changing their names to terms like “Stop the Steal,” apparently got held up by technical problems. Facebook was trying to rebalance its News Feed for “civic health” The Wall Street Journal first revealed that news outlets and political parties had complained about users favoring negative and hyperbolic content. Facebook was considering ways to fix the problem, and one method involved re-weighting the News Feed to optimize for “civic health” instead of primarily focusing on meaningful social interactions or session time. In a product briefing called “Ranking For Civic Health,” Facebook acknowledged that “people think that political content on Facebook is low quality, untrustworthy, and divisive,” and the current ranking system was “not creating a wholly valuable civic experience for users.” (Based on document comment dates, the document was produced around January and February of 2020.) “people think that political content on Facebook is low quality, untrustworthy, and divisive” The document says Facebook’s ranking algorithm recommended civic content that users themselves didn’t report finding valuable — something earlier leaks have indicated was a problem with meaningful social interactions (MSI) and other engagement-based metrics. “Our current ranking objectives do not optimize for integrity outcomes, which can have dangerous consequences,” it says — for instance, MSI optimization was “contributing hugely to Civic misinfo,” and Facebook estimated that removing it from Civic posts would decrease it by 30 to 50 percent. Facebook tried to improve civic health by asking users explicitly what they thought constituted good civic content. This sometimes revealed even bigger problems — since Facebook apparently found that 20 to 30 percent of respondents “may say that known Civic hate is ‘good for the community’” in surveys. Facebook settled on a strategy to “prioritize the reduction of policy-violating content — such as Civic Hate or Civic Misinfo — even if the individual user finds it valuable” and aimed to reduce the prevalence of civic hate speech, misinformation, and inflammatory content by at least 10 percent. The company ran rebalancing experiments in February 2020 by slightly increasing the amount of “civic” News Feed content that a random set of users saw, then optimizing that content through different metrics (including MSI and whether people thought content was “worth your time”). It also ran a survey to collect how users felt about civic News Feed content. The company aimed to have a new optimization system chosen by March of 2020 — although it’s not clear how the coronavirus pandemic may have changed those plans. Why likes were never hidden on Facebook and Instagram A highly publicized plan from early last year to hide like counts on Instagram never happened because testing the change hurt ad revenue and led to people using the app less. A quiet test of the experience on the Facebook app was also killed after leadership told Zuckerberg that it wasn’t a “top barrier to sharing nor a top concern for people.” A lengthy internal presentation to Zuckerberg about the plan, dubbed Project Daisy, shows that there were concerns among leadership about how the Facebook app would have been perceived if Instagram hid like counts and Facebook did not, which is something employees who were involved in the project have told The Verge. Employees working on Instagram wanted to bill it as a way to depressurize the app for young people, but the team working on the Facebook app wasn’t into the idea. If Instagram went through with hiding likes, the presentation details how leadership at Facebook wanted to “minimize blowback to the Facebook app” for not hiding them and still “ensure credit ladders up to the Facebook company.” Instead of hiding likes for all users by default as was originally planned, Instagram earlier adopted a half measure by letting people opt into hiding their likes. Facebook’s “civic groups” policy stumbled over a simple design flaw In October 2020, Facebook announced that it would stop recommending civic and political groups to users in the US as part of a broader effort to avoid the mistakes of the 2016 election. (The policy was made permanent shortly after the January 6th riot.) But actually keeping those groups out of Facebook recommendation feeds has been a huge challenge for the company — and an internal document gives us new insight into why. The document shows Facebook employees grappling with a public article, flagged by the PR team, which found 30 separate groups still appearing in recommendation feeds in apparent violation of the policy. Escalated on January 19th, the document says many of the groups named in the report had been labeled as civic groups at one point — but were somehow still being recommended as part of facebook’s Groups You Should Join feature. Reducing churn could have solved almost all of the problems “Leakage has been there since Nov 2020 at the least,” the Facebook document reads. It’s not clear which article the document is referring to, but there were a number of reports spotting enforcement failures at the time. The Markup found a bunch of groups slipping through that January and again in June. Even now, it’s not clear the civic groups policy is being enforced as intended. At the time, most observers focused on the conceptual difficulty: it’s a hard philosophical problem to draw a clear line between which groups count as “civic” and even harder to scale it across a platform of Facebook’s size. But the internal report shows the real problem was much simpler. Facebook’s monitoring system (referred to in the report as “Laser”) had been trained to only look at the past seven days of content when determining whether a page fell into the “civic groups” category, which meant pages were constantly filtering in and out as the period viewed by the algorithm changed. In practice, that meant a pro-Trump or pro-Biden group could easily dodge the label by posting a few days worth of less obviously political content. The report estimates that a full 12 percent of labeled groups would churn out of the category from day to day. According to the report, 90 percent of the groups highlighted by the article had been caught by Facebook’s existing “civic groups” classifier — but they’d filtered out as part of the churn. So reducing churn alone could have solved almost all of the problems spotted by the report. There have been lots of stories like this over the past five years: Facebook sets a policy that seems measured and responsible, but a cursory test (usually from a journalist) shows banned content is still easily slipping through. From the outside, it’s often unclear how much of the problem is incompetence at Facebook and how much is just the inherent difficulty of managing a platform of that size. But in this case, the documents put the blame squarely on Facebook as a company. This was a high-profile policy with huge stakes for the country at large, with obvious delicacy in how it was implemented. A churn rate that high made it inevitable that targeted groups would slip through the cracks, and the company simply didn’t notice until reporters called them out.",2021-10-25 15:40:19,,,theverge,True,"[('months', 'DATE'), ('Frances Haugen', 'PERSON'), ('The Wall Street Journal', 'ORG'), ('SEC', 'ORG'), ('Congress', 'ORG'), ('Haugen', 'GPE'), ('The Facebook Papers', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('this week', 'DATE'), ('the coming weeks', 'DATE'), ('this morning', 'TIME'), ('COVID', 'PERSON'), ('Biden', 'PERSON'), ('One', 'CARDINAL'), ('March 2021', 'DATE'), ('Vaccine', 'PERSON'), ('English', 'LANGUAGE'), ('English', 'NORP'), ('Vaccines', 'ORG'), ('50 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('March', 'DATE'), ('First', 'ORDINAL'), ('Draft News', 'ORG'), ('May', 'DATE'), ('more than a million', 'CARDINAL'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('five', 'CARDINAL'), ('First Draft', 'ORG'), ('One', 'CARDINAL'), ('English', 'NORP'), ('Vaccines', 'ORG'), ('50 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('Group', 'ORG'), ('April 2021', 'DATE'), ('2016', 'DATE'), ('just last week', 'DATE'), ('more than six months', 'DATE'), ('COVID', 'PERSON'), ('the past three months', 'DATE'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('App Store', 'PERSON'), ('SEV', 'ORG'), ('Site Event', 'ORG'), ('The Wall Street Journal’s', 'ORG'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('Facebook and Instagram', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('October 23rd of 2019', 'DATE'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('BBC News', 'ORG'), ('Arabic', 'LANGUAGE'), ('Instagram', 'ORG'), ('less than 2 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('BBC', 'ORG'), ('1,021', 'CARDINAL'), ('129,121', 'CARDINAL'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('a week', 'DATE'), ('Civic Integrity', 'ORG'), ('Zuckerberg', 'PERSON'), ('Mark Zuckerberg', 'PERSON'), ('Vietnam', 'GPE'), ('The Washington Post’s', 'ORG'), ('Haugen', 'ORG'), ('Congress', 'ORG'), ('Facebook’s Integrity', 'ORG'), ('Zuckerberg', 'PERSON'), ('Bloomberg News', 'ORG'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('Feed', 'PERSON'), ('Politico', 'PERSON'), ('October 2019', 'DATE'), ('German', 'NORP'), ('Facebook’s', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('German', 'NORP'), ('Querdenken', 'PERSON'), ('Querdenken', 'PERSON'), ('Germany', 'GPE'), ('QAnon', 'ORG'), ('Querdenken', 'PERSON'), ('Querdenken', 'PERSON'), ('September', 'DATE'), ('Querdenken', 'PERSON'), ('Querdenken', 'PERSON'), ('Facebook’s', 'ORG'), ('Querdenken', 'ORG'), ('January 6th', 'DATE'), ('2020', 'DATE'), ('Donald Trump', 'PERSON'), ('Joe Biden', 'PERSON'), ('January 6th, 2021', 'DATE'), ('The New York Times', 'ORG'), ('Facebook’s', 'ORG'), ('Groups', 'ORG'), ('Stop the Steal', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('News Feed', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('The Wall Street Journal', 'ORG'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('the News Feed', 'ORG'), ('Ranking For Civic Health', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('MSI', 'ORG'), ('MSI', 'ORG'), ('Civic', 'PRODUCT'), ('Civic', 'ORG'), ('30 to 50 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('20 to 30 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('Civic', 'ORG'), ('Civic Hate', 'ORG'), ('Civic Misinfo', 'PERSON'), ('at least 10 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('February 2020', 'DATE'), ('MSI', 'ORG'), ('March', 'DATE'), ('2020', 'DATE'), ('Facebook and Instagram', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('early last year', 'DATE'), ('Instagram', 'ORG'), ('Zuckerberg', 'PERSON'), ('Zuckerberg', 'PERSON'), ('Project Daisy', 'PERSON'), ('Instagram', 'ORG'), ('Instagram', 'ORG'), ('Instagram', 'PERSON'), ('Instagram', 'ORG'), ('half', 'CARDINAL'), ('October 2020', 'DATE'), ('US', 'GPE'), ('2016', 'DATE'), ('January 6th', 'DATE'), ('30', 'CARDINAL'), ('January 19th', 'DATE'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('facebook’s Groups You Should Join', 'ORG'), ('Nov 2020', 'DATE'), ('Markup', 'PERSON'), ('January', 'DATE'), ('June', 'DATE'), ('Facebook’s', 'ORG'), ('the past seven days', 'DATE'), ('pro-Biden', 'PERSON'), ('a few days', 'DATE'), ('a full 12 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('90 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('Facebook’s', 'ORG'), ('the past five years', 'DATE')]"

The crew will liftoff on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Launch Complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The Crew Dragon Endurance is scheduled to dock to the space station at 12:10am EST (5:10am BST) Monday, November 1. Prelaunch activities, launch, and docking will air live on NASA Television, the NASA app, and the agency’s website. What is SpaceX? Here's what you need to know... SpaceX is a cash-flushed rocket company that wants to take man to Mars. It was set up by eccentric billionaire Elon Musk in 2002 and is based in Hawthorne, California. SpaceX’s first aim was to build rockets that can autonomously land back on Earth for refurbishment and re-use. The technology makes launching and operating space flights more efficient, and therefore cheaper. SpaceX currently uses its reusable Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets to fly cargo to the International Space Station (ISS) for Nasa. It also carries satellites and other space tech into orbit for various government agencies and multinational companies. The company took astronauts to the ISS for the first time in 2020. Other future missions involve carrying tourists to the ISS and astronauts to the Moon and Mars. Musk has repeatedly said he believes humanity must colonise Mars to save itself from extinction. He plans to get a SpaceX rocket to the Red Planet by 2027.

Pfizer recently submitted data to Health Canada to get its COVID-19 vaccine approved for use in children aged five to 11. The physician town hall Thursday night — a meeting meant to provide information and answer questions for doctors in the province — talked about pediatric cases of COVID-19. In a presentation, pediatrician Dr. Mahli Brindamour said during the week of Oct. 17 there were 17 kids in hospital, the most there have been. Brindamour also explained that while deaths due to COVID-19 are rare in kids, they do happen. Throughout the country, there have been 18 deaths in children up to the age of 18. In Saskatchewan, three children under 12 have died from COVID-19, which is 16 per cent of all pediatric deaths in Canada. Shahab said the reason child COVID cases make up a third of those in the province is, in part, because kids either couldn’t or still can’t, be vaccinated. But he said that can be mitigated by everyone around kids being vaccinated. “If all parents had a 99 per cent vaccination (rate), and school staff (got vaccinated) – and I see no reason why that shouldn’t happen – even in unvaccinated children under 11, our case numbers would go down to maybe 10, 15 from 90 a day,” said Shahab. Shahab thinks all school and daycare staff should be fully vaccinated or submit to testing if they’re not. Though graphs from the physician town hall show an increase in child cases after the school year started, Shahab said only about 23 per cent of cases health officials could trace come from schools. He said household exposure was 47 per cent and there was a linkage with unvaccinated households. “Most of the schools, when they report a case, it’s one case and a few report two or three cases. I have not seen dozens of cases in schools or large outbreaks in schools. And that speaks to the layers of protection that schools learned how to apply last year and are applying now,” said Shahab. When kids as young as five can get their shots, Shahab said he expects a high uptake in that group “because that’ll then definitely bring rates down in that age group.” —",2021-10-25 15:02:17,"Through the pandemic, about a third of cases in Saskatchewan have been in kids and teens, so as cases have gone up in Saskatchewan the last few months, so have cases in kids.

Why your sex drive could be low – and what to do about it,https://metro.co.uk/2021/10/25/why-your-sex-drive-could-be-low-and-what-to-do-about-it-15482686/,"['Sex', 'Health', 'Relationships']",['Michele Theil'],,Struggling to get in the mood? You're not alone.,"Stress is a common reason for a low sex drive (Picture: Getty) Losing interest in sex is common from time to time, but a persistent low sex drive can become a cause for concern – especially if it’s affecting your relationship. Though there are many reasons behind a low libido, there is less information about what you can do to increase your sex drive, if that is what you want. Stress is one of the main causes of a low sex drive, whether that is work-related, financial worries, or something else altogether. Additionally, things like poor body image can affect your self-esteem, which may make you feel less attractive and therefore be uninterested in sex, as well as previous negative sexual experiences or abuse which can lead to traumatic memories associated with sex. Certain types of medication can affect sex drive, particularly anti-depressants, anti-anxiety medications like Xanax, or any kind of benzodiazepines and beta-blockers, birth control pills and also opioids. As oral contraceptives have hormones in them, it can either decrease or increase your sex drive depending on the person, despite being one of the most effective ways of preventing pregnancy. Narendra Pisal, a consultant gynaecologist at London Gynaeocology, says: ‘Contraception is known to affect sex drive, but the effect is variable and the available evidence is equivocal.’ Medications, drugs, alcohol, and smoking can all lower libido (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto) ‘There are some studies which have shown reduced sexual desire due to the lowering of testosterone levels,’ she says. Most of us are aware that using contraception is necessary to prevent pregnancy, and while there are other options available if hormonal birth control is not working for you and your sex drive, Pisal also suggests that ‘condoms can also affect sexual desire due to fear of pregnancy (if it breaks) and also having to stop to put it on.’ While there are ways of changing up your birth control or medication when it is affecting your sex drive by yourself, Pisal recommends talking ‘to a women’s health expert in your GP practice and they may be able to give you advice’. Marijuana, though illegal in the UK for recreational use, can also be an issue when it comes to libido. Although some people have anecdotally reported that having sex after smoking marijuana can increase the sensations of sex. As there is not much clinical evidence about the causes of low libidos, we can only speculate as to the reasons behind it, and there is a lot of trial and error involved in trying to pinpoint why it’s happening and how to fix it. One worry for some people is that being disinterested in sex may mean your partner could feel like you are no longer in love with them or no longer find them attractive. This isn’t always the case at all, but having this fear can put a strain on your relationship. Parvinder Sagoo, a superintendent pharmacist and clinician at SimplyMedsOnline explained that to counteract this problem, ‘communication is key’. He says: ‘Talk to your partner and try to help them understand that you still love them and find them attractive even if you are lacking interest in sex.’ Fluctuations in sexual desire are both normal and subject to various environmental factors (Picture: Getty) Sagoo also recommends relationship counselling if the issue is ongoing, or more generalised professional therapy to deal with the other issues in your life that are contributing to a low libido in order to ‘get to the root of the problem’. For those who want to ensure continued intimacy and a healthy relationship with their partner, blocking out time for date nights and allowing plenty of time to engage in foreplay to increase your excitement and libido, rather than trying to fit in a ‘quickie’ before work or bed can be positive in your relationship if a decreased libido is affecting it. ‘If you find certain medication is affecting your sex drive, then you may want to try different medications or dosages to bring it back,’ Sagoo says, adding that ‘changing your lifestyle habits, eating well, drinking plenty of water, and cutting out alcohol and smoking’ will also help to increase your libido, even if its marginal.

Exercise can also be a great way of increasing your libido, as it provides endorphins which will increase your self-esteem, and make you happier and more receptive to sex. Additionally, though low libido can be another cause for stress for you and your partner, worrying too much about it will make it snowball into an entirely separate issue and will further impact your sex drive. So, if you are suffering from low libido, the first thing you should do is acknowledge that while there is an issue, there are many ways to improve your sex drive. Sex is of course important to many of us, but fluctuations in sexual desire are both normal and subject to various environmental factors, and feeling like you are the problem or trying a ‘quick fix’ will not help you (or your partner) in the long run.

Sarah Buckle is ‘terrified’ at the thought that the culprit is still on the loose, six weeks after she was hosptalised on a night out. The 19-year-old has approached her constituency MP, Theresa May, and the Home Secretary, Priti Patel, calling for clubs to be made to introduce safety and security precautions to protect guests from injections with needles and substances slipped into drinks. The University of Nottingham student said she collapsed and began choking after falling ill on the night out and is ‘really scared’ that whoever was responsible has not been caught by police. After arriving in the club, which she does want to name, at around 11pm her last memory is meeting some friends at the bar before she was discharged from hospital around 10 hours later. Sarah spoke after an outcry over needles being used to spike women with powerful so-called date rape drugs at nightclubs across the UK. ‘It all came out of nowhere,’ she said. ‘My friends said I stopped talking and I tried typing something on my phone but it wasn’t making sense. I wasn’t able to speak or stand up, so security said to me to leave. ‘My friends got in a taxi with me and at this point I started really violently throwing up. Apparently I started screaming as well and I was going unconscious. I was in and out of this horrible state. In the taxi they called an ambulance to meet us at the house. ‘When the ambulance arrived I was unconscious and choking.’ Sarah’s left hand was throbbing and a mark resembling a pin-prick on the back suggests a needle was used, but she also believes there is a chance her drink could have spiked. ‘However it happened it doesn’t change the fact that women are in danger,’ she said. ‘It’s really important that nightclubs take responsibility to ensure these attacks are less likely to happen and they need to introduce protocols such as mandatory searches, providing bottle stoppers and lid covers and having no CCTV blind spots. ‘Staff also need to be informed what to look out for after and be more sympathetic to the fact that not everyone has had too much to drink. ‘The government needs to make sure it is easier for hospitals and police to communicate, collect and share evidence. I don’t think we’ll ever eradicate these attacks, but we can make them less likely.’ Sarah Buckle says she has suffered anxiety since she was the victim of a spiking incident in a Nottingham club (Picture: Sarah Buckle) In her letter to the MPs, the management student says that in the past few days she has been approached by ‘hundreds of young women who have experienced similar incidents to me, or have recommendations about measures which can be implemented to help prevent further attacks’. The suggestions also include making it mandatory for clubs to scan IDs on entry and exit, recording who was in a venue at a certain time. Although there has been a national outcry and police forces have made a number of arrests, the second year’s case is still being investigated. She told Metro.co.uk that because her tests weren’t taken at an optimal time when the incident occurred on September 28 or in the early hours of the following day, it’s unlikely they will show anything once they have been examined in a laboratory. Sarah Buckle woke up in hospital after a night out with no memory of how she got there and a throbbing pain in her left hand (Picture: ITV) A night out with friends turned into an ordeal for Sarah Buckle after she was administered an incapacitating substance (Picture: Sarah Buckle) ‘I’m terrified at the fact that whoever did this is still out there,’ she said. ‘I’m really, really scared. That’s another reason why I’m demanding that the government does more to protect women. ‘I understand it is hard to make arrests and secure convictions so it’s important to make sure that those responsible have little chance to carry out these attacks again. ‘I’ve suffered extreme anxiousness that this could happen again to me or my friends. It makes you question everyone. Sarah Buckle found a mark resembling a pin-prick on her hand but believes there is also a chance she could have had her drink spiked (Picture: Sarah Buckle) ‘It was at a freshers’ night and while you think of middle age men harassing young women, it could have been someone I go to university with. ‘Who knows? It’s a really scary thought.’ Sarah joined calls from students and other women demanding the government and nightclub industry does more to tackle the problem. One petition, on the government’s dedicated website, calls for all venues to be legally required to ‘thoroughly search’ guests on entry. More than 167,000 people have signed to date. A dozen reports have been made to Nottinghamshire Police of people’s drinks being spiked since September 4, with the largest number being made last weekend. A spate of cases where women have been spiked in nightclubs have been reported to police (Picture: Getty Images/iStockphoto) Two men were arrested last week on suspicion of administering poison in connection with the spate of allegations. They were held ‘on suspicion of conspiracy to administer poison with intent to injure, annoy or aggrieve’ before being released under investigation. The arrests are not being linked to any specific allegation of spiking by a needle, or contamination of a drink, and followed information from a member of the public after a general appeal from a senior officer. Nottinghamshire Police said last week that it would deploy extra officers to ensure people can enjoy a ‘safe night out’.

After arriving in the club, which she does want to name, at around 11pm her last memory is meeting some friends at the bar before she was discharged from hospital around 10 hours later. Sarah spoke after an outcry over needles being used to spike women with powerful so-called date rape drugs at nightclubs across the UK. ‘It all came out of nowhere,’ she said. ‘My friends said I stopped talking and I tried typing something on my phone but it wasn’t making sense. I wasn’t able to speak or stand up, so security said to me to leave. ‘My friends got in a taxi with me and at this point I started really violently throwing up. Apparently I started screaming as well and I was going unconscious. I was in and out of this horrible state. In the taxi they called an ambulance to meet us at the house. ‘When the ambulance arrived I was unconscious and choking.’ Sarah’s left hand was throbbing and a mark resembling a pin-prick on the back suggests a needle was used, but she also believes there is a chance her drink could have spiked. ‘However it happened it doesn’t change the fact that women are in danger,’ she said. ‘It’s really important that nightclubs take responsibility to ensure these attacks are less likely to happen and they need to introduce protocols such as mandatory searches, providing bottle stoppers and lid covers and having no CCTV blind spots. ‘Staff also need to be informed what to look out for after and be more sympathetic to the fact that not everyone has had too much to drink. ‘The government needs to make sure it is easier for hospitals and police to communicate, collect and share evidence. I don’t think we’ll ever eradicate these attacks, but we can make them less likely.’ In her letter to the MPs, the management student says that in the past few days she has been approached by ‘hundreds of young women who have experienced similar incidents to me, or have recommendations about measures which can be implemented to help prevent further attacks’. The suggestions also include making it mandatory for clubs to scan IDs on entry and exit, recording who was in a venue at a certain time. Although there has been a national outcry and police forces have made a number of arrests, the second year’s case is still being investigated. She told Metro.co.uk that because her tests weren’t taken at an optimal time when the incident occurred on September 28 or in the early hours of the following day, it’s unlikely they will show anything once they have been examined in a laboratory. ‘I’m terrified at the fact that whoever did this is still out there,’ she said. ‘I’m really, really scared. That’s another reason why I’m demanding that the government does more to protect women. ‘I understand it is hard to make arrests and secure convictions so it’s important to make sure that those responsible have little chance to carry out these attacks again. ‘I’ve suffered extreme anxiousness that this could happen again to me or my friends. It makes you question everyone. ‘It was at a freshers’ night and while you think of middle age men harassing young women, it could have been someone I go to university with. ‘Who knows? It’s a really scary thought.’ Sarah joined calls from students and other women demanding the government and nightclub industry does more to tackle the problem. One petition, on the government’s dedicated website , calls for all venues to be legally required to ‘thoroughly search’ guests on entry. More than 167,000 people have signed to date. A dozen reports have been made to Nottinghamshire Police of people’s drinks being spiked since September 4, with the largest number being made last weekend. Two men were arrested last week on suspicion of administering poison in connection with the spate of allegations. They were held ‘on suspicion of conspiracy to administer poison with intent to injure, annoy or aggrieve’ before being released under investigation. The arrests are not being linked to any specific allegation of spiking by a needle, or contamination of a drink, and followed information from a member of the public after a general appeal from a senior officer. Nottinghamshire Police said last week that it would deploy extra officers to ensure people can enjoy a ‘safe night out’.

I believe even if you aren’t yeehaw-crawling-over-broken-glass-to-get-one, that if at all possible, as an act of kindness, as a ‘take-one-for-the-team’, as a ‘let’s do-whatever-we-can-to-make-this- world-better’, that ‘I- would-consider-it-a-personal-favor’, that ‘even-if-you-are sure-you-can-fight-it’, you ‘take-it-for-the-young-and-the-elderly-and-the-healthcare-professionals-and-the-canceled-surgery-patients,’ and on and on. Please. Or unsubscribe, that’s fine. I’ll miss you, but fine. While I typically love readers’ responses to my enewsletter – please save your time if you are an anti-vaxxer, let’s just agree to disagree on this one. *** Now back to our regularly scheduled enews… I didn’t read the manual, I didn’t know what to do, I just made it up, I guessed. And I guessed wrong. My daughter was just 5, getting ready to go to kindergarten and I was gearing up to get her immunizations. And so I told her words that I regret to this very day, “We are going for a surprise!” I don’t know what I could have possibly been thinking – how on earth I thought this was a smart idea but that’s what I did and well you can just imagine the fiasco that ensued. To this day my daughter, now 30, hates surprises and really, really dislikes that I did this to her. I am scarred from scarring her! I am reminded of this long-ago time now because soon COVID vaccines will be available for the children and if I had to do it over again, I would do it so much differently. Maybe something like.. Kara, tomorrow I’m going to take you to get a needle in your arm. It’s probably going to hurt a little bit, I know mine does when I get a needle. I want you to know that you are safe and I’m here for you. The reason we are getting the needle is to help us stay healthy. It hurts a bit and you might want to cry a little and that’s ok, but you will be safe and I’m going to be right here for you and we can cuddle up and be a little sad together when it’s over. But soon after that, it’s not going to hurt anymore and we will go do something fun together. Even though you are getting a needle in your arm, you will be safe, I will be here for you and you can cry if you want to. I would repeat this over and over and over until her vaccine was administered. Parents aren’t perfect, we can’t have a redo – but if we could, I’d sure take it on this particular incident. Somehow it seems kids remember the things we did wrong a lot more than the things we did right. Oh well, if we are lucky they love us anyway. They say, ‘When we know better, we do better.’ I don’t always agree with this sentiment as many times I do know better but I do ‘the other’ anyway! In this case, though, I sure wish I knew better and I sure wish I had done better. Everyone wants to feel safe. People are getting the vaccine to feel safe. Some people are choosing not to get the vaccine because that feels safer for them. In a world already so divided, it makes me so sad we have yet another reason to disagree. We all just want to feel safe – in the end, maybe that can connect us after all. To our health, Steph The post To our health! first appeared on Your Life Unlimited.

An advisory panel for the FDA will consider that company's application on Tuesday.Top health officials, like Dr. Anthony Fauci, have said they believe the vaccine will be approved for emergency use in kids and the U.S. could start seeing the age group being vaccinated in early November.“So if all goes well, and we get the regulatory approval, and the recommendations from the CDC, it's entirely possible, if not, very likely that vaccines will be available for children from 5 to 11 within the first week or two of November,” said Fauci told CNN on Sunday.",2021-10-25 14:28:54,,,wcpo,True,"[('Moderna', 'PERSON'), ('Monday', 'DATE'), ('COVID-19', 'PRODUCT'), ('ages 6 to 11', 'DATE'), ('two 50', 'CARDINAL'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('Moderna', 'PERSON'), ('28 days', 'DATE'), ('Moderna', 'PERSON'), ('Moderna', 'DATE'), ('the Food and Drug Administration', 'ORG'), ('FDA', 'ORG'), ('European Medicines Agency', 'ORG'), ('EMA', 'ORG'), ('6 to under 12 years', 'DATE'), ('Stéphane Bancel', 'PERSON'), ('Moderna', 'GPE'), ('COVID-19', 'ORG'), ('Pfizer', 'PERSON'), ('ages 5 to 11', 'DATE'), ('FDA', 'ORG'), ('Tuesday', 'DATE'), ('Anthony Fauci', 'PERSON'), ('U.S.', 'GPE'), ('early November', 'DATE'), ('CDC', 'ORG'), ('5 to 11', 'CARDINAL'), ('the first week', 'DATE'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('November', 'DATE'), ('Fauci', 'ORG'), ('CNN', 'ORG'), ('Sunday', 'DATE')]"

But, unfortunately for those feeling a bit queasy, it does involved more booze… Getty - ContributorYou could beat your hangover with one simple trick… But an expert warns it could be dangerous[/caption] Dr Karl Kruszelnicki shared his simple trick to bounce back from the abyss after a heavy night. The 73-year-old from Australia told listers of his podcast: “Unfortunately, a cure is just a bit of alcohol – the hair of the dog – which is a bad pathway to go down.” This is because drinking more alcohol stops the body absorbing methanol – a toxic chemical found in booze. It instead forces the body to deal with the new ethanol (the main proportion of alcohol). However, this isn’t helpful in the long run, as you do have to face the music and absorb the methanol at some point. And, the expert warns some people can feel so much better they then lean towards developing alcoholism.

BRAIN GAME The 7 simple lifestyle hacks that can help reduce your risk of Alzheimer's SPOT THE DIFFERENCE Shocking X-rays reveal the huge difference Covid vaccines really make SWEET RELIEF The secret hack using just your hands that can 'cure' constipation So while it is a sure fire way to feel immediately more human, he said the safest way is to simply ride it out. Drink lots of water, eat what you fancy and get some sleep and you should beat the hangover in no time. Of course, the best way to avoid a hangover is to drink moderately on the night. Lining your stomach with a carb or fat-heavy meal before boozing slows down the rate of alcohol absorption, something you’ll be thankful for in the morning. Also, it can be handy to avoid dark-coloured drinks that contain natural chemicals called congeners (impurities), which irritate blood vessels and tissue in the brain and can make a hangover much worse. Other ways to soother a hangover: 1. Rehydrate Booze can make you expel up to four times as much water, which is why you always feel like a slug in a salt mine the morning after. Make sure you drink lots of water before you go to sleep, but well, we all know how hard that is once you’ve knocked back a thousand tequilas and passed out on the front step. GP Sarah Garsed at online health and wellness platform RWL says water is your best friend and will flush toxins out of your system. Isotonic drinks can also give you an extra boost and replace lost fluids. 2. Snooze Alcohol loves to rob us of good quality sleep. This is because it inhibits the release of the sleep hormone melatonin, meaning it can be hard to get to sleep, difficult to have good quality sleepand you may also find you wake up early unable to get back to sleep. “Sleep is one of the most restorative things for a hangover so if youneed it, take a nap the following day” Dr Sarah added. 3. Medicate Reach for the painkillers to help with head or muscle aches. Stick to paracetamol-based remedies as aspirin can increase nausea. Take an antacid if you have a dodgy stomach and need it settling. 4. Drink herbal tea As well as plenty of water, hot drinks can help revive your body and mind. Ginger tea can help with nausea and milk thistle tea cleanses the liver, while hot water with honey and lemon boosts blood sugar. 5. Exercise if you can Depending on how bad your hangover is, exercise might seem like the last thing you want to do, BUT it could be the best thing for you, Dr Sarah says. After drinking a lot of your natural feel-good brain chemicals can be left significantly reduced, leaving you feeling low in energy and mood. 6. Eat something If your hangover is particularly bad and you are struggling to stomach much food, try a cold orange juice to get yourself back to being match ready. “Orange juice can have a acid-neutralising effect when it is metabolised by the body and delivers a big does of potassium which helps to rehydrate you and restore any lost minerals. “Orange juice is also high in natural sugar, which can help bring that low blood sugar up and reduce feelings of nausea”, Dr Sarah said.

Amazon brings Alexa to hospitals and senior living centers,https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/amazon-brings-alexa-to-hospitals-and-senior-living-centers/,"['Hardware', 'Health']",['Sarah Perez'],,"After already targeting verticals like hotels and apartment complexes, Amazon announced today it’s now rolling out new solutions for healthcare providers and senior living centers.

The solutions, which are a part of Alexa Smart Properties, are designed specifically to meet the needs of deploying Alexa devices at scale and will allow the facility’s administrators to create customized experiences for their residents or patients. In senior living centers, the residents would be able to use Alexa devices to call their family members and other loved ones, as well as keep up with the goings-on at their community and other community news. The devices could also be used to make announcements, allow the residents to communicate with each other through direct audio messages, make voice and video calls, and they can streamline other center activities — like check-ins, maintenance requests, and various administrative tasks. Amazon believes this could help make facilities more efficient and productive. Amazon says senior living communities include Atria and Eskaton will integrate with its new solution. The market for using Alexa in senior living communities was already being explored by third-party providers, like K4Connect, which last year closed on $21 million in Series B funding to bring newer technologies, including Alexa’s voice assistance, to older adults and those living with disabilities. Companies like K4Connect and others, including Lifeline Senior Living, Aiva, and Vocera, can now tap into Alexa Smart Properties’ tools and APIs to make it easier for them to roll out their own, customized solutions and software. Image Credits: Amazon Meanwhile, Amazon had already piloted putting Alexa in patient rooms in a test with Cedars-Sinai, which allowed patients to use voice commands for performing basic tasks, like changing TV channels, as well as communicating with caregivers. The idea was that, by offloading some of the everyday tasks to Alexa, it could free up nurses to focus more on medical care. With Amazon’s new solution for hospitals, patients will be able to use Alexa to communicate with care staff, control the devices in their room, and stay entertained with news and music. Healthcare providers can also communicate with their patients using Alexa features like calling and Drop-In, without having to enter the patient rooms. This could also help hospitals be more productive and conserve their medical supplies and protective equipment like gloves, masks, and gowns, notes Amazon. (PPE shortages had been an ongoing issue in some locations as Covid spiked during the pandemic.) Cedars-Sinai is among those officially rolling out the Alexa Smart Properties solution, following its pilot program, and is joined by BayCare and Houston Methodist, Amazon says. “Voice is intuitive for patients, regardless of age or tech-savviness,” said Peachy Hain, executive director of Medical and Surgical Services at Cedars-Sinai, in a statement. “Since it’s so easy to operate, patients can use Alexa to connect with their care team and stay entertained as soon as they settle in, while care providers can streamline tasks to make more time to care for those patients. It’s a total gamechanger for enhancing our hospital experience,” Hain added. Though Amazon has struggled with privacy issues related to its use of voice recordings and transcriptions, the healthcare and senior living center solutions will not save the voice recordings and don’t require users to share personal info with Alexa to use the device, the company explains. Users can also mute the Echo’s microphone at any time with the button on top. Amazon also claims it safeguards protected health information received through HIPAA-eligible Alexa skill interactions. Amazon has been working to bring Alexa to healthcare facilities for some time. A report in 2018 by CNBC had said the company was building out a healthcare team with Alexa in order to make the voice assistant useful in the industry. This included working through the complex HIPAA regulations that would be required to do so. The following year, Amazon announced its first HIPAA-compliant medical skills and began piloting its devices in hospitals. Elsewhere across Amazon, the company has invested in healthcare solutions in other ways, including through solutions like Amazon Comprehend Medical, a machine learning tool that gathers information from things like doctors’ notes and patient health records, and acquisitions like online pharmacy PillPack. Both of the new Alexa Smart Properties solutions will roll out in the U.S. starting next month, Amazon says.",2021-10-25 14:00:10,,,techcrunch,True,"[('Amazon', 'ORG'), ('today', 'DATE'), ('Alexa', 'ORG'), ('Alexa', 'ORG'), ('Alexa', 'ORG'), ('Amazon', 'ORG'), ('Amazon', 'ORG'), ('Atria', 'GPE'), ('Eskaton', 'ORG'), ('Alexa', 'ORG'), ('third', 'ORDINAL'), ('last year', 'DATE'), ('$21 million', 'MONEY'), ('Alexa', 'ORG'), ('Lifeline Senior Living, Aiva', 'ORG'), ('Vocera', 'PERSON'), ('Alexa', 'ORG'), ('Amazon', 'ORG'), ('Amazon', 'ORG'), ('Alexa', 'ORG'), ('Cedars-Sinai', 'ORG'), ('Alexa', 'ORG'), ('Amazon', 'ORG'), ('Alexa', 'ORG'), ('Healthcare', 'ORG'), ('Alexa', 'ORG'), ('Drop-In', 'ORG'), ('Amazon', 'ORG'), ('PPE', 'ORG'), ('Covid', 'PERSON'), ('Cedars-Sinai', 'ORG'), ('Alexa', 'ORG'), ('BayCare', 'ORG'), ('Houston Methodist', 'ORG'), ('Amazon', 'ORG'), ('Peachy Hain', 'PERSON'), ('Medical and Surgical Services', 'ORG'), ('Cedars-Sinai', 'FAC'), ('Alexa', 'ORG'), ('Hain', 'PERSON'), ('Amazon', 'ORG'), ('Alexa', 'ORG'), ('Amazon', 'ORG'), ('Alexa', 'ORG'), ('Amazon', 'ORG'), ('Alexa', 'ORG'), ('2018', 'DATE'), ('CNBC', 'ORG'), ('Alexa', 'ORG'), ('The following year', 'DATE'), ('Amazon', 'ORG'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('Amazon', 'ORG'), ('Amazon Comprehend Medical', 'ORG'), ('PillPack', 'PRODUCT'), ('Alexa', 'ORG'), ('Smart Properties', 'ORG'), ('U.S.', 'GPE'), ('next month', 'DATE'), ('Amazon', 'ORG')]"

It will be mandatory to be fully vaccinated at least 14 days prior to departure for China, in order to be allowed in the closed loop system without quarantine. Anyone not fully vaccinated according to the Playbooks will need to quarantine for 21 days upon arrival in Beijing. Exceptions may be granted for athletes and team officials on a case-by-case basis, based on medical reasons.Test, trace and isolate: Strict protocols will be in place to identify who has the COVID-19 virus as early as possible through testing; to understand to whom the virus might have been passed through contact tracing; and to use isolation and quarantine to stop the virus from spreading further.Minimise Physical Interaction: COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through small liquid particles in our breath exhaled by coughing, sneezing, talking, shouting or singing. That’s why it’s important to be vaccinated, minimise physical interaction, wear a mask, and avoid: spaces that are enclosed, crowded or involve close contact.Think Hygiene: The basics of good hygiene are important to keeping everyone safe – regularly and thoroughly cleaning our hands, disinfecting surfaces, avoiding touching our face, and wearing a face mask at all times.COVID-19 Liaison Officers: Every organisation taking part in the Games will soon be asked to nominate COVID-19 Liaison Officer(s) (CLO).

Locsin recalled the 75th anniversary of the UN in 2020, which was marked “in a somber mood” because of COVID-19, and said that “though we are still not out of the woods, we now have the knowledge and tools to fight it: vaccines, medicines, and informed policies.” In particular, Locsin acknowledged the COVAX facility, “without which, the Philippines’ COVID vaccination program would still be languishing.” In addition to the COVAX vaccines, Gonzalez reported that through some 150 different initiatives of the UN Country Team in the Philippines, by the end of 2020, more than 5 million at risk individuals were able to access essential health services, and more than 6 million boys and girls were supported with distance learning. Equally, Locsin lauded the “milestone initiative of the Philippines-United Nations Joint Programme on collaboration in human rights between the UN and a government.” “I thank UN Resident Coordinator and my good friend Gustavo Gonzalez. Under his leadership the UN Country Team has become our most reliable partner in sustainable development, in fighting climate change and upholding human rights. He embodies the “inclusive multilateralism” declared by President Duterte as the only multilateralism that “can deliver the global public goods we need.” On 22 July 2021, the Philippines and the UN signed the UN Joint Programme on Human Rights. The three-year UN joint programme was developed to implement Human Rights Council (HRC) resolution 45/33, adopted on 7 October 2020, which outlined specific areas for capacity-building and technical cooperation for the promotion and protection of human rights in the Philippines. The joint programme document was signed by Department of Justice (DOJ) Secretary Menardo Guevarra, Locsin and Gonzalez, with the late Jose Luis Gascon of the Commission on Human Rights in attendance. Aside from the DoJ, the UN joint programme is being co-implemented by the Presidential Human Rights Committee Secretariat (PHRCS), the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG), the Philippine National Police (PNP), the Dangerous Drugs Board (DDB), the Department of Health (DOH), the Anti-Terrorism Council-Program Management Center (ATC-PMC), the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) and the Commission on Human Rights (CHR).

Looking ahead, Gonzalez said that the UN in the Philippines will support the Philippines to finance efforts to build forward better from COVID-19. “We have set one priority with the government for the coming year which is to help set up a diversified financing framework that will leverage additional resources for COVID-19 recovery and getting SDGs back on track.” “Ultimately the success of the United Nations team must be measured in the difference we make in people’s lives….

"Vax on, vax off: Leaked email suggests Aus Open will allow unvaccinated stars, sparks row between Azarenka & journalist",https://www.rt.com/sport/538368-australian-open-vaccination-plan/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=RSS,,['RT'],,Unvaccinated tennis stars could be set to compete at January's Australian Open after an email sent to WTA players which seems to contradict local Covid-19 public health restrictions was leaked to the media. Read Full Article at RT.com,"Unvaccinated tennis stars could be set to compete at January's Australian Open after an email sent to WTA players which seems to contradict local Covid-19 public health restrictions was leaked to the media. Victoria, the Australian state which will host the tournament early next year, has recently introduced a vaccine mandate for all professional athletes seeking to compete within its borders – however, the email leaked online by tennis reporter Ben Rothenberg suggests that unvaccinated players will be allowed to participate if certain conditions are followed, such as quarantining for 14 days upon arrival into the country.  It had previously been though that a host of high-profile vaccine holdouts in the sport would be ineligible to compete unless they received a full dose of one of the several available vaccines. Also on rt.com ‘I will not reveal my status’: Djokovic claims it would be ‘inappropriate’ to declare whether he is vaccinated as visa issue looms World number one Novak Djokovic is thought to fall under this category after recently refusing to state whether or not he had received an inoculation against the virus. Djokovic has won an incredible nine Australian Open titles, including the last three in a row, and another win in the first Grand Slam of 2022 would separate the Serb from a pack which also includes Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal as the player with the most Grand Slam titles in history.  🐨Update on #AusOpen🐨Per email sent to WTA players just now, Tennis Australia has told WTA PC that fully vaccinated players won’t be required to quarantine or bubble at all.Unvaccinated players will be allowed to enter, TA tells WTA, but must do 14 days of hotel quarantine. pic.twitter.com/cu4NV8abYB— Ben Rothenberg (@BenRothenberg) October 24, 2021 Per the email published to social media by Rothenberg, players who remain unvaccinated ""must submit to regular testing"". By contrast, players who are fully vaccinated ""will have complete freedom of movement"" – but when pressed for comment, Victorian Sports and Major Events Minister Martin Pakula appeared to suggest that plan was not yet set in stone. ""We are still resolving with Tennis Australia and the Commonwealth whether unvaccinated foreign nationals will be allowed into Australia at all, and if so, under what circumstances they will be allowed,"" he said. ""Unvaccinated, we are still talking to the Commonwealth about whether the rule for international unvaccinated arrivals is either 14 days quarantine, or they are not coming into the country at all. We don’t expect that to be settled for another couple of weeks. ""In the end, it’s a federal decision about who gets into the country and the circumstances in which they get in. We are still having that conversation with them. And we’re obviously talking to Tennis Australia who is also talking to the Commonwealth. ""We’ll get all that sorted in plenty of time for every player on the tour to be very clear about what the rules will be. The one thing that we have assured them all, is that the vaccinated players will be treated the same way as any other vaccinated entrant to the country."" The potential change of tack – which as of now remains unconfirmed – would appear to be in reaction to last year's iteration of the Australian Open during which several players complained about the conditions in their mandatory hotel quarantine, as well problems in readying themselves for competition under such circumstances. This has led to questions as to whether players who were forced into quarantine last January would be open to doing so again early next year. The situation is further muddied by conflicting statements from Australian authorities. Victorian premier Daniel Andrews on Sunday doubled down on government advice, saying ""if you’re not vaccinated, you’re not getting in"" – while as recently as last Wednesday the immigration minister Alex Hawke noted that it was unlikely that tennis players would be given vaccine exemptions.  The fact that this was shared to players confidentially and within 2 hours Ben you are posting this.

Former world number one Victoria Azarenka took to social media to hit out at Rothenberg for publishing the leaked email online. ""The fact that this was shared to players confidentially and within 2 hours Ben you are posting this. You clearly haven’t read the email. Unless I missed the point that you are a WTA player now?"" wrote Azarenka, to which Rothenberg shot back: ""Vika, this is my job.

It had previously been though that a host of high-profile vaccine holdouts in the sport would be ineligible to compete unless they received a full dose of one of the several available vaccines. World number one Novak Djokovic is thought to fall under this category after recently refusing to state whether or not he had received an inoculation against the virus. Djokovic has won an incredible nine Australian Open titles, including the last three in a row, and another win in the first Grand Slam of 2022 would separate the Serb from a pack which also includes Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal as the player with the most Grand Slam titles in history. 🐨Update on #AusOpen 🐨Per email sent to WTA players just now, Tennis Australia has told WTA PC that fully vaccinated players won’t be required to quarantine or bubble at all.Unvaccinated players will be allowed to enter, TA tells WTA, but must do 14 days of hotel quarantine. pic.twitter.com/cu4NV8abYB Per the email published to social media by Rothenberg, players who remain unvaccinated "" must submit to regular testing "". By contrast, players who are fully vaccinated "" will have complete freedom of movement "" – but when pressed for comment, Victorian Sports and Major Events Minister Martin Pakula appeared to suggest that plan was not yet set in stone. "" We are still resolving with Tennis Australia and the Commonwealth whether unvaccinated foreign nationals will be allowed into Australia at all, and if so, under what circumstances they will be allowed ,"" he said. "" Unvaccinated, we are still talking to the Commonwealth about whether the rule for international unvaccinated arrivals is either 14 days quarantine, or they are not coming into the country at all. We don’t expect that to be settled for another couple of weeks. "" In the end, it’s a federal decision about who gets into the country and the circumstances in which they get in. We are still having that conversation with them. And we’re obviously talking to Tennis Australia who is also talking to the Commonwealth. "" We’ll get all that sorted in plenty of time for every player on the tour to be very clear about what the rules will be. The one thing that we have assured them all, is that the vaccinated players will be treated the same way as any other vaccinated entrant to the country ."" A post shared by Novak Djokovic (@djokernole) The potential change of tack – which as of now remains unconfirmed – would appear to be in reaction to last year's iteration of the Australian Open during which several players complained about the conditions in their mandatory hotel quarantine, as well problems in readying themselves for competition under such circumstances. This has led to questions as to whether players who were forced into quarantine last January would be open to doing so again early next year. The situation is further muddied by conflicting statements from Australian authorities. Victorian premier Daniel Andrews on Sunday doubled down on government advice, saying "" if you’re not vaccinated, you’re not getting in "" – while as recently as last Wednesday the immigration minister Alex Hawke noted that it was unlikely that tennis players would be given vaccine exemptions. The fact that this was shared to players confidentially and within 2 hours Ben you are posting this. You clearly haven’t read the email.

Former world number one Victoria Azarenka took to social media to hit out at Rothenberg for publishing the leaked email online. "" The fact that this was shared to players confidentially and within 2 hours Ben you are posting this. You clearly haven’t read the email. Unless I missed the point that you are a WTA player now?

Notching another win Most COVID vaccines currently available in the U.S. are administered in two doses given about a month apart. Johnson & Johnson's vaccine, Ad26.COV2.S, is administered in only one dose. Based on real-world data and a phase 3 clinical trial, the company believes a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S is 75% effective against severe cases of COVID at least 28 days post-vaccination. This efficacy compares unfavorably to that offered by the vaccines marketed by Pfizer and Moderna, and the one developed by Novavax, which has yet to earn Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in the U.S. All three proved at least 90% effective at preventing COVID in clinical studies. Image source: Getty Images. However, Johnson & Johnson recently released data showing that a booster dose (or a second dose) of its vaccine given two months after the first helps increase its efficacy to 94% against critical COVID illness. On Oct. 5, the company applied for an EUA to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a booster dose of its vaccine. Then, on Oct. 15, a panel of experts convened by the FDA unanimously voted in favor of the agency granting the company an EUA. On Oct. 20, the FDA granted the company this much-anticipated authorization. What does this mean for investors? Besides earning the regulatory green light a bit later than some of its competitors, Johnson & Johnson's COVID vaccine has encountered its share of headwinds. In mid-April, health authorities decided to pause the rollout of the vaccine after it was suspected of causing blood clots in some patients (it had originally earned an EUA in late February). Regulators lifted this pause roughly a week and a half later, arguing that the known benefits outweigh the known risks, and required a new label warning on the vaccine moving forward. Indeed, this adverse event was known to have affected six patients out of more than 6.8 million who had been vaccinated. This episode is in the rearview mirror now, and with the pandemic still not over, mainly due to the more-contagious delta variant of the virus, there is still a need for vaccines. Since a second dose of Ad26.COV2.S seems to boost its efficacy, that can only be good for its sales. That's especially the case given that the FDA did not put any health-related (or similar) restrictions on who can receive a booster dose of Johnson & Johnson's vaccine. But here's the catch: The company vowed not to profit from this product for the duration of the pandemic. In other words, increased sales of Ad26.COV2.S in the near term will have no meaningful impact on its bottom line. In the future, the company may profit from Ad26.COV2.S once the pandemic subsides and if COVID becomes a seasonal disease like the flu, as some have predicted . But even then, considering how competitive this market is, Ad26.COV2.S will only have a very modest impact on a company that typically generates more than $10 billion in profit every year. In other words, it is not the best idea to invest in Johnson & Johnson because of its COVID vaccine. Fortunately, there are plenty of other reasons to do so. Consider the company's diversified operations. Its pharmaceutical business, the largest by revenue, includes quite a few blockbuster products that continue to grow their sales. To pick a couple out of the bunch, the immunosuppressant Stelara racked up $2.4 billion in revenue in the third quarter (ending Sept. 30), 22.2% higher than the prior-year quarter. Cancer medicine Darzalex grew its sales by 43.7% year over year to $1.6 billion. Those are just the tip of the iceberg for the company, and it has several dozen programs in its late-stage pipeline. Label expansions and new drug approvals are routine for Johnson & Johnson. And its consumer health segment sells over-the-counter products with strong name recognition, including Listerine, Neutrogena, Aveeno, and Tylenol. The company's medical devices business adds to its revenue base. Here's one more reason to invest in the company: It has raised its dividend annually for more than 50 consecutive years, making it a Dividend King . It currently offers a yield of 2.53%, higher than the S&P 500 's 1.38%, and it's maintained a conservative cash payout ratio of 47%. That makes it an attractive option for income-seeking investors. In short, Johnson & Johnson may not be the best COVID vaccine stock to buy, but it remains a solid pharma company to invest in.",,fool,True,"[('Johnson & Johnson', 'ORG'), ('NYSE', 'ORG'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('billions of dollars', 'MONEY'), ('This year', 'DATE'), ('Johnson & Johnson', 'ORG'), ('$2.5 billion', 'MONEY'), ('COVID-19', 'PRODUCT'), ('$33.5 billion', 'MONEY'), ('$20 billion', 'MONEY'), ('Pfizer', 'PERSON'), ('Moderna', 'PERSON'), (""Johnson & Johnson's"", 'ORG'), ('U.S.', 'GPE'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('about a month', 'DATE'), (""Johnson & Johnson's"", 'ORG'), ('only one', 'CARDINAL'), ('3', 'CARDINAL'), ('75%', 'PERCENT'), ('COVID', 'PERSON'), ('at least 28 days', 'DATE')]"

GEORGE TOWN, Oct 25 — The International Congress and Convention Association (ICCA) Asia Pacific chapter has proposed that the Malaysian government work with several countries to develop a special pass for business travellers attending international conferences.The chapter’s chairman, Ashwin Gunasekeran, said this would ease travel requirements for business travellers who needed to attend international meetings, congress or conferences for official reasons.“If some countries are to work together to come up with one pass for business travellers, it would make it easier for them to attend international conferences and events for business purposes,” he said in an interview with Malay Mail today.He said currently, some business travellers must undergo quarantine twice or more if they need to travel several countries, in addition to undergoing different Covid-19 testing procedures.The proposed business pass would make the process smoother for these travellers as it would allow them to travel to their destinations after being tested for Covid-19, he said.Malaysia could work with several countries to develop such a system, he said when adding that it would allow seamless travel for participants of international business events.Ashwin, who is also Penang Convention & Exhibition Bureau (PCEB) chief executive officer, said the meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions (MICE) industry is now picking up as countries reopen their borders.However, there was still uncertainty and lack of standardisation among countries in terms of regulations and requirements for accepting international visitors.Among others, he said this included the non-recognition of some Covid-19 vaccines or vaccination administered in certain countries.“Some countries require their own Covid-19 testing so even if the visitor has undergone a swab test prior to arriving, the visitor may have to do it again at the country he arrived at,” he said.Ashwin said this meant a multi-destination business traveller would have to be tested repeatedly in close succession or undergo lengthy quarantines for brief visits.The proposed travel visa would reduce such restrictions and promote business travel as well as MICE activity in the country, he said.",2021-10-25 10:00:19,,,malaymail,True,"[('Asia Pacific', 'LOC'), ('Ashwin Gunasekeran', 'PERSON'), ('Tropical Spice Garden', 'ORG'), ('October 25, 2021', 'DATE'), ('Sayuti Zainudin Follow', 'PERSON'), ('Instagram', 'ORG'), ('Telegram', 'ORG'), ('GEORGE TOWN', 'PERSON'), ('Oct 25', 'DATE'), ('The International Congress and Convention Association', 'ORG'), ('Asia Pacific', 'LOC'), ('Malaysian', 'NORP'), ('Ashwin Gunasekeran', 'PERSON'), ('congress', 'ORG'), ('Malay Mail', 'ORG'), ('today', 'DATE'), ('Malaysia', 'GPE'), ('Penang Convention & Exhibition Bureau', 'ORG'), ('PCEB', 'ORG'), ('Ashwin', 'PERSON')]"

He termed the project an important document on the history of Arunachal Pradesh at a meeting with the members of the core committee and sub-committee for the recognition of the State's unsung heroes, here on Saturday. The State government had in September formed a five-member core committee headed by Mein to conduct research on the contribution of various personalities of the state in the country's freedom struggle. The committee has been tasked with collecting and examining authentic documents, archives, journals, available in the libraries and other places, seeking comments of eminent personalities and others in this regard, visiting places of relevant historical interests and taking steps as deemed fit to give recognition to the unsung freedom fighters of Arunachal.

According to him, the pandemic will end when the world chooses to end it. “Twelve years since the first World Health Summit, we meet once again in the shadow of a pandemic. And we are faced once again with some very big questions: some of the same ones we were asking in 2009 that remain unanswered, and some new ones. “One of the questions I am asked most often is: when will the pandemic end? My answer is that the pandemic will end when the world chooses to end it. It’s in our hands. We have all the tools we need: effective public health tools and effective medical tools. “But the world has not used those tools well. With almost 50 thousand deaths a week, the pandemic is far from over – and that’s just the reported deaths,” Ghebreyesus said. The WHO chief noted that the target to vaccinate 40 percent of the population of every country by the end of this year is reachable if the countries and companies that control supply match their statements with actions. “The barrier is not production. The barriers are politics and profit. It’s clear what needs to happen.

And he called on the five millions Brits who haven’t yet had the vaccine at all to come forward this winter. Asked if he agrees with Boris Johnson that this Christmas will be much better than last year’s, he replied: “Yes, of course. “For all of those like me hoping and planning for a normal Christmas – I do think that’s where we’ll be – if you want that let’s keep playing our part.” Mr Javid said people should “be cautious and take sensible actions to try and prevent the spread of the virus” as winter closes in. In particular he urged people to start taking Lateral Flow Tests before going to visit elderly relatives. He also said Brits should wear masks in crowded public places and keep up basic hygiene practices like hand washing. No Plan B Mr Javid insisted the pandemic data doesn’t yet show that the Government needs to trigger Plan B. He said: “We are not at that point. Whether we get there or not, we will see. “But the best thing we can all do to try and prevent us moving to Plan B or taking any further measures is to get out there and get our vaccines.” The health secretary also said he is “leaning towards” making jabs mandatory for all NHS workers within weeks. His remarks came after NHS England’s top doctor urged Brits to get their booster jabs to save festive celebrations. Professor Stephen Powis said people must “take up the offer” of a third dose to “protect the freedom and Christmas that we have all earned”. Mr Javid said the booster rollout has “picked up substantially” in recent days as more and more people come forward. A record 800,000 jabs were administered during the final three days of last week, including 325,140 on Saturday alone. And the PM was also handed another major boost as scientists predicted Covid cases will plummet within weeks without the need for Plan B.

Ministers are under fire as daily cases topped 50,000 for the first time since lockdown ended and 223 people died in one day last week. Brits have been urged to get booster jabs to ‘protect the freedom and Christmas that we have all earned’ by the medical director of NHS England. But a model from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine suggests infections will peak in the coming weeks before nosediving over winter, The Telegraph reports. Experts predict cases could fall by 85% before Christmas in other unpublished models, it’s understood. The dramatic decline in infections ‘will happen without’ the introduction of mandatory face masks, vaccine passports and working from home measures. Sage member John Edmunds, a professor in the Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, said: ‘When we were doing the work about two weeks ago, the Health Secretary had made it very clear that the government was not planning to introduce Plan B in the near future ‘Our model was projecting that cases would start to decline some time in the autumn. ‘However, the model also suggests that cases may start to climb again in the spring, due to a combination of waning immunity and increased contacts.’ Cases in schools are believed to be driving the current coronavirus wave, but top scientists believe this will wane as children’s immunity builds. More than 50,000 daily covid cases were recorded for the first time since 17 July on Thursday (Picture: PA) However, the modelling comes as other experts caution vaccines are not enough to stop Covid. Professor Adam Finn, who is on the Joint Committee of Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), has warned against complacency amid the ‘worsening situation in the NHS’. He told Sky News: ‘The vaccines principally are very effective at stopping people from getting seriously ill. ‘They’re not so effective unfortunately at stopping infections altogether or stopping the virus from being spread about. ‘They do have an effect on that, but they’re not by themselves going to be enough at the present time to keep the spread of the virus under control. ‘And we do need to see people continuing to make efforts to avoid contact, to avoid transmission, and to do other things as well as get vaccinated if we’re going to stop this rise from going up further.’ He added: ‘Just giving more people vaccines, including people who maybe don’t actually need the vaccines yet, could actually run the risk of making things worse rather than better. ‘If you boost people before they actually need the vaccine, it is in some senses a waste of vaccine, but also it means that you are immunising them earlier and they may make a smaller response to the vaccine and that response may wear off earlier. ‘So I think the idea of just getting more doses indiscriminately into people’s arms is not really necessarily going to solve the problem.’ Health Secretary Sajid Javid is said to have set up a ‘war room’ where he is holding daily meetings on how to tackle the crisis. Labour has called for Plan B to be imposed immediately, with Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves claiming the vaccine programme is ‘stalling’. The Government is likely to introduce mandatory jabs for NHS staff to protect the vulnerable, despite warnings of legal challenges. Mr Javid said a final decision had not been taken yet ‘but it is something that I’m heading towards’. He told Times Radio: ‘We’ve been very clear and open about this, working with our friends in the NHS, and the reason for this is if you’re working in the NHS, that fantastic work you’re doing every day, you yourself are more susceptible to this virus because you’re just much more likely to come into contact with it, but also the people that you’re looking after are more vulnerable and that’s why they’re in hospital, they’ve got health needs, and this is about protecting them and protecting yourself.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.

But a model from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine suggests infections will peak soon before nosediving over winter, The Telegraph reports. Other experts say cases could fall by 85% before the festive period in other unpublished models, it’s understood. The dramatic decline in infections ‘will happen without’ the introduction of mandatory face masks, vaccine passports and working from home measures. Sage member John Edmunds, a professor in the Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, said: ‘When we were doing the work about two weeks ago, the Health Secretary had made it very clear that the government was not planning to introduce Plan B in the near future ‘Our model was projecting that cases would start to decline some time in the autumn. ‘However, the model also suggests that cases may start to climb again in the spring, due to a combination of waning immunity and increased contacts.’ Cases in schools are believed to be driving the current coronavirus wave, but top scientists believe this will wane as children’s immunity builds. However, the modelling comes as other experts caution vaccines are not enough to stop Covid. Professor Adam Finn, who is on the Joint Committee of Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), has warned against complacency amid the ‘worsening situation in the NHS’. He told Sky News: ‘The vaccines principally are very effective at stopping people from getting seriously ill. ‘They’re not so effective unfortunately at stopping infections altogether or stopping the virus from being spread about. ‘They do have an effect on that, but they’re not by themselves going to be enough at the present time to keep the spread of the virus under control. Rare nervous system disorder added to list of AstraZeneca jab side effects Austria threatens to lockdown the unvaccinated as Covid cases soar Brits 'will need three Covid jabs if they want to go on holiday next year' ‘And we do need to see people continuing to make efforts to avoid contact, to avoid transmission, and to do other things as well as get vaccinated if we’re going to stop this rise from going up further.’ He added: ‘Just giving more people vaccines, including people who maybe don’t actually need the vaccines yet, could actually run the risk of making things worse rather than better. ‘If you boost people before they actually need the vaccine, it is in some senses a waste of vaccine, but also it means that you are immunising them earlier and they may make a smaller response to the vaccine and that response may wear off earlier. ‘So I think the idea of just getting more doses indiscriminately into people’s arms is not really necessarily going to solve the problem.’ Health Secretary Sajid Javid is said to have set up a ‘war room’ where he is holding daily meetings on how to tackle the crisis. Labour has called for Plan B to be imposed immediately, with Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves claiming the vaccine programme is ‘stalling’. The Government is likely to introduce mandatory jabs for NHS staff to protect the vulnerable, despite warnings of legal challenges. Mr Javid said a final decision had not been taken yet ‘but it is something that I’m heading towards’. He told Times Radio: ‘We’ve been very clear and open about this, working with our friends in the NHS, and the reason for this is if you’re working in the NHS, that fantastic work you’re doing every day, you yourself are more susceptible to this virus because you’re just much more likely to come into contact with it, but also the people that you’re looking after are more vulnerable and that’s why they’re in hospital, they’ve got health needs, and this is about protecting them and protecting yourself.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk .

How this Oklahoma ranch is using nuclear families to upend the foster care system,https://www.deseret.com/2021/10/24/22661072/how-this-oklahoma-ranch-is-using-nuclear-families-to-upend-the-foster-care-system-peppers-ranch,,['Naomi Schaefer Riley'],,,"Photo Illustration by Alex Cochran, Deseret News Most often sibling groups are either separated or tend to languish in foster care. Peppers Ranch is changing that Desie’s eyes grow wide as she looks over the menu at Cattlemen’s Steakhouse, a popular destination with tourists, local families and even cowboys in the Stockyards area outside of Oklahoma City. The 8-year-old Desie does not get to go out for dinner often — the nine other children in her family make that logistically and financially challenging — but that does not stop this soon-to-be third grader from sharing her adventurous tastes. “I’m going to start with the shrimp cocktail,” she announces to the half of our group of 14 sitting at one table. Desie came to stay with Ashlee and Matt Terry when she was 8 days old. It was part of a “Home for the Holidays” emergency placement. Desie came to the Terrys right after Thanksgiving in 2012 while child welfare services figured out what to do with her; she never left. Desie was actually the fourth child placed with the Terrys. Their first placements were in 2011 — sisters Evie and Piper — and then their biological sister Bella a few months later. In 2014, with four daughters, three bedrooms and only one shower, they decided they did not have the space for more. Ashlee recalls: “I said that when God provided more bathrooms, we would reopen our home.” God seemed to answer their prayer when they were offered a spot at Peppers Ranch, a community in Guthrie, about 30 minutes from Oklahoma City. The ranch harnesses an old-fashioned understanding of family, neighborhood and community to solve the problems of a new generation of displaced children. Opened in 2002, with the donation of 160 acres of land, Peppers Ranch was originally a residential facility for abused and neglected boys. The donor, Hal French, a local oil and gas entrepreneur, had grown up near a boys home and often played with the children there, and wanted to create a similar opportunity for more kids. After a few years, things seemed to be going OK for the boys who came to Peppers Ranch. But their sisters were just being dropped off at a local shelter. The girls had no equivalent and, more importantly, the siblings were losing their connection to one another. Which got French and the other folks at Peppers Ranch to thinking. According to research from Casey Family Programs, “approximately two-thirds of children in foster care have a sibling in care, and yet — despite the benefits of joint sibling placements — it is estimated that more than 70% of children with siblings are separated from one or more of their siblings while in care.” Benefits of placing siblings together include lower incidence of behavioral problems and a higher chance they will both like and adapt to their foster homes and have better academic performance. But finding foster or adoptive families that have the capacity to take in sibling groups is hard. Even if parents have an extra bed in their home or are willing to take in two siblings, what are the chances they have the space (let alone the time and energy) to take in three or four? The result is that sibling groups are either separated or tend to languish in foster care for longer. And so Peppers Ranch tried something different. In 2009, after extensive studies, the leadership decided to move to a family model, offering couples who were already licensed to do foster care in Oklahoma the opportunity to move to Peppers Ranch. There they could live in one of the newly built houses, paying only a couple of hundred dollars in rent and receiving a small stipend in addition to what the state offered for foster care, if they were willing to open their home to at least five foster children. Today, there are 16 homes on the property (with plans to build a few more over the next few years), all more than 3,000 square feet. The typical home has four bedrooms, a large living area and an industrial-size kitchen and pantry. The more recent homes even have hookups for two washers and dryers as well as larger garages in which families can park their super-size vans. The entire community has an annual budget of about $1.5 million, all from private donations. In addition to money, locals also donate furniture, clothing and other necessities. Hundreds of volunteers help maintain the grounds and run programs for the kids. Spark Creative One of the homes Peppers Ranch provides to its foster families. Set amid farmlands at the end of a dirt road which is prone to flooding, the community may seem inconvenient to some, but for the families at Peppers Ranch, it offers everything they need. The landscape feels a little sparse — not enough time has passed for many trees to mature on the land. Each family has a backyard, equipped with all the trampolines and play structures you would find in a typical suburban neighborhood. There is also a community basketball court and soccer field, a playground and pool complex, a pond where the kids can fish, and a barn with 17 horses. The horses, many of which are older and have been donated in their retirement, are used for equestrian therapy. They are gentle and the kids enjoy helping to care for them. Indeed, one of the Peppers Ranch mothers told me how excited her 6-year-old adoptive son was when he was given his very own pooper scooper for the horses. “They need my help,” he would tell his mother before running over to the barn. Each family also has to help with chores around the community — including feeding the horses over a weekend when the trainer is not around. The logistics of being a foster parent, especially with multiple children in the home, can be overwhelming. Multiple therapy appointments a week, in addition to arranging visitation with biological parents, meetings with social workers and court dates can make even the most organized person’s head spin. But Peppers Ranch brings at least some of those services to the community. There is a learning center where children can receive after-school tutoring. The ranch also offers art therapy, dance therapy, a swim team and a variety of other extracurricular activities. Parents pay a small fee for these out of the stipends they receive. The community requires at least one parent to work full time. But the subsidized housing at Peppers Ranch means one parent can stay home full time — and most of the time they do. With so many kids, especially ones who have behavioral and emotional challenges, it is hard to outsource child care. But the state stipends do not allow a typical middle-class foster family to give up one income. In families with older kids, mothers sometimes have part-time jobs they can do from home during school hours. Mostly it’s the mothers at home but in at least one case it’s the father who cares for the children while the mother works as a hospital nurse. Whoever stays home, the arrangement is a relief for parents. Dustin Burpo, a family pastor at a nearby church and a parent at Peppers Ranch, tells me that he and his wife recently looked at their budget. “We’ve got a house to stay in, a nice house that has plenty of space for our large capacity living” — the Burpos have eight children — “It truly gives you that peace of mind. It’s a weight off my shoulders, knowing that I’ve got a place for my kids.” But it’s not just the homes. It’s the community. Most of the families give their kids freedom to roam. Matt Terry says that’s one of the things he likes about Peppers Ranch, that it feels like a more old-fashioned neighborhood. It’s certainly true that it’s small enough for everyone to know everyone else. Shelly Blankenship, who has been at Peppers Ranch since 2011 and fostered around 80 children here, compares it to when she grew up across the street from her grandmother and down the street from her aunt. “You couldn’t get away with anything.” When she sees kids misbehaving at Peppers Ranch, she will say, “I don’t think you need to be doing that.” They will ask if she is going to tell their mother. Her response? “Do I need to tell her? If you’re going to quit and act right, then I don’t have to tell her anything. We’ve already taken care of it.” Even if they lived in such a neighborhood today, though, parents of foster children and children adopted out of foster care often have a much more difficult calculation about giving their children freedom. Should you let a kid wander around a neighborhood knowing that they have been traumatized by other adults? Are there psychological and behavioral problems that could pop up if something scares them or surprises them? How will other adults respond? Will their fellow parents blame them if something goes wrong? And this is really the genius of Peppers Ranch. It is a supportive community filled with other children who have gone through similar things and other adults who are trying to help those children. While many of the families at Peppers Ranch have found some level of support for their foster care efforts among friends and family, they often felt isolated before they came here. “You have behaviors for a child and you think that something is wrong with me as a parent,” says Kristin Burpo, Dustin’s wife. “You just feel judged, even in a church community,” she tells me. At Peppers Ranch, veteran parents often serve as mentors to the newer ones. The mothers meet at least once a month to talk about the issues that they are facing with their children, where to find resources to help, how to deal with the emotional toll that fostering is taking on them, their marriages, and even their other children. Most research shows that about half of all foster parents quit within their first year. Kristin Martinez understands why. Martinez, who has one biological child and seven adopted children, remembers the day she took in a 16-year-old girl. “I never had a teenager before. I could immediately go to other neighbors and they were able to provide me with great information and great resources.” Her children are playing in the backyard when I arrive, but then come in and sit down with us, periodically asking when it will be time to go get snow cones. She also describes the other trials of being a foster parent, including the “heartbreak” of having a child leave after a long time to go back to their biological family. She asks me to imagine having a child live with you for a year or more, having him or her become part of your children’s lives and then never seeing them again. Or what about “when you’re going through the heartbreak of going to all the court dates”? Martinez recalls “the heartbreak of the biological parents never getting it together. Witnessing the heartbreak that happens to your child. It’s a very emotional roller coaster, this life.” A couple of her older kids nod in agreement. She finds it reassuring that “there’s somebody here to understand that. When you’re having a really hard day and you’re in tears because it’s so hard,” she says, it means so much to her “to have people that literally understand exactly what you’re going through. … To have people that you can do this life with is pretty special.” There is also a network of support for children who live at Peppers Ranch and did not come from foster care. Few people can understand the journey of biological children whose parents keep bringing new children into the home. As Shelly Blankenship acknowledges, “My kids weren’t from trauma, but I put trauma in their lives.” But being at Peppers Ranch has helped her children process that. Rather than putting all this emotional chaos behind her, her daughter, who is now 25, has guardianship over a 17-year-old in the system. Kristin Burpo appreciates that her children see “unconditional love” in her home and in the other homes at Peppers Ranch. “This is always my prayer, that they would see my heart in all of it. And no matter the child that comes in my home, they’re my child when they’re in my home.” Memory McElhaney The Burpo family enjoys some time on the beach. During COVID-19, the community created its own bubble. The kids would still play with each other, going on field trips to state parks some days. The moms would get together, pick up some food and sit in one of their vans to get a break from the kids. “We did that once a week just to try to keep our sanity,” Kristin recalls. The Burpos had two biological children when they took in Shanaya, their first foster child from a family that her husband’s brother (a pastor) knew from his church. Even in a community that was welcoming, she worried that their children might stick out. “Our daughter is black and we are white. It was a little bit awkward” in the small town they lived in before Peppers Ranch. “Coming out here, we know that Shanaya would grow up not feeling odd. Coming to a community where everybody was accepted the way they were because it was just normal. … That was really big for us.” Since moving to Peppers Ranch, they have adopted two sets of siblings: Shakota, 8, Sky, 7, and Trinity, 6; and JC, 4, and Keisha, 3. When I visit their house the chaos is controlled. Kristin is folding laundry. The older kids have helped the younger kids get their sandwiches for lunch and they are passing around the largest container of cheese balls I have ever seen. Three of the younger kids go to watch cartoons when they are done. The family has just come back from a vacation Bible school camp and they are trying to get back into a routine. Dustin, their father, is a pastor at a church about 40 minutes away. Peppers Ranch is not a faith-based organization but every one of the families there is guided in some way by their religious beliefs. Ashley Hahn, the director of the ranch, says they have all “felt called through faith to this walk.” She tells me, “I’m a person of faith. I don’t know how you could do it without knowing the Lord is on your side.” Most of the Burpo kids ignore me, but one of the girls takes me on a grand tour of the house, showing me what’s inside of each of the closets, introducing me to the cat. She seems to crave attention in a way that would be typical for an outgoing 7-year-old. And she clearly enjoys showing off for guests. But then she starts taking watermelon rinds out of the garbage and chewing on them. When Dustin notices, he is calm but firm, asking her to stop. After she does it again, he takes her aside, offering a sterner but still completely calm warning. The kids, as Kristin explains to me over the third basket of laundry, have all manner of diagnoses. A number were born with drugs in their systems. Others watched their parents physically abuse each other and experienced severe neglect as they were shuttled back and forth among parents too strung out to care for them and grandparents who were overwhelmed. Providing a stable environment with love and clear boundaries is important, but the Burpos have tried to consider in other ways how they parent. Almost everyone at Peppers Ranch has been through training in how to deal with kids who have experienced trauma. Dustin also says he talks to other fathers at the ranch about their unique role. Many of the kids have no responsible adult male in their lives. “We are fathers to the fatherless.” Dustin, who counts himself lucky for growing up with a father and a stepfather, says he fears for these kids, many of whom “don’t know who their biological father is and they probably never will know. I get to fill that role. And it’s very humbling and scary at the same time.” Peppers Ranch families think about the building blocks of a normal family and how to re-create them for kids who have come out of dysfunctional homes. Kristin has seen up close how vital it is for sibling groups to stay together. It’s difficult for younger kids because they want to have at least one of the older people they look up to present in their lives. But “when it’s an older child taking care of a younger child and then they are split, … the older child was the caretaker and then they have no purpose.” Ashlee and Matt met doing a training offered by the Oklahoma Department of Health Services. She was training to be a caseworker, helping foster children find permanency. He was training to be a child abuse investigator. It wasn’t long before they were married and began taking in foster children themselves. Matt says that Ashlee is the one in charge of all the logistics of the family and making sure everything works, but it’s clear that his experience working with this population of children has driven him here as well. In his first few months on the job, he discovered three dead children. It was during the rise of meth labs in the area a few years ago. “We didn’t know what we were stepping into.” At dinner with the Terry family at Cattlemen’s, the dynamics of the siblings seems both happy and familiar. Their oldest son, Jose, who is 18 and just finished high school, took his younger brother to the bathroom more than once during dinner and helped him order food. In addition to Dessie, the Terrys have adopted one set of three sisters and another set of five brothers and sisters and are fostering the nephew of the five, born to an older sister who is an adult. Jose is living at home while he is enrolled in local vocational training program. He says he wants to become and electrician and move to Las Vegas. Ashlee, who took him to Vegas for his 18th birthday and celebrated with him by getting tattoos together, jokes that with all those lights there should plenty for him to do. His next youngest sister listens excitedly and talks about her plans for the future, too. She has multiple babysitting jobs and likes caring for children but is also thinking about cosmetology. When we sit down, the kids divide themselves more by age than by their families of origin. But the fact that they are with the people they grew up with seems to set them at ease. Certainly dinner with 10 kids turns out to be much more serene than you might expect. Despite having to wait over an hour for a table — by which point my own children would be losing their minds — these children were patient and kind, asking their parents polite questions and making conversation with me and DaNysha Wright, the programs and outreach director for Peppers Ranch. When 17-year-old Aurelia asks DaNysha whether she would ever foster or adopt herself, she looks around the table smiling. Desie takes advantage of her moment of hesitation to explain, “I think you need to find a man first!” In some ways, Peppers Ranch has a sort of artificial feel. The current families have to meet with potential new families and decide whether they should be able to move in. Families can only stay in the community as long as their homes are open to foster children, even if only on a temporary basis. A number of families have ended their foster care “journeys” after a few years and children from other homes talk about missing their friends. Of course, this could happen in any neighborhood. Ashlee Terry Children play on the property of Peppers Ranch. Peppers Ranch does try to provide continuity for kids in other ways. They have a “Grandma” program, in which older people who have either moved on from fostering or who simply want to help out, can live in one of a few small apartments in the community. They form their own relationships with the kids, inviting them over to bake cookies or help with homework. They host playdates for the little ones to give the moms a break and organize art projects for the older kids. One of the new grandmas, Kim Magallanes, moved here from California after her son and daughter-in-law came a few years ago. She is retired but filled with energy and has started to build relationships with the kids. She also has experience with horses and plans to help out in the barn as well. She keeps a stash of carrots in her refrigerator in case one of the kids comes by and wants to go feed them. Kim remembers when she was a child “going to my grandparents’ house, things that I now realize were chores, were fun. Hanging clothes on the line and picking berries and learning how to bake.” Being a grandmother at Peppers Ranch is “just being another person these kids can hang out with.” She’s taking a group of the teenagers on a trip to a camp a few hours away a couple of days after we meet. Other communities have attempted to harness the power and time of an older generation to build connections with foster children. In an article called “It Takes a Multigenerational Village to Raise Foster Kids” the authors who work at an organization called Hope Meadows describe how they have created communities in which foster families live in close proximity to older adults. The programs, which are funded in part with public dollars, offer “intergenerational art and other classes, weekly community dinners, and a community garden, where young and older residents can meet and strengthen ties.” Indeed, such communities are part of a larger conversation we seem to be having in this country about the need for more communal support to raise all children. Last year, David Brooks penned an article for The Atlantic arguing that the nuclear family had failed us. He bemoaned the loss of extended families and tightly-connected neighborhoods, suggesting that “forged families” are the future, people who may not be related by blood, but have chosen to live in community. A New Yorker article on communal living among adults focuses on arrangements like Treehouse Hollywood, which author Nathan Heller describes as “a space for community living, where people of many ages and from many walks of life eat together, spend time together, and conduct their lives largely in common view.” At least one young single mother who was interviewed says she found support for her child rearing with the other adults there. As Brooks writes: “Americans are hungering to live in extended and forged families, in ways that are new and ancient at the same time. This is a significant opportunity, a chance to thicken and broaden family relationships, a chance to allow more adults and children to live and grow under the loving gaze of a dozen pairs of eyes, and be caught, when they fall, by a dozen pairs of arms.” There are certainly a dozen arms waiting to catch the kids at Peppers Ranch, but they are primarily being cared for by nuclear families. Each couple makes decisions about bringing children into their family — each contracts with the state of Oklahoma separately to care for these kids. They have different rules for their children make different decisions about where to send their children to school and how much to involve themselves with other families in the community. They take different vacations and attend different camps. Each couple is guided by their own faith and attend a variety of churches. These children have often come from environments where there were a dozen pairs of arms — parents, grandmothers, aunts, neighbors — but none of them were responsible or capable enough to be the children’s primary caretakers, which is how they ended up in foster care in the first place. Peppers Ranch is built on a different notion — that children need two parents, including in most cases one who works and one who is at home, and the presence of their biological siblings if possible. These family units can certainly stand to benefit from the support of others in the community — the grandmothers, the other fathers and mothers in the same position, the counselors and therapists and learning specialists — but the family is the thing. Naomi Schaefer Riley is a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a Deseret News contributor and the author of “No Way to Treat a Child: How the Foster Care System, Family Courts, and Racial Activists Are Wrecking Young Lives.”",2021-10-25 04:24:04,"Desie’s eyes grow wide as she looks over the menu at Cattlemen’s Steakhouse, a popular destination with tourists, local families and even cowboys in the Stockyards area outside of Oklahoma City.

According to research from Casey Family Programs, “approximately two-thirds of children in foster care have a sibling in care, and yet — despite the benefits of joint sibling placements — it is estimated that more than 70% of children with siblings are separated from one or more of their siblings while in care.” Benefits of placing siblings together include lower incidence of behavioral problems and a higher chance they will both like and adapt to their foster homes and have better academic performance. Related She outgrew foster care, but the hardship didn’t stop there But finding foster or adoptive families that have the capacity to take in sibling groups is hard. Even if parents have an extra bed in their home or are willing to take in two siblings, what are the chances they have the space (let alone the time and energy) to take in three or four? The result is that sibling groups are either separated or tend to languish in foster care for longer. And so Peppers Ranch tried something different. In 2009, after extensive studies, the leadership decided to move to a family model, offering couples who were already licensed to do foster care in Oklahoma the opportunity to move to Peppers Ranch. There they could live in one of the newly built houses, paying only a couple of hundred dollars in rent and receiving a small stipend in addition to what the state offered for foster care, if they were willing to open their home to at least five foster children. Today, there are 16 homes on the property (with plans to build a few more over the next few years), all more than 3,000 square feet. The typical home has four bedrooms, a large living area and an industrial-size kitchen and pantry. The more recent homes even have hookups for two washers and dryers as well as larger garages in which families can park their super-size vans. The entire community has an annual budget of about $1.5 million, all from private donations. In addition to money, locals also donate furniture, clothing and other necessities. Hundreds of volunteers help maintain the grounds and run programs for the kids. One of the homes Peppers Ranch provides to its foster families. Spark Creative Set amid farmlands at the end of a dirt road which is prone to flooding, the community may seem inconvenient to some, but for the families at Peppers Ranch, it offers everything they need. The landscape feels a little sparse — not enough time has passed for many trees to mature on the land. Each family has a backyard, equipped with all the trampolines and play structures you would find in a typical suburban neighborhood. There is also a community basketball court and soccer field, a playground and pool complex, a pond where the kids can fish, and a barn with 17 horses. The horses, many of which are older and have been donated in their retirement, are used for equestrian therapy. They are gentle and the kids enjoy helping to care for them. Indeed, one of the Peppers Ranch mothers told me how excited her 6-year-old adoptive son was when he was given his very own pooper scooper for the horses. “They need my help,” he would tell his mother before running over to the barn. Each family also has to help with chores around the community — including feeding the horses over a weekend when the trainer is not around. The logistics of being a foster parent, especially with multiple children in the home, can be overwhelming. Multiple therapy appointments a week, in addition to arranging visitation with biological parents, meetings with social workers and court dates can make even the most organized person’s head spin. But Peppers Ranch brings at least some of those services to the community. There is a learning center where children can receive after-school tutoring. The ranch also offers art therapy, dance therapy, a swim team and a variety of other extracurricular activities. Parents pay a small fee for these out of the stipends they receive. The community requires at least one parent to work full time. But the subsidized housing at Peppers Ranch means one parent can stay home full time — and most of the time they do. With so many kids, especially ones who have behavioral and emotional challenges, it is hard to outsource child care. But the state stipends do not allow a typical middle-class foster family to give up one income. In families with older kids, mothers sometimes have part-time jobs they can do from home during school hours. Mostly it’s the mothers at home but in at least one case it’s the father who cares for the children while the mother works as a hospital nurse. Whoever stays home, the arrangement is a relief for parents. Dustin Burpo, a family pastor at a nearby church and a parent at Peppers Ranch, tells me that he and his wife recently looked at their budget. “We’ve got a house to stay in, a nice house that has plenty of space for our large capacity living” — the Burpos have eight children — “It truly gives you that peace of mind. It’s a weight off my shoulders, knowing that I’ve got a place for my kids.” But it’s not just the homes. It’s the community. Most of the families give their kids freedom to roam. Matt Terry says that’s one of the things he likes about Peppers Ranch, that it feels like a more old-fashioned neighborhood. It’s certainly true that it’s small enough for everyone to know everyone else. Shelly Blankenship, who has been at Peppers Ranch since 2011 and fostered around 80 children here, compares it to when she grew up across the street from her grandmother and down the street from her aunt. “You couldn’t get away with anything.” When she sees kids misbehaving at Peppers Ranch, she will say, “I don’t think you need to be doing that.” They will ask if she is going to tell their mother. Her response? “Do I need to tell her? If you’re going to quit and act right, then I don’t have to tell her anything. We’ve already taken care of it.” Even if they lived in such a neighborhood today, though, parents of foster children and children adopted out of foster care often have a much more difficult calculation about giving their children freedom. Should you let a kid wander around a neighborhood knowing that they have been traumatized by other adults? Are there psychological and behavioral problems that could pop up if something scares them or surprises them? How will other adults respond? Will their fellow parents blame them if something goes wrong? Related Opinion: Religious foster care plays a vital role for our most vulnerable children And this is really the genius of Peppers Ranch. It is a supportive community filled with other children who have gone through similar things and other adults who are trying to help those children. While many of the families at Peppers Ranch have found some level of support for their foster care efforts among friends and family, they often felt isolated before they came here. “You have behaviors for a child and you think that something is wrong with me as a parent,” says Kristin Burpo, Dustin’s wife. “You just feel judged, even in a church community,” she tells me. At Peppers Ranch, veteran parents often serve as mentors to the newer ones. The mothers meet at least once a month to talk about the issues that they are facing with their children, where to find resources to help, how to deal with the emotional toll that fostering is taking on them, their marriages, and even their other children. Most research shows that about half of all foster parents quit within their first year. Kristin Martinez understands why. Martinez, who has one biological child and seven adopted children, remembers the day she took in a 16-year-old girl. “I never had a teenager before. I could immediately go to other neighbors and they were able to provide me with great information and great resources.” Her children are playing in the backyard when I arrive, but then come in and sit down with us, periodically asking when it will be time to go get snow cones. She also describes the other trials of being a foster parent, including the “heartbreak” of having a child leave after a long time to go back to their biological family. She asks me to imagine having a child live with you for a year or more, having him or her become part of your children’s lives and then never seeing them again. Or what about “when you’re going through the heartbreak of going to all the court dates”? Martinez recalls “the heartbreak of the biological parents never getting it together. Witnessing the heartbreak that happens to your child. It’s a very emotional roller coaster, this life.” A couple of her older kids nod in agreement. She finds it reassuring that “there’s somebody here to understand that. When you’re having a really hard day and you’re in tears because it’s so hard,” she says, it means so much to her “to have people that literally understand exactly what you’re going through. … To have people that you can do this life with is pretty special.” There is also a network of support for children who live at Peppers Ranch and did not come from foster care. Few people can understand the journey of biological children whose parents keep bringing new children into the home. As Shelly Blankenship acknowledges, “My kids weren’t from trauma, but I put trauma in their lives.” But being at Peppers Ranch has helped her children process that. Rather than putting all this emotional chaos behind her, her daughter, who is now 25, has guardianship over a 17-year-old in the system. Kristin Burpo appreciates that her children see “unconditional love” in her home and in the other homes at Peppers Ranch. “This is always my prayer, that they would see my heart in all of it. And no matter the child that comes in my home, they’re my child when they’re in my home.” The Burpo family enjoys some time on the beach. Memory McElhaney During COVID-19, the community created its own bubble. The kids would still play with each other, going on field trips to state parks some days. The moms would get together, pick up some food and sit in one of their vans to get a break from the kids. “We did that once a week just to try to keep our sanity,” Kristin recalls. The Burpos had two biological children when they took in Shanaya, their first foster child from a family that her husband’s brother (a pastor) knew from his church. Even in a community that was welcoming, she worried that their children might stick out. “Our daughter is black and we are white. It was a little bit awkward” in the small town they lived in before Peppers Ranch. “Coming out here, we know that Shanaya would grow up not feeling odd. Coming to a community where everybody was accepted the way they were because it was just normal. … That was really big for us.” Since moving to Peppers Ranch, they have adopted two sets of siblings: Shakota, 8, Sky, 7, and Trinity, 6; and JC, 4, and Keisha, 3. When I visit their house the chaos is controlled. Kristin is folding laundry. The older kids have helped the younger kids get their sandwiches for lunch and they are passing around the largest container of cheese balls I have ever seen. Three of the younger kids go to watch cartoons when they are done. The family has just come back from a vacation Bible school camp and they are trying to get back into a routine. Dustin, their father, is a pastor at a church about 40 minutes away. Peppers Ranch is not a faith-based organization but every one of the families there is guided in some way by their religious beliefs. Ashley Hahn, the director of the ranch, says they have all “felt called through faith to this walk.” She tells me, “I’m a person of faith. I don’t know how you could do it without knowing the Lord is on your side.” Most of the Burpo kids ignore me, but one of the girls takes me on a grand tour of the house, showing me what’s inside of each of the closets, introducing me to the cat. She seems to crave attention in a way that would be typical for an outgoing 7-year-old. And she clearly enjoys showing off for guests. But then she starts taking watermelon rinds out of the garbage and chewing on them. When Dustin notices, he is calm but firm, asking her to stop. After she does it again, he takes her aside, offering a sterner but still completely calm warning. The kids, as Kristin explains to me over the third basket of laundry, have all manner of diagnoses. A number were born with drugs in their systems. Others watched their parents physically abuse each other and experienced severe neglect as they were shuttled back and forth among parents too strung out to care for them and grandparents who were overwhelmed. Providing a stable environment with love and clear boundaries is important, but the Burpos have tried to consider in other ways how they parent. Almost everyone at Peppers Ranch has been through training in how to deal with kids who have experienced trauma. Dustin also says he talks to other fathers at the ranch about their unique role. Many of the kids have no responsible adult male in their lives. “We are fathers to the fatherless.” Dustin, who counts himself lucky for growing up with a father and a stepfather, says he fears for these kids, many of whom “don’t know who their biological father is and they probably never will know. I get to fill that role. And it’s very humbling and scary at the same time.” Peppers Ranch families think about the building blocks of a normal family and how to re-create them for kids who have come out of dysfunctional homes. Kristin has seen up close how vital it is for sibling groups to stay together. It’s difficult for younger kids because they want to have at least one of the older people they look up to present in their lives. But “when it’s an older child taking care of a younger child and then they are split, … the older child was the caretaker and then they have no purpose.” Ashlee and Matt met doing a training offered by the Oklahoma Department of Health Services. She was training to be a caseworker, helping foster children find permanency. He was training to be a child abuse investigator. It wasn’t long before they were married and began taking in foster children themselves. Matt says that Ashlee is the one in charge of all the logistics of the family and making sure everything works, but it’s clear that his experience working with this population of children has driven him here as well. In his first few months on the job, he discovered three dead children. It was during the rise of meth labs in the area a few years ago. “We didn’t know what we were stepping into.” At dinner with the Terry family at Cattlemen’s, the dynamics of the siblings seems both happy and familiar. Their oldest son, Jose, who is 18 and just finished high school, took his younger brother to the bathroom more than once during dinner and helped him order food. In addition to Dessie, the Terrys have adopted one set of three sisters and another set of five brothers and sisters and are fostering the nephew of the five, born to an older sister who is an adult. Jose is living at home while he is enrolled in local vocational training program. He says he wants to become and electrician and move to Las Vegas. Ashlee, who took him to Vegas for his 18th birthday and celebrated with him by getting tattoos together, jokes that with all those lights there should plenty for him to do. His next youngest sister listens excitedly and talks about her plans for the future, too. She has multiple babysitting jobs and likes caring for children but is also thinking about cosmetology. When we sit down, the kids divide themselves more by age than by their families of origin. But the fact that they are with the people they grew up with seems to set them at ease. Certainly dinner with 10 kids turns out to be much more serene than you might expect. Despite having to wait over an hour for a table — by which point my own children would be losing their minds — these children were patient and kind, asking their parents polite questions and making conversation with me and DaNysha Wright, the programs and outreach director for Peppers Ranch. When 17-year-old Aurelia asks DaNysha whether she would ever foster or adopt herself, she looks around the table smiling. Desie takes advantage of her moment of hesitation to explain, “I think you need to find a man first!” In some ways, Peppers Ranch has a sort of artificial feel. The current families have to meet with potential new families and decide whether they should be able to move in. Families can only stay in the community as long as their homes are open to foster children, even if only on a temporary basis. A number of families have ended their foster care “journeys” after a few years and children from other homes talk about missing their friends. Of course, this could happen in any neighborhood. Children play on the property of Peppers Ranch. Ashlee Terry Peppers Ranch does try to provide continuity for kids in other ways. They have a “Grandma” program, in which older people who have either moved on from fostering or who simply want to help out, can live in one of a few small apartments in the community. They form their own relationships with the kids, inviting them over to bake cookies or help with homework. They host playdates for the little ones to give the moms a break and organize art projects for the older kids. One of the new grandmas, Kim Magallanes, moved here from California after her son and daughter-in-law came a few years ago. She is retired but filled with energy and has started to build relationships with the kids. She also has experience with horses and plans to help out in the barn as well. She keeps a stash of carrots in her refrigerator in case one of the kids comes by and wants to go feed them. Kim remembers when she was a child “going to my grandparents’ house, things that I now realize were chores, were fun. Hanging clothes on the line and picking berries and learning how to bake.” Being a grandmother at Peppers Ranch is “just being another person these kids can hang out with.” She’s taking a group of the teenagers on a trip to a camp a few hours away a couple of days after we meet. Other communities have attempted to harness the power and time of an older generation to build connections with foster children. In an article called “It Takes a Multigenerational Village to Raise Foster Kids” the authors who work at an organization called Hope Meadows describe how they have created communities in which foster families live in close proximity to older adults. The programs, which are funded in part with public dollars, offer “intergenerational art and other classes, weekly community dinners, and a community garden, where young and older residents can meet and strengthen ties.” Indeed, such communities are part of a larger conversation we seem to be having in this country about the need for more communal support to raise all children. Last year, David Brooks penned an article for The Atlantic arguing that the nuclear family had failed us. He bemoaned the loss of extended families and tightly-connected neighborhoods, suggesting that “forged families” are the future, people who may not be related by blood, but have chosen to live in community. A New Yorker article on communal living among adults focuses on arrangements like Treehouse Hollywood, which author Nathan Heller describes as “a space for community living, where people of many ages and from many walks of life eat together, spend time together, and conduct their lives largely in common view.” At least one young single mother who was interviewed says she found support for her child rearing with the other adults there. As Brooks writes: “Americans are hungering to live in extended and forged families, in ways that are new and ancient at the same time. This is a significant opportunity, a chance to thicken and broaden family relationships, a chance to allow more adults and children to live and grow under the loving gaze of a dozen pairs of eyes, and be caught, when they fall, by a dozen pairs of arms.” There are certainly a dozen arms waiting to catch the kids at Peppers Ranch, but they are primarily being cared for by nuclear families. Each couple makes decisions about bringing children into their family — each contracts with the state of Oklahoma separately to care for these kids. They have different rules for their children make different decisions about where to send their children to school and how much to involve themselves with other families in the community. They take different vacations and attend different camps. Each couple is guided by their own faith and attend a variety of churches. These children have often come from environments where there were a dozen pairs of arms — parents, grandmothers, aunts, neighbors — but none of them were responsible or capable enough to be the children’s primary caretakers, which is how they ended up in foster care in the first place. Peppers Ranch is built on a different notion — that children need two parents, including in most cases one who works and one who is at home, and the presence of their biological siblings if possible. These family units can certainly stand to benefit from the support of others in the community — the grandmothers, the other fathers and mothers in the same position, the counselors and therapists and learning specialists — but the family is the thing.

Most nonreligious Americans are vaccinated. But how do we reach the holdouts?,https://www.deseret.com/faith/2021/10/24/22726287/how-to-reach-the-secular-americans-who-refuse-to-get-vaccinated-pew-research-prri-covid-vaccine,,['Mya Jaradat'],,,"Illustration by Alex Cochran While those unaffiliated with a religion have a high vaccination rate, there are secular holdouts who remain hesitant or are refusers. With no centralized place to reach them, how do we help them get vaccinated? Recently, in my social circles, I’ve come across something I thought unusual: secular Americans who refuse to get vaccinated. Like many Americans, I assumed the religiously unaffiliated to be more progressive. Statistically, the less religious tend to lean left and left-leaning Americans are more likely to be vaccinated. But these unaffiliated, unvaccinated women and man defied neat categories. They offered a variety of reasons for not getting the shot, ranging from “It’s a personal decision” to “I refuse to bow to COVID.” Shane Dunlap, Pittsburgh Tribune-Review via Associated Press Are these the last — and hardest to reach — holdouts when it comes to getting the country vaccinated? According to both the Public Religion Research Institute and Pew Research Center, 75% of religiously unaffiliated Americans — who are also known as “nones” — are vaccinated. But Pew broke the data down a bit more: According to Pew, 90% of atheists are vaccinated as are 85% of agnostics. Those who described themselves as “nothing in particular” are only 69% vaccinated. The only religious group less vaccinated are white evangelicals. “The assumption about nones that they’re all a super liberal group is not necessarily accurate,” Natalie Jackson, director of research at Public Religion Research Institute, said. “It’s like any other group we put together to talk about it but they’re not a monolith.” While they are, on the whole, “more liberal than their religious counterparts on many many measures,” Jackson said, “there are some people, certainly, who are kind of formerly evangelicals or formerly conservative Christian and they’re still conservative but they’ve just kind of lopped off the Christian.” Jackson added that 14% of the religiously unaffiliated are Republicans, a group that has lower vaccination rates than Democrats. Mandate to engage While a survey conducted by Public Religion Research Institute and the Interfaith Youth Core showed that 18% of the religiously unaffiliated would be somewhat receptive to religious outreach regarding the COVID-19 vaccine, what about the other 82%? What’s the best way to get them on the vaccine train? Science, data or logic won’t be as effective, experts said, as interpersonal relationships and trust would be. That “sort of mandates” Americans to engage in personal, individualized conversations addressing these people’s concerns and feelings, Jackson said. Jackson remarked that we’re past the point where blanket statements about public health will work. Rather, ”If you’re going for persuasion it’s going to be an individual conversation that has to happen,” she said. “These are conversations that Joe Biden or (Dr. Anthony) Fauci can’t have,” said Nick Fish, president of the American Atheists organization. Such “last mile conversations are much harder and we have to get over our own unease about being willing to engage in these conversations.” Fish said it’s crucial to “meet people where they’re at.” Atheists often make the mistake of hitting other people over the head with data and science, Fish admitted. But to reach the last vaccine hesitant and refusers, we need to listen with an open heart and compassion. “The question of the individual rights thing ... is really challenging because it can come across as a value judgment,” said Fish, whose father leans conservative and was initially hesitant to get the vaccine. “But one of the ways to get at that is, ‘Yes, I agree it’s a personal choice. For you, personally, what is stopping you?’” Establishing trust Listening plays an important role in building trust and tailoring counterarguments to the individual’s concerns. “If you’re talking about individual rights, individual liberty, individual choice, you’re talking about moving through the world without fear and this is a way to do it — by taking this shot,” Fish said. “We don’t have to continue these lockdowns or these impositions on your liberty — (the vaccine) is a way out of it.” As for secular people who “don’t want to bow to COVID,” Fish said that pointing out that the vaccine is a way to beat the virus, not bow to it, could be effective. If all else fails, you can always turn to the good old fashioned guilt trip, Fish joked. That’s what worked with his father. Around the time of Fish’s birthday, Fish told his parents he wanted his father to get vaccinated so he could go visit them. It worked and his dad got the jab. But the data suggests that, when it comes to the secular hesitant or refusers, appeals from friends and family members will only go so far. Among the unaffiliated, Jackson said, “We do get 30% of them saying that a health care provider could encourage them. Friends or family is 15%.” “I think, in general, what we see with everybody is also true with unaffiliated folks. It’s about establishing trust and being that trusted messenger or providing information and listening to what their individual issues are,” Jackson reflected. “At some point every additional person who gets vaccinated requires an individual touch.” Bigger problems to solve Another aspect of meeting people where they are, experts said, is making sure they have easy access to vaccines. Fish and other experts pointed out that some of the Americans who remain unvaccinated might be doing so not by choice, but due to other obstacles that impede their access to vaccines. “We do need to reduce barriers still,” Fish said, pointing to the lack of availability of vaccines in rural areas as one example. Other impediments to getting vaccinated include an inability to take the time off of work to get the shot or to take sick days if one becomes ill in reaction to the vaccine. A lack of transportation or child care also poses obstacles. These issues point to deeper problems to be resolved, said Nicole Carr, deputy director of the American Humanist Association, such as “the importance of things like all employers being required to offer paid sick leave and reasonable time off — that make for a more equitable society, in general.”",2021-10-25 04:00:01,"Recently, in my social circles, I’ve come across something I thought unusual: secular Americans who refuse to get vaccinated.

According to both the Public Religion Research Institute and Pew Research Center , 75% of religiously unaffiliated Americans — who are also known as “nones” — are vaccinated. But Pew broke the data down a bit more: According to Pew, 90% of atheists are vaccinated as are 85% of agnostics. Those who described themselves as “nothing in particular” are only 69% vaccinated. The only religious group less vaccinated are white evangelicals. “The assumption about nones that they’re all a super liberal group is not necessarily accurate,” Natalie Jackson, director of research at Public Religion Research Institute, said. “It’s like any other group we put together to talk about it but they’re not a monolith.” While they are, on the whole, “more liberal than their religious counterparts on many many measures,” Jackson said, “there are some people, certainly, who are kind of formerly evangelicals or formerly conservative Christian and they’re still conservative but they’ve just kind of lopped off the Christian.” Jackson added that 14% of the religiously unaffiliated are Republicans, a group that has lower vaccination rates than Democrats. Mandate to engage While a survey conducted by Public Religion Research Institute and the Interfaith Youth Core showed that 18% of the religiously unaffiliated would be somewhat receptive to religious outreach regarding the COVID-19 vaccine, what about the other 82%? What’s the best way to get them on the vaccine train? Science, data or logic won’t be as effective, experts said, as interpersonal relationships and trust would be. That “sort of mandates” Americans to engage in personal, individualized conversations addressing these people’s concerns and feelings, Jackson said. Jackson remarked that we’re past the point where blanket statements about public health will work. Rather, ”If you’re going for persuasion it’s going to be an individual conversation that has to happen,” she said. “These are conversations that Joe Biden or (Dr. Anthony) Fauci can’t have,” said Nick Fish, president of the American Atheists organization. Such “last mile conversations are much harder and we have to get over our own unease about being willing to engage in these conversations.” Fish said it’s crucial to “meet people where they’re at.” Atheists often make the mistake of hitting other people over the head with data and science, Fish admitted. But to reach the last vaccine hesitant and refusers, we need to listen with an open heart and compassion. “The question of the individual rights thing ... is really challenging because it can come across as a value judgment,” said Fish, whose father leans conservative and was initially hesitant to get the vaccine. “But one of the ways to get at that is, ‘Yes, I agree it’s a personal choice. For you, personally, what is stopping you?’” Establishing trust Listening plays an important role in building trust and tailoring counterarguments to the individual’s concerns. “If you’re talking about individual rights, individual liberty, individual choice, you’re talking about moving through the world without fear and this is a way to do it — by taking this shot,” Fish said. “We don’t have to continue these lockdowns or these impositions on your liberty — (the vaccine) is a way out of it.” As for secular people who “don’t want to bow to COVID,” Fish said that pointing out that the vaccine is a way to beat the virus, not bow to it, could be effective. If all else fails, you can always turn to the good old fashioned guilt trip, Fish joked. That’s what worked with his father. Around the time of Fish’s birthday, Fish told his parents he wanted his father to get vaccinated so he could go visit them. It worked and his dad got the jab. But the data suggests that, when it comes to the secular hesitant or refusers, appeals from friends and family members will only go so far. Among the unaffiliated, Jackson said, “We do get 30% of them saying that a health care provider could encourage them. Friends or family is 15%.” “I think, in general, what we see with everybody is also true with unaffiliated folks. It’s about establishing trust and being that trusted messenger or providing information and listening to what their individual issues are,” Jackson reflected. “At some point every additional person who gets vaccinated requires an individual touch.” Bigger problems to solve Another aspect of meeting people where they are, experts said, is making sure they have easy access to vaccines. Fish and other experts pointed out that some of the Americans who remain unvaccinated might be doing so not by choice, but due to other obstacles that impede their access to vaccines. “We do need to reduce barriers still,” Fish said, pointing to the lack of availability of vaccines in rural areas as one example. Other impediments to getting vaccinated include an inability to take the time off of work to get the shot or to take sick days if one becomes ill in reaction to the vaccine. A lack of transportation or child care also poses obstacles. These issues point to deeper problems to be resolved, said Nicole Carr, deputy director of the American Humanist Association, such as “the importance of things like all employers being required to offer paid sick leave and reasonable time off — that make for a more equitable society, in general.”",,deseret,True,"[('Alex Cochran', 'PERSON'), ('Americans', 'NORP'), ('Americans', 'NORP'), ('Americans', 'NORP'), ('COVID', 'PERSON'), ('Shane Dunlap', 'PERSON'), ('Pittsburgh Tribune-Review', 'ORG'), ('Associated Press Are', 'ORG'), ('the Public Religion Research Institute', 'ORG'), ('75%', 'PERCENT'), ('Americans', 'NORP'), ('90%', 'PERCENT'), ('85%', 'PERCENT'), ('only 69%', 'PERCENT'), ('Natalie Jackson', 'PERSON'), ('Public Religion Research Institute', 'ORG'), ('Jackson', 'PERSON'), ('Christian', 'NORP'), ('Christian', 'NORP'), ('Jackson', 'PERSON'), ('14%', 'PERCENT'), ('Republicans', 'NORP'), ('Democrats', 'NORP'), ('Public Religion Research Institute', 'ORG'), ('the Interfaith Youth Core', 'ORG'), ('18%', 'PERCENT'), ('COVID-19', 'ORG'), ('the other 82%', 'PERCENT'), ('Americans', 'NORP'), ('Jackson', 'PERSON'), ('Jackson', 'PERSON'), ('Joe Biden', 'PERSON'), ('Anthony) Fauci', 'PERSON'), ('Nick Fish', 'PERSON'), ('American', 'NORP'), ('Fish', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('COVID', 'PERSON'), ('Fish', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Jackson', 'PERSON'), ('30%', 'PERCENT'), ('15%', 'PERCENT'), ('Jackson', 'PERSON'), ('Americans', 'NORP'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('sick days', 'DATE'), ('Nicole Carr', 'PERSON'), ('the American Humanist Association', 'ORG')]"

Trudeau has long sought a trade deal with the 10-nation bloc, which includes the Philippines, Indonesia, Brunei, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Burma. He told a virtual business summit organized by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations that a free trade agreement with Canada would be a “win-win” for all sides, particularly coming out of the pandemic. Speaking in a pre-recorded message, Trudeau argued that an agreement with ASEAN would help companies and entrepreneurs build connections and business relationships around the world. He also said a pact would give investors more confidence to invest in international markets, and protect supply chains from the uncertainties brought by COVID-19. Trade bottlenecks across the globe have been slower to recover than consumer demand for goods, and slowed further by ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks and public health measures. All this affects inventories of in-demand consumer products or the delivery of parts needed to build things like cars, and pushes up transportation costs that get passed on to consumers, which is reflected in higher inflation rates. “As we finish the fight against COVID-19, deepening our ties with ASEAN economies and diversifying trade across the Asia-Pacific will play a crucial role in our recovery,” Trudeau said in his address. “My friends, a strong Canada-ASEAN relationship is a clear win-win for all of our businesses and all of our people.” The economies of the 10-nation bloc as a group represent Canada’s sixth largest trading partner, but the country already has access to four ASEAN members — Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam — through a Pacific Rim trade pact known as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). The Liberals’ election platform promised a new hub to help businesses take advantage of opportunities under CPTPP, and a new Asia-Pacific strategy aimed at deepening ties in the region, including new trade deals. A preliminary analysis by ASEAN and the federal government on the merits of a free trade deal estimated Canadian exports of goods and services to the bloc could go up by 13.3 per cent, valued at US$2.67 billion In his address, Trudeau said both sides must also ensure women, Indigenous people, LGBTQ entrepreneurs, visible minorities and other under-represented business owners get involved in and benefit from trade.

SINGAPORE, Oct 25 — The Truth Warriors website has been issued a correction direction for publishing materials that promote the efficacy of ivermectin in treating Covid-19 and cast doubt on the effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines. The website is required to publish the correction notice at the top of each webpage containing the falsehoods, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a statement on Saturday (Oct 25). The Minister for Health has instructed the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) Office to issue the notice, added MOH. “Many of the materials published on the Truth Warriors website mislead people into thinking that Covid-19 vaccines are not effective in reducing transmission rates of Covid-19, and promote the safety and efficacy of ivermectin in preventing viral infections and treating Covid-19,” said MOH. These materials are from “unverified and dubious sources” and individuals who heed the advice of the website can endanger themselves and the people around them, said the ministry. It added that the Government takes a serious view of the deliberate communication of these falsehoods and criminal investigations will be conducted.MOH said the following were falsehoods on the Truth Warriors website: The most vaccinated countries have the most cases and deaths per million population and the least vaccinated countries have the fewest cases and deaths per million population Vaccines do not prevent the transmission of Covid-19.MOH said that all these claims were false and that as of Oct 23, the weight of international evidence shows categorically that vaccines reduce Covid-19 infection, as well as serious illness and mortality rates. “The latest data does not support the claim that countries with the highest vaccination rates also have the highest cases/deaths per million population. While some countries with the lowest vaccination rates also have low reported Covid-19 deaths, this is likely due to poor record collection for both vaccinations and deaths,” it said. It added that while vaccines do not completely stop viral transmission, vaccines do reduce the risk of transmission as vaccinated persons are less likely to transmit the virus than unvaccinated persons. “Furthermore, while the vaccine on its own does not kill the virus, it is false to suggest that the effect of the vaccine on the immune system does not lead to the killing of the virus. The vaccines cause the body to produce antibodies and immune cells that act against the virus and, in effect, kill it,” explained MOH. As for the website’s claims that ivermectin prevents Covid-19 infection, and that it is safe and effective in treating Covid-19, even for pregnant women, MOH said that self-medicating with it can be dangerous. Ivermectin, it said, is a prescription-only medicine registered in Singapore specifically for the treatment of parasitic worm infections and not an anti-viral medicine. Side-effects include vomiting, diarrhoea, stomach pain, neurologic adverse events (dizziness, seizures, confusion), sudden drop in blood pressure, severe skin rash potentially requiring hospitalisation, and liver injury (hepatitis). Ivermectin can also interact with other medications used, such as blood thinners, it said. MOH added that the website also shares user-collated and unverified data on suspected vaccine injuries in Singapore, citing the “SG Suspected Vaccine Injuries” Telegram chat as its source. “We advise members of the public not to speculate and/or spread misinformation which may cause public alarm, and to refer to credible sources of information instead,” it said. MOH urged the public to visit www.moh.gov.sg and www.hsa.gov.sg for the latest information on Covid-19 and Covid-19 vaccinations. — TODAY",2021-10-25 00:37:12,,,malaymail,True,"[('the Ministry of Health', 'ORG'), ('Saturday', 'DATE'), ('Instagram', 'ORG'), ('Telegram', 'ORG'), ('SINGAPORE', 'GPE'), ('Oct 25', 'DATE'), ('The Truth Warriors', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('the Ministry of Health', 'ORG'), ('Saturday', 'DATE'), ('Oct 25', 'DATE'), ('the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act', 'ORG'), ('POFMA) Office', 'ORG'), ('Government', 'ORG'), ('MOH', 'ORG'), ('million', 'CARDINAL'), ('Vaccines', 'PERSON'), ('Covid-19.MOH', 'ORG'), ('Oct 23', 'DATE'), ('MOH', 'ORG'), ('ivermectin', 'NORP'), ('MOH', 'ORG'), ('Ivermectin', 'PERSON'), ('Singapore', 'GPE'), ('Ivermectin', 'PERSON'), ('MOH', 'ORG'), ('Singapore', 'GPE'), ('SG Suspected Vaccine Injuries', 'WORK_OF_ART')]"

WASHINGTON, Oct 25 — Vaccines for kids between the ages of five and 11 will likely be available in the first half of November, top US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said on Sunday, predicting a timetable that could see many kids getting fully vaccinated before the end of the year.“If all goes well, and we get the regulatory approval and the recommendation from the CDC, it’s entirely possible if not very likely that vaccines will be available for children from five to 11 within the first week or two of November,” Fauci said in an interview with ABC’s This Week.US Food and Drug Administration officials are reviewing the Pfizer/BioNTech application seeking authorization of its two-dose vaccine for younger children, with its panel of outside advisers scheduled to weigh in on Oct. 26.The FDA typically follows the advice of its panel but is not required to do so.Advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will weigh in on recommendations for the vaccine at a meeting on Nov. 2 and Nov. 3, helping to inform a final decision by its director.CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, speaking at Fox News Sunday, also said the agency wanted to act swiftly.“After they (FDA) are able to review all the science and conduct the regulatory action and the CDC will meet, and if all of that goes smoothly ... we will act quickly,” she said.“We know how many parents are interested in getting their children between 5 and 11 vaccinated and we intend to act as quickly as we can,” she added.Once authorised, roughly 28 million more children in the United States would be eligible to receive what would be the first US Covid-19 vaccine for younger kids. The Pfizer/BioNTech shot is already available to those ages 12-17, and the companies are still studying it for children younger than five.While children have a lower rate of death from Covid-19, many face illness and long-term symptoms that are still being studied. Many adults who have been hesitant or opposed to the Covid-19 vaccine, and even some who did not oppose the vaccine for themselves, are expected to resist giving the shot to their children.Asked if schools should mandate a vaccine for kids, Walensky said: “Right now we are at authorisation. We’re having discussions about authorisation. I think we need to get children vaccinated through this authorisation and get to approval before we can make a judgement there.” — Reuters",2021-10-24 23:19:18,,,malaymail,True,"[('between the ages of five and 11', 'DATE'), ('the first half of November', 'DATE'), ('US', 'GPE'), ('Anthony Fauci', 'PERSON'), ('Reuters', 'ORG'), ('Instagram', 'ORG'), ('Telegram', 'ORG'), ('WASHINGTON', 'GPE'), ('Oct 25', 'DATE'), ('between the ages of five and 11', 'DATE'), ('the first half of November', 'DATE'), ('US', 'GPE'), ('Anthony Fauci', 'PERSON'), ('Sunday', 'DATE'), ('the end of the year', 'DATE'), ('CDC', 'ORG'), ('five to 11', 'CARDINAL'), ('the first week', 'DATE'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('Fauci', 'ORG'), ('ABC', 'ORG'), ('This Week', 'DATE'), ('US Food and Drug Administration', 'ORG'), ('Pfizer', 'PERSON'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('FDA', 'ORG'), ('the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'ORG'), ('CDC', 'ORG'), ('Nov. 2 and Nov. 3', 'DATE'), ('CDC', 'ORG'), ('Rochelle Walensky', 'PERSON'), ('Fox News', 'ORG'), ('Sunday', 'DATE'), ('FDA', 'ORG'), ('CDC', 'ORG'), ('between 5 and 11', 'DATE'), ('roughly 28 million', 'CARDINAL'), ('the United States', 'GPE'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('US', 'GPE'), ('Pfizer', 'PERSON'), ('younger than five', 'CARDINAL'), ('Walensky', 'PERSON'), ('Reuters', 'ORG')]"

The small county bordering Mongolia is the current outbreak’s hotspot, home to nearly one-third of the more than 150 infections found over the past week in the mainland.The lockdown came a day after a warning from National Health Commission officials that the outbreak would continue to worsen after spreading to 11 provinces in about a week.

The encounter, earlier reported by Florida Politics, took place between Senator Tina Polsky and Joseph Ladapo, who met her in her office regarding his upcoming confirmation after being appointed by Governor Ron DeSantis. She has been diagnosed with breast cancer. “He’s very smug,” Polsky said. “And I told him several times, ‘I have this very serious medical condition.’ And he said, ‘That’s OK,’ like it basically has nothing to do with what we are talking about.’”Ladapo has questioned the vaccine’s efficacy and safety, and like DeSantis, opposes shot mandates. Florida was hit hard by the latest wave of the virus, accounting at one point for a fifth of U.S. cases. Pediatricians Should Vaccinate Kids, Gottlieb Says (1:09 p.m. NY)Children ages 5 to 11 should be vaccinated in their pediatrician’s offices, said Scott Gottlieb, former head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. He’s a board member of Pfizer Inc., whose vaccine is to be considered for authorization for young children. “Getting children vaccinated is a much more consultative endeavor,” Gottlieb said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “You don’t want children to have to go to mass vaccination sites or even necessarily a pharmacy. You want them to go into the comfort of their own pediatrician’s office.”He said the vaccine, developed with BioNTec SE, will be packaged for doctors’ offices.U.S. Kids Set for Shots by Early November (11:30 a.m. NY)Two top U.S. health officials signaled confidence that children ages 5 to 11 will begin getting Covid-19 vaccines by early November. “If all goes well, and we get the regulatory approval ... it’s entirely possible if not very likely that vaccines will be available for children from five to 11 within the first week or two of November,” Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, said on ABC’s “This Week.”His comments were echoed by Rochelle Walensky, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which must ultimately approve the shots. “There will be vaccine out there so children can start rolling up their sleeves,” Walensky said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”Health experts say vaccinating children will be a key step in helping end the U.S. outbreak, though a Kaiser Family Foundation study found in September that only about a third of parents would vaccinate their children immediately. Almost 65 million eligible Americans ages 12 and older are not vaccinated. Advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will meet Tuesday to consider data for children’s use of the vaccine by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE. Approval by the FDA and the CDC is also required.Sunak Plays Down New U.K. Curbs (6:18 a.m. NY)U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak told the BBC that available Covid-19 data don’t support a move to harsher restrictions.

COVID doesn't need to run rampant. Here are 6 ways to keep cases low in the next year,https://theconversation.com/covid-doesnt-need-to-run-rampant-here-are-6-ways-to-keep-cases-low-in-the-next-year-170207,,"['Brendan Crabb', ' Director and CEO', ' Burnet Institute']",,,"In the blink of an eye, we’ve gone from 18 months of zero tolerance for COVID to accepting huge case numbers as the norm for Australia’s foreseeable future. Our ambitions are now limited to simply keeping a lid on things to avoid our health systems being overwhelmed – not that we’ve defined what that limit is. But how many lives, severe illnesses, and cases of long COVID are we willing to accept? The national and other roadmaps aren’t explicit about this. NSW and Victoria have regularly seen 10-15 lives lost each day to COVID, so this could represent the baseline rather than the cap. The impact of long COVID simply isn’t considered in the risk-benefit equation. It’s time to draw breath and consider a better alternative. High case numbers aren’t our only path to freedom. It’s not inevitable all Australians will get COVID in the near future. We could keep numbers low now and move to a strategy of eliminating the virus, like we do for measles, mumps, rubella and whooping cough, just to name a few. A strategy of local COVID elimination shouldn’t be taboo when it’s the norm for many other infectious diseases. Why do high case numbers matter if we’re all vaccinated? COVID vaccines are truly brilliant, especially against severe disease. They provide the essential base to move away from harsh public health measures. But like any medical intervention, they’re not perfect, even against severe illness. You aren’t bulletproof if you’ve had two doses. In fact, as Health Minister Greg Hunt announced last week, you’ll probably need a third dose soon. What’s more, releasing restrictions across the country is based on vaccination targets for those over 16 years. But reaching 70% and 80% targets leaves 30% or 20% of people unvaccinated and at risk in this group alone. Importantly this will include pockets of communities with much lower vaccination levels than others. Plus all children under 12 will be unvaccinated. Together, that’s 5-10 million unvaccinated Australians. Let’s be clear, the virus is and will be in our community for some time. This is sometimes inaccurately described as “endemic”, as in, a settled and predictable infection. COVID isn’t that yet, and we have no idea when it will be. COVID will remain epidemic for some time, characterised by bursts in at-risk communities and pockets of under-vaccinated people, because of waning immunity or new variants. If not countered, this epidemic scenario will continue to disrupt our health and economy. So, we need a ‘vaccines-plus’ strategy Keeping COVID numbers low presents a substantial challenge, especially in deeply fatigued NSW and Victoria. But as OzSAGE, an Australian network of scientists providing advice on COVID, has detailed, it can be achieved with a deliberate “vaccines-plus” strategy. The “plus” includes a range of minimally disruptive measures to keep transmission down, such as improving ventilation and maintaining the use of masks in higher risk settings. Victoria’s schools’ package is the best current example of appropriate ambition in this space. International examples tell us vaccines-plus works vastly better than vaccine-only. Keeping numbers low also presents a positive-feedback loop as it enables a functioning test, trace, isolate and quarantine system that’s crucial to keeping a lid on numbers. Keeping numbers low now doesn’t just delay the inevitable. In fact, a major motivation for holding the line is the future will be much better. Six ways to strengthen our COVID defences In 12 months’ time, the tools for interrupting transmission and managing COVID as a sporadic infectious disease will be substantially stronger than they are now. A realistic vision for a year from now includes: 1. Vastly improved vaccination Three shots will be routine and 80-90% of the whole population will be fully vaccinated in this way. Kids over five will also immunised, and we’ll be on the way to approving vaccines for those under five. This goal is likely to be achieved in six months rather than 12. We’ll be able to identify people who need further boosters using “immunity tests”, which provide a surrogate measure of people’s immunity. These are being developed by the Burnet and Doherty Institutes. Vaccines will prevent much more transmission than they do now. 2. Much less airborne transmission Clean air will be provided in risky indoor settings in a regulated and accepted way. Indoor density limits, and improved, targeted mask-wearing will be normalised in settings like public transport and schools. 3. New treatments Advances in therapy are likely to change the game completely. These could be simple pills or inhalers. For example, Australia recently purchased Merck’s COVID pill “molnupiravir”, which the company said halved the risk of hospitalisation and death. This is just a taster of what’s to come. Read more: Take-at-home COVID drug molnupiravir may be on its way — but vaccination is still our first line of defence 4. Improved test, trace, isolate and quarantine People who have COVID will easily and quickly know they’re positive and stay home while infectious. Our test, trace, isolate and quarantine systems will be functional and modernised, perhaps even using artificial intelligence. Self-testing, at home and elsewhere, will be widespread. 5. Traffic light quarantine system Borders will be open but risk-assessed. High-risk travellers will still have some form of quarantine. This is especially important to keep new variants at bay. 6. Reduced COVID in the region It’s really not an option for the developed world to let infections run free in low-income countries. COVID doesn’t need to run rampant Letting COVID run is a risky experiment and most countries with greater experience of the impact of COVID infections have rejected this approach. An ambitious attitude to elimination can be achieved with a vaccines-plus strategy now and embracing innovations as they inevitably come. The second-best pandemic outcome is for most Australians to be fully vaccinated before they encounter the virus for the first time. After 18 months of monumental effort, and to this country’s enduring credit, this objective will be achieved. But there’s an even more important end goal for our health, free society, and economy – for most Australians to never encounter the virus at all, or if they do, to not be infected by it. In 12 months’ time, our defence against COVID will be stronger. We need a vaccines-plus strategy to safely get us there.

However, biotech stocks can rebound quickly after bad news. Should growth-oriented investors consider buying these beaten-down biotech stocks next week? Let's take a deeper dive to find out. Image source: Getty Images. Atea Pharmaceuticals: Has max pain been reached? Atea's shares crumbled last week after its Roche -partnered direct-acting antiviral pill, AT-527, flopped in a phase 2 trial for patients with mild or moderate cases of COVID-19. The back story is that AT-527 was on track to possibly become a megablockbuster orally administered treatment for COVID-19. That investing thesis isn't completely off the table, as the drug is still making its way through a pivotal trial. Moreover, Atea and Roche are reportedly adding more high-risk COVID-19 patients with underlying health conditions to this ongoing phase 3 trial, which ought to boost the drug's chances of success. But that all-important data readout is now expected to be delayed by up to six months. Can Atea's shares rebound? I think there's a reasonable chance that this small-cap biotech could indeed rebound in the weeks and months to come. The failed phase 2 trial for AT-527 contained both vaccinated patients and patients with milder forms of the disease. What's more, the drug did reportedly show a clinical benefit in higher-risk patients. The bad news is that Atea and Roche's oral COVID-19 pill would probably be the third one on the market if this phase 3 trial hits its primary endpoint. So while the megablockbuster sales thesis is probably out the window, AT-527 could still post some impressive sales at the end of the day. In short, Atea's stock will undoubtedly require investor patience, but it does come across as an intriguing rebound candidate. Agenus: A regulatory miscue Agenus, a small-cap cancer specialist, lost almost a quarter of its value last week. Shareholders hit the exits on this stock last week after the company announced that it had withdrawn the Biologics License Application (BLA) for the second-line cervical cancer drug known as balstilimab. The company did so in response to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s granting a full approval for Merck 's rival therapy, Keytruda, for this indication. Agenus also announced that it will discontinue the drug's ongoing confirmatory trial in this patient population, which ought to slash the company's research and development expenses by a healthy $100 million. Where do things stand now? My take is that investors overreacted to this news. Balstilimab's monotherapy indication as a treatment for advanced cervical cancer was never going to be a big moneymaker for the company. Agenus even admitted as much in its press release last week. By contrast, Agenus' next-generation checkpoint inhibitor therapies , and partnerships with the likes of Bristol Myers Squibb , Gilead Sciences , among others, will ultimately be the biotech's core value drivers. In fact, I think this tiny cancer company will have one of its partners buy it out within the next 12 months. The emerging trend in biopharma is to acquire promising cancer assets early in their developmental process, and Agenus has an expansive pipeline chock-full of those types of therapies. Novavax: Can this vaccine company deliver? Shares of vaccine developer Novavax plunged by almost 17% last week, following a Politico article claiming that the biotech's COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing process may not be up to regulators' quality standards. The big deal is that the article's anonymous sources reported that the company could take until the end of 2022 to resolve these manufacturing issues and win regulatory authorizations for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate. By then, the pandemic may be winding down, thereby lowering the demand for additional vaccines. So, in a worst-case scenario, Novavax's experimental COVID-19 vaccine may badly miss Wall Street's sky-high revenue projections in the coming years. Can Novavax adapt and overcome? The company has repeatedly missed its own regulatory submission deadlines for the vaccine this year, and it has no experience at scaling up its manufacturing process to bring a product to market. That's the bad news. The good news is that the company's management did note in a reponse to this article that it remains confident in its ability to produce high-quality vaccines at scale. If true, Novavax's stock should rebound nicely from this hefty downturn. The biotech's stock, after all, is currently trading at less than 2 times 2022 projected revenue -- which is dirt cheap for a biotech stock. Ocular Therapeutix: A key clinical setback Ocular Therapeutix saw its shares crater by 38% last week in response to a failed phase 2 trial for the dry-eye treatment OTX-CSI, a hydrogel insert containing the immunosuppressant medication cyclosporine. The biopharma and its shareholders had hoped that this experimental treatment would be a healthy revenue generator for the company in the years ahead. Those hopes, however, were dashed when the drug failed to boost tear production in this midstage trial. Can Ocular's stock recover this lost ground? I think there's a strong probability that this beaten-down biotech will recover, and perhaps quickly. The biotech has multiple upcoming clinical catalysts in the high-value areas of episodic dry-eye disease, glaucoma, and wet age-related macular degeneration.

A recent study found that the Moderna and Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine boosters shots produced stronger immunity than the Johnson & Johnson booster shot.

How Rishi Sunak plans to spend our money – what we know about Wednesday’s Budget,https://metro.co.uk/2021/10/24/how-rishi-sunak-plans-to-spend-our-money-for-uk-budget-2021-15477263/,"['UK', 'Economy', 'Rishi Sunak']",['James Hockaday'],,More than £20billion in funding has already been pledged in a wide range of areas.,"Rishi Sunak has already made plenty of announcements ahead of next week’s Budget (Picture: Getty Images/Jeff Overs/BBC/PA) The Chancellor to announce more than £20billion in funding for transport links outside London, health research and a ‘skills revolution’ next week. Rishi Sunak says he wants to build a stronger economy with his Budget as the nation’s businesses recover from the fallout of Covid-19. It will be the second time this year he has stood in front of MPs and updated them on the state of the nation’s finances, as last year’s budget was delayed until March due to coronavirus. Some 11 areas of investment were announced by the Treasury over the weekend, so there may not be many surprises next week. While he’s made a number of spending pledges, Sunak is also expected to impress on MPs the importance of keeping public finances in a healthy state. Speaking to Times Radio this morning, the Chancellor said that over the past year his main focus was ‘protecting people’s livelihoods, their incomes, their jobs’ amid the pandemic. But he added it was now time to shore up the economy to weather any future storms. He told BBC One’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘That means strong investment in public services, driving economic growth by investing in infrastructure, innovation and skills, giving businesses confidence, and then supporting working families. ‘Those are the ingredients of what makes a stronger Budget and that’s what we will deliver next week.’ But the Chancellor faces a number of challenges, not least a warning from the Bank of England’s new chief economist that inflation could rise above 5%. Sunak told Marr that countries all over the world are facing this issue, due to energy prices and economies opening up rapidly as Covid restrictions are eased. He added: ‘Both of those factors are global factors. We’re not alone in experiencing those problems, I don’t have a magic wand that can make either of those things disappear.’ Public sector workers will also learn if they are getting a payrise, Sunak confirmed this morning, after pay was paused in 2021/22 with the exception of NHS workers on less than £24,000. What do we know about the Budget so far? Transport Tram networks in a number of UK cities are set to be expanded under a £6.9billion investment package (Picture: Getty Images) The Chancellor has already announced a £6.9billion package to ‘level up’ transport links outside of London. Sunak is set to put £5.7billion into station upgrades and sustainable transport settlements for city regions outside the capital to boost productivity. The money will also go towards the expansion of tram networks in a number of cities, as metro mayors are handed the money over a five year period. The Chancellor will also announce £1.2billion of new funding to improve the nation’s bus services, as part of the £3 billion committed by Boris Johnson. Education and children A total of £1.6billion will go towards more lesson time for students taking their T-levels (Picture: Getty Images) Sunak is set to announce a £3billion investment in both post-16 education and training of adults in later life. The Chancellor hopes the package will give people ‘the skills they need to earn more and get on in life’. The number of skills boot camps under the Government’s Plan for Jobs is also set to be quadrupled in areas such as the nuclear industry, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. Some 24,000 traineeships will be created, while £1.6billion will go towards more lesson time for 100,000 students aged 16 to 19 taking their T-levels – technical qualifications introduced in September last year. Existing colleges in England are to be allocated £830million with extra funding for new equipment and facilities. The National Skills Fund will be boosted with a total investment of £550million to quadruple the number of places on the skills boot camps, which are available for adults of any age. Sunak will also announce the expansion of free Level 3 courses for adults, which are equivalent to A-levels, in subjects like maths, chemistry and biology. Critics have said a £500million package to support families with young children still isn’t enough (Picture: Getty Images/iStockphoto) Apprenticeship funding will also increase by £170million to £2.7billion in 2024/25 under the new package. A care package of £500million has also been set aside to boost the development of children in early years education. The Early Years Alliance said critical support is needed for nurseries, childminders and pre-schools, where there have been thousands of recent closures. The care package includes around £80million to create another 75 family hubs across England. They are support centres for families to access services in one place.

Some 300,000 of the most vulnerable in society will be supported with an extra £200million to support people through complex issues that could lead to family breakdown. But Labour said the package barely undoes the damage caused by the Conservatives’ near-decade of austerity, while critics noted a number of services which won’t get funding. Next week’s budget will also include £700million to improve sports and youth clubs and £560million to provide personalised maths coaching. Health Sunak said the pandemic has shown ‘how important innovative research and development is in delivering new, life-saving treatments’ (Picture: PA) The Department of Health and Social Care will be handed £5billion over three years to invest in, among other areas, genomics sequencing and health inequalities. The Chancellor said the pandemic had shown ‘how important innovative research and development is in delivering new, life-saving treatments’. The Office for Life Sciences will receive £95million to deliver on promises over cancer, obesity and mental health. A UK-wide trial of antiviral treatments for Covid-19 will be given £33million, while £40million will be spent on social care reform. The Budget will also include a £30million investment in research and skills training and £20million on research into climate change and health. Sunak is also set to promise £5million for Armed Forces charities to go towards cutting-edge treatments for veterans. Immigration Border Force’s fleet will be retired as 11 new vessels come into service (Picture: Getty Images) Ageing Border Force vessels will be replaced by new cutters as part of a £700million investment to boost security at Britain’s borders, the Treasury have confirmed. The current fleet, which is 20 years old, will be retired and 11 new vessels will come into service to help tackle organised crime and illegal migration at a cost of £74million. Sunak’s budget also includes £628million ‘to modernise and digitalise the border’, with proposals including a US-style Electronic Travel Authorisation for tourists wishing to come to the UK. Electronic authorisations will launch in 2023 and be fully in place two years later and, like the American system, will allow authorities to decide if people should be allowed to travel to the UK prior to their arrival. The Spending Review will also include just over £1billion to be spent over the next three years on ‘new UK sovereign functions’ following Brexit. This will include money for more than 1,000 Border Force officers to deliver customs and transit checks, the Treasury added. Crime The Chancellor’s package aims to crack down on violent offences against women (Picture: Getty Images) A £435million package of measures aimed at preventing crime will form part of next week’s Budget – with a focus on violent offences against women. The Chancellor is expected to pledge millions for better CCTV and improved street lighting and give £80million in additional funding to the Crown Prosecution Service. The Treasury said part of this funding will ‘improve the response to rape and sexual assault cases’. The statement follows widespread shock at the murder of Sarah Everard at the hands of Metropolitan Police officer Wayne Couzens and forces dealing with hundreds of spikings pubs and nightclubs. Funding for victims is also expected to be increased, with the Treasury saying it will be £185million, an increase of 85% from 2019-20 Industry The Treasury will hand out grants to get international firms to invest in the UK’s critical industries (Picture: PA) A £1.4billion Global Britain Investment Fund will hand out grants to encourage internationally mobile companies to invest in the UK’s critical industries, including life sciences and automotive. The Treasury said companies with ‘strategically important investment proposals’ would be able to get grants towards their schemes through the fund. A new talent network will also be set up in innovation hotspots, first in the Bay Area of San Francisco and Boston in the US in 2022, and also Bengaluru in India. Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), said to recover from the pandemic businesses need to get investing. She said: ‘This scheme hits the spot when it comes to some of our most innovative industries in the UK. ‘Businesses will be hopeful that there will be more to come from the Chancellor next week to help get firms investing.’ Arts and culture A number of institutions including the National Railway Museum are to benefit from an £850million package (Picture: Science Museum Group) The Treasury is also set to provide a £850million boost to ‘breathe life’ back into cultural hotspots under a three-year investment. It will be used to upgrade popular galleries and museums, including Tate Liveprool, the V&A and the Imperial War Museum in Duxford. York’s National Railway Museum and the British Library’s Boston Spa site are also expected to benefit from the package. A total of £125million will go towards the building of a new state of the art scientific research centre in Oxfordshire. Part of the Natural History Museum – the centre is set to open in 2026 and will house 27million specimens – over a a third of the museum’s collection.

The Chancellor said: ‘From science museums to art galleries to our most cherished historical sites, I am proud to be part of a country with such a strong cultural heritage. ‘That is why we’re investing hundreds of millions – so it’s not just today people can enjoy their favourite spots, but for generations to come.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.

China warns of further spread in latest COVID-19 flare-up,https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/china-warns-further-coronavirus-spread-october-24-2021,,['Reuters'],,"More than 100 locally transmitted cases have been confirmed over the last week across 11 provincial areas, with most linked to 13 different tour groups","China’s latest COVID-19 outbreak is increasingly likely to spread further, a health official said on Sunday, October 24, as authorities urged all regions to step up monitoring and called for a reduction in travel across provinces. China has largely contained the virus but it is determined to stamp out any sporadic local outbreaks, particularly in the run-up to the 2022 Winter Olympics in February. More than 100 locally transmitted cases have been confirmed over the last week across 11 provincial areas, with most linked to 13 different tour groups. There is increasing risk that the outbreak might spread further, helped by “seasonal factors,” Mi Feng, spokesman at the National Health Commission, told reporters on Sunday. The Delta variant causing the outbreak is also highly transmissible, said commission deputy director Wu Liangyou, adding that sequencing showed it to be different from the source of an earlier outbreak, and suggesting that the new cases came from a new source from abroad. Authorities have banned travel agencies from arranging cross-provincial tours that involve regions deemed of higher virus risk, and has imposed nationwide suspension on some travel services linking multiple tourist attractions. The capital Beijing has said it will impose strict restriction on travels to the city by people who have been to counties with at least one infection. Health authorities also said on Sunday that about 75.6% of China’s population had received complete vaccine doses as of Oct. 23, or some 1.068 billion people. China is giving booster shots to adults whose last dose was at least six months earlier, with priority groups including essential workers, older people and those with weaker immune systems. Data showed antibodies elicited by vaccines, including the most-used shots from Sinovac and Sinopharm, declined within months. Wang Huaqing, chief expert for the immunization program at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said China would not keep giving people booster shots indefinitely. “Even if it needs to be strengthened later, the number of boosters is limited,” Wang told the briefing. “We hope in the future there will be better vaccines and better vaccination procedures to achieve solid protection among the public.” – Rappler.com",2021-10-24 12:25:31,"China's latest COVID-19 outbreak is increasingly likely to spread further, a health official said on Sunday, October 24, as authorities urged all regions to step up monitoring and called for a reduction in travel across provinces.

"Parents more hesitant to vaccinate kids than themselves, researcher says",https://lethbridgenewsnow.com/2021/10/24/parents-more-hesitant-to-vaccinate-kids-than-themselves-researcher-says/,,,,"OTTAWA - Jennifer Hubert jumped at the opportunity to get her COVID-19 vaccine, but she's not looking forward to having to make the decision about whe...","OTTAWA — Jennifer Hubert jumped at the opportunity to get her COVID-19 vaccine, but she’s not looking forward to having to make the decision about whether to vaccinate her three-year-old son Jackson. She recognizes the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, but said she also understands her son is at a much lower risk for serious illness than older adults. “To me it’s not a clear benefit,” she said. While many parents were overjoyed at the news that Health Canada is considering approval of the first COVID-19 vaccine for kids age five to 11 in Canada, parents like Hubert are feeling more trepidatious, and public health officials said they are going to have a much more nuanced conversation with parents about vaccination than they did with adults. While 82 per cent of eligible Canadians aged 12 and up are already fully vaccinated, a recent survey by Angus Reid shows only 51 per cent of parents plan to immediately vaccinate their kids when a pediatric dose becomes available. Of parents with children in the five to 11 year age range, 23 per cent said they would never give their kids a COVID-19 vaccine, 18 per cent said they would wait, and nine per cent said they weren’t sure, according to the survey of 5,011 Canadians between Sept. 29 and Oct. 3, which cannot be assigned a margin of error because online surveys are not considered random samples. “Most of the research that I’ve seen sort of indicates that parents are more hesitant to vaccinate their kids against COVID than themselves,” said Kate Allen, a post-doctoral fellow at the Center for Vaccine Preventable Diseases of the University of Toronto. There are several reasons parents might pause, she said. It’s true that children are at a much lower risk of serious outcomes associated with COVID-19, and there have been very rare incidents of mRNA vaccines like Pfizer or Moderna linked to cases of myocarditis, a swelling of the heart muscle. As of Oct. 1, Health Canada has documented 859 cases associated with the vaccines, which mainly seem to affect people under 40 years old, and people who’ve developed the complication have typically been fine. “I know it’s rare, I know it’s not deadly, but I also see the risk of severe symptoms from COVID as being rare and not deadly for Jackson,” Hubert said when asked about weighing up the risks and benefits of the vaccine. But public health experts stress that some children do suffer from rare but serious impacts from COVID-19, which can also cause myocarditis as well as the little-understood impacts of the condition known as long COVID. They say parents should consider the less tangible benefits of vaccination as well. “It’s less of a conversation about a direct benefit to them, and more of a community benefit,” Allen said. The pandemic has taken a heavy toll on children, depriving them of school, time with their peers, extracurriculars — and their mental health has suffered as a result, said Dr. Vinita Dubey, associate medical officer of health with Toronto Public Health. “Not one child has been spared from this pandemic. I mean every single child has had to bear a sacrifice because of the pandemic in one way or the other,” Dubey said. So far Pfizer-BioNtech is the only manufacturer to request approval for its pediatric COVID-19 vaccine and Health Canada is still reviewing the data. The regulator has promised the review will be thorough, and the vaccine will only be approved for children if the benefits outweigh the potential risks. Policy-makers know they’re going to have to take parents’ concerns seriously as well. On a recent tour of the Childrens’ Hospital of Eastern Ontario in Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with Dr. Anne Pham-Huy, a pediatric infectious diseases physician. “Vaccine confidence is going to be the most important part of it this time around,” Pham-Huy said, to which Trudeau agreed. Dubey has published research on improving parents’ vaccine confidence when it comes to long-established inoculations like mumps and rubella. While she offered several tips, they mainly come down to building trust. Her research focused on the role of family doctors, but she said during the pandemic anyone can be that trusted sounding board. “It could be a faith leader, it could be an important family member or friend, someone who you trust, to help guide you to the right sources to make that decision,” she said. With that in mind, several students from across North America launched a peer-to-peer education program called Students for Herd Immunity to allow kids to have those conversations among themselves. The public health experts agree, the debate around vaccines has become polarized and open conversations will be the key to addressing parents’ concerns. “I think one thing to say to parents is you don’t have to make your decision right away,” Dubey said. “I mean for those who are ready to make their decision, but it’s fine but if you have questions, seek the answers.” Her only advice is to get those answers from a trusted source, and not social media.

While many parents were overjoyed at the news that Health Canada is considering approval of the first COVID-19 vaccine for kids age five to 11 in Canada, parents like Hubert are feeling more trepidatious, and public health officials said they are going to have a much more nuanced conversation with parents about vaccination than they did with adults. While 82 per cent of eligible Canadians aged 12 and up are already fully vaccinated, a recent survey by Angus Reid shows only 51 per cent of parents plan to immediately vaccinate their kids when a pediatric dose becomes available. Of parents with children in the five to 11 year age range, 23 per cent said they would never give their kids a COVID-19 vaccine, 18 per cent said they would wait, and nine per cent said they weren’t sure, according to the survey of 5,011 Canadians between Sept. 29 and Oct. 3, which cannot be assigned a margin of error because online surveys are not considered random samples. “Most of the research that I’ve seen sort of indicates that parents are more hesitant to vaccinate their kids against COVID than themselves,” said Kate Allen, a post-doctoral fellow at the Center for Vaccine Preventable Diseases of the University of Toronto. There are several reasons parents might pause, she said. It’s true that children are at a much lower risk of serious outcomes associated with COVID-19, and there have been very rare incidents of mRNA vaccines like Pfizer or Moderna linked to cases of myocarditis, a swelling of the heart muscle. As of Oct. 1, Health Canada has documented 859 cases associated with the vaccines, which mainly seem to affect people under 40 years old, and people who’ve developed the complication have typically been fine. “I know it’s rare, I know it’s not deadly, but I also see the risk of severe symptoms from COVID as being rare and not deadly for Jackson,” Hubert said when asked about weighing up the risks and benefits of the vaccine. But public health experts stress that some children do suffer from rare but serious impacts from COVID-19, which can also cause myocarditis as well as the little-understood impacts of the condition known as long COVID. They say parents should consider the less tangible benefits of vaccination as well. “It’s less of a conversation about a direct benefit to them, and more of a community benefit,” Allen said. The pandemic has taken a heavy toll on children, depriving them of school, time with their peers, extracurriculars — and their mental health has suffered as a result, said Dr. Vinita Dubey, associate medical officer of health with Toronto Public Health. “Not one child has been spared from this pandemic. I mean every single child has had to bear a sacrifice because of the pandemic in one way or the other,” Dubey said. So far Pfizer-BioNtech is the only manufacturer to request approval for its pediatric COVID-19 vaccine and Health Canada is still reviewing the data. The regulator has promised the review will be thorough, and the vaccine will only be approved for children if the benefits outweigh the potential risks. Policy-makers know they’re going to have to take parents’ concerns seriously as well. On a recent tour of the Childrens’ Hospital of Eastern Ontario in Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with Dr. Anne Pham-Huy, a pediatric infectious diseases physician. “Vaccine confidence is going to be the most important part of it this time around,” Pham-Huy said, to which Trudeau agreed. Dubey has published research on improving parents’ vaccine confidence when it comes to long-established inoculations like mumps and rubella. While she offered several tips, they mainly come down to building trust. Her research focused on the role of family doctors, but she said during the pandemic anyone can be that trusted sounding board. “It could be a faith leader, it could be an important family member or friend, someone who you trust, to help guide you to the right sources to make that decision,” she said. With that in mind, several students from across North America launched a peer-to-peer education program called Students for Herd Immunity to allow kids to have those conversations among themselves. The public health experts agree, the debate around vaccines has become polarized and open conversations will be the key to addressing parents’ concerns. “I think one thing to say to parents is you don’t have to make your decision right away,” Dubey said. “I mean for those who are ready to make their decision, but it’s fine but if you have questions, seek the answers.” Her only advice is to get those answers from a trusted source, and not social media.

Proyecto africano de vacunas trata de reducir la desigualdad,https://www.infobae.com/america/agencias/2021/10/24/proyecto-africano-de-vacunas-trata-de-reducir-la-desigualdad/,,,,,"CIUDAD DEL CABO, Sudáfrica (AP) — En un par de almacenes de Ciudad del Cabo convertidos en un laberinto de salas estériles selladas, jóvenes científicos preparan y calibran el equipamiento necesario para hacer ingeniería inversa sobre una vacuna de coronavirus que aún no ha llegado a Sudáfrica ni a la mayoría de los más pobres del mundo.La energía que se respira en los brillantes laboratorios está a la altura de la urgencia de su misión por reducir la desigualdad de vacunas. En su trabajo para replicar la vacuna de Moderna contra el COVID-19, los científicos básicamente rodean a una industria que ha priorizado de forma clara a los países ricos sobre los pobres, tanto en ventas como en manufactura.Y lo hacen con el inusual apoyo de la Organización Mundial de la Salud, que coordina un centro de investigación, formación y producción de vacunas en Sudáfrica, así como una cadena de suministro asociada para las cruciales materias primas. Es un esfuerzo de último recurso de producir dosis para los que no tienen, y las implicaciones de propiedad intelectual aún no están claras.“Hacemos esto por África en este momento, y eso nos motiva”, dijo Emile Hendricks, un biotecnólogo de 22 años que trabaja para Afrigen Biologics and Vaccines, la empresa que intenta reproducir el fármaco de Moderna. “Ya no podemos depender de que estas grandes superpotencias vengan y nos salven”.Algunos expertos ven la ingeniería inversa -recrear las vacunas a partir de fragmentos de información pública- como una de las pocas formas de combatir los desequilibrios de poder de la pandemia. Por ahora, sólo el 0,7% de las vacunas han llegado a países de bajos ingresos y casi la mitad han ido a países ricos, según un análisis de la People's Vaccine Alliance.Que la OMS, que depende de la buena voluntad de los países ricos y la industria farmacéutica para existir, lidere el intento de reproducir una vacuna registrada refleja el alcance de la brecha de suministro.La iniciativa con respaldo de la ONU para equiparar la distribución de vacunas, conocida como COVAX, no ha logrado aliviar la grave escasez en los países pobres. Las dosis donadas que llegan son una pequeña parte de lo necesario para reducir la desigualdad. Entre tanto, la presión sobre las farmacéuticas para que compartan, lo que incluye reclamaciones del actual gobierno de Estados Unidos sobre Moderna, no ha dado resultado.Hasta ahora, la OMS nunca había participado en la replicación de una vacuna nueva para su uso global pese a las objeciones de sus desarrolladores originales. El centro de Ciudad del Cabo pretende ampliar el acceso a la nueva tecnología de ARN mensajero empleada en las vacunas de Moderna y de Pfizer y su socio alemán BioNTech.“Esta es la primera vez que lo hacemos a este nivel, debido a la urgencia y también por lo novedoso de esta tecnología”, dijo Martin Friede, coordinador de la OMS que ayuda a dirigir el centro.El doctor Tom Frieden, exdirector de los Centros estadounidenses de Control y Prevención de Enfermedades, ha descrito la situación como un mundo “tomado como rehén” por Moderna y Pfizer, que producen las vacunas consideradas como más efectivas contra el COVID-19. El nuevo proceso de ARN mensajero utiliza la información genética de la proteína espicular del coronavirus y se cree que produce una respuesta inmune mejor que las vacunas tradicionales.El gobierno del presidente de Estados Unidos, Joe Biden, ha argumentado que dado que los contribuyentes estadounidenses financiaron en gran parte el desarrollo de la vacuna de Moderna, la compañía debe ampliar la producción para ayudar a dar suministro a los países en desarrollo.Se estima que el desabastecimiento global hasta 2022 oscila entre 500 millones y 4.000 millones de dosis, dependiendo de cuántas otras vacunas lleguen al mercado.“El gobierno de Estados Unidos ha jugado un papel considerable para hacer de Moderna la empresa que es”, dijo David Kessler, director del programa estadounidense para acelerar el desarrollo de vacunas contra el COVID-19.Kessler no aclaró hasta donde llegaría el gobierno en sus presiones sobre la empresa. “Entienden que esperamos que ocurra”, dijo.Moderna ha prometido construir una fábrica de vacunas en África en algún momento del futuro. Pero tras pedir a las farmacéuticas que compartan sus recetas, materias primas y conocimientos tecnológicos, algunos países más pobres están hartos de esperar.La directora gerente de Afrigen, Petro Terblanche, dijo que la compañía de Ciudad del Cabo aspira a tener una versión de la vacuna de Moderna lista para hacer ensayos en humanos en un año y pasar a la producción comercial poco después.“Tenemos mucha competencia de las grandes farmacéuticas. No quieren vernos tener éxito”, dijo Terblanche. “Ya empiezan a decir que no tenemos la capacidad de hacer esto. Vamos a demostrárselo”.Si el equipo sudafricano tiene éxito en hacer una versión de la vacuna de Moderna, la información se publicará para que otros puedan utilizarla, dijo Terblanche. Ese plan está más cerca de la estrategia que defendió Biden en primavera y a la que la industria farmacéutica se opone con firmeza.La producción comercial está en un punto en el que la propiedad intelectual podría convertirse en un problema.

La energía que se respira en los brillantes laboratorios está a la altura de la urgencia de su misión por reducir la desigualdad de vacunas. En su trabajo para replicar la vacuna de Moderna contra el COVID-19, los científicos básicamente rodean a una industria que ha priorizado de forma clara a los países ricos sobre los pobres, tanto en ventas como en manufactura. Y lo hacen con el inusual apoyo de la Organización Mundial de la Salud, que coordina un centro de investigación, formación y producción de vacunas en Sudáfrica, así como una cadena de suministro asociada para las cruciales materias primas. Es un esfuerzo de último recurso de producir dosis para los que no tienen, y las implicaciones de propiedad intelectual aún no están claras. “Hacemos esto por África en este momento, y eso nos motiva”, dijo Emile Hendricks, un biotecnólogo de 22 años que trabaja para Afrigen Biologics and Vaccines, la empresa que intenta reproducir el fármaco de Moderna. “Ya no podemos depender de que estas grandes superpotencias vengan y nos salven”. Algunos expertos ven la ingeniería inversa -recrear las vacunas a partir de fragmentos de información pública- como una de las pocas formas de combatir los desequilibrios de poder de la pandemia. Por ahora, sólo el 0,7% de las vacunas han llegado a países de bajos ingresos y casi la mitad han ido a países ricos, según un análisis de la People's Vaccine Alliance. Que la OMS, que depende de la buena voluntad de los países ricos y la industria farmacéutica para existir, lidere el intento de reproducir una vacuna registrada refleja el alcance de la brecha de suministro. La iniciativa con respaldo de la ONU para equiparar la distribución de vacunas, conocida como COVAX, no ha logrado aliviar la grave escasez en los países pobres. Las dosis donadas que llegan son una pequeña parte de lo necesario para reducir la desigualdad. Entre tanto, la presión sobre las farmacéuticas para que compartan, lo que incluye reclamaciones del actual gobierno de Estados Unidos sobre Moderna, no ha dado resultado. Hasta ahora, la OMS nunca había participado en la replicación de una vacuna nueva para su uso global pese a las objeciones de sus desarrolladores originales. El centro de Ciudad del Cabo pretende ampliar el acceso a la nueva tecnología de ARN mensajero empleada en las vacunas de Moderna y de Pfizer y su socio alemán BioNTech. “Esta es la primera vez que lo hacemos a este nivel, debido a la urgencia y también por lo novedoso de esta tecnología”, dijo Martin Friede, coordinador de la OMS que ayuda a dirigir el centro. El doctor Tom Frieden, exdirector de los Centros estadounidenses de Control y Prevención de Enfermedades, ha descrito la situación como un mundo “tomado como rehén” por Moderna y Pfizer, que producen las vacunas consideradas como más efectivas contra el COVID-19. El nuevo proceso de ARN mensajero utiliza la información genética de la proteína espicular del coronavirus y se cree que produce una respuesta inmune mejor que las vacunas tradicionales. El gobierno del presidente de Estados Unidos, Joe Biden, ha argumentado que dado que los contribuyentes estadounidenses financiaron en gran parte el desarrollo de la vacuna de Moderna, la compañía debe ampliar la producción para ayudar a dar suministro a los países en desarrollo. Se estima que el desabastecimiento global hasta 2022 oscila entre 500 millones y 4.000 millones de dosis, dependiendo de cuántas otras vacunas lleguen al mercado. “El gobierno de Estados Unidos ha jugado un papel considerable para hacer de Moderna la empresa que es”, dijo David Kessler, director del programa estadounidense para acelerar el desarrollo de vacunas contra el COVID-19. Kessler no aclaró hasta donde llegaría el gobierno en sus presiones sobre la empresa. “Entienden que esperamos que ocurra”, dijo. Moderna ha prometido construir una fábrica de vacunas en África en algún momento del futuro. Pero tras pedir a las farmacéuticas que compartan sus recetas, materias primas y conocimientos tecnológicos, algunos países más pobres están hartos de esperar. La directora gerente de Afrigen, Petro Terblanche, dijo que la compañía de Ciudad del Cabo aspira a tener una versión de la vacuna de Moderna lista para hacer ensayos en humanos en un año y pasar a la producción comercial poco después. “Tenemos mucha competencia de las grandes farmacéuticas. No quieren vernos tener éxito”, dijo Terblanche. “Ya empiezan a decir que no tenemos la capacidad de hacer esto. Vamos a demostrárselo”. Si el equipo sudafricano tiene éxito en hacer una versión de la vacuna de Moderna, la información se publicará para que otros puedan utilizarla, dijo Terblanche. Ese plan está más cerca de la estrategia que defendió Biden en primavera y a la que la industria farmacéutica se opone con firmeza. La producción comercial está en un punto en el que la propiedad intelectual podría convertirse en un problema.

The country administered 2.245 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines as of Saturday, official data showed. China is giving booster shots to adults whose last dose was at least six months earlier, with priority groups including essential workers, older people and those with weaker immune systems. Data showed antibodies elicited by vaccines, including the most-used shots from Sinovac and Sinopharm, declined within months. Wang Huaqing, chief expert for the immunization program at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said China would not keep giving people booster shots after booster shots. “We hope that an ideal vaccine works well with the full doses of immunization,” Wang told the briefing. “Even if it needs to be strengthened later, the number of boosters is limited,” Wang said. “We hope in the future there will be better vaccines and better vaccination procedures to achieve solid protection among the public.” China has largely contained the virus in most areas, and the sporadic local outbreaks are tiny compared with those seen in other countries. However, Mi cautioned on Sunday there is increasing risk that China’s latest outbreak, involving over 100 infections in a week across 11 provincial areas, will spread further.

Health Secretary Sajid Javid will tell NHS leaders to allow a third shot five months after a second dose instead of six as he aims to protect people from coronavirus this winter, The Mail on Sunday reported. Earlier this week, he urged eligible people to get a booster jab and the flu vaccine as he warned cases could hit 100,000 a day this winter. But at the moment, those eligible for a booster jab cannot book in advance and must wait an average of 18 days after the six months to get an appointment for a third vaccination. This is one of the reasons only approximately 4.5 million out of the 9.3 million people who qualify for the booster have received one, The Mail on Sunday added. The newspaper said Government sources had promised the new rules would be put in place as soon as possible, allowing eligible people to book a month in advance.

The PM said vaccines would get the country through the winter and out of the pandemic, while NHS England’s national medical director Professor Stephen Powis said getting a booster will “protect the freedom and Christmas that we have all earned”.

"Lachine Rapids where Montreal firefighter died have a long, dangerous history",https://lethbridgenewsnow.com/2021/10/24/lachine-rapids-where-montreal-firefighter-died-have-a-long-dangerous-history/,,,,MONTREAL - The stretch of the St. Lawrence River where a Montreal firefighter died during a rescue last week has been known for centuries as one of th...,"MONTREAL — The stretch of the St. Lawrence River where a Montreal firefighter died during a rescue last week has been known for centuries as one of the city’s most treacherous. Today, the Lachine Rapids are mostly an attraction for surfers, sport kayakers and riverside picnickers, but the death of 58-year-old Pierre Lacroix is a reminder that Montreal owes its very existence to their dangerous nature. Lacroix was one of four firefighters who were on a boat that capsized last Sunday night while trying to help a couple in another boat in distress. While the others were all rescued, Lacroix died after becoming trapped under the boat. Louise Desrosiers, a spokeswoman for the Montreal fire department, said rescue boats typically avoid venturing into the fast-moving current of the rapids. “It’s a sector that’s dangerous, so boats will go upstream to save people or downstream to recuperate people who have passed through the rapids,” she said in a phone interview. Desrosiers says eight fire stations have nautical rescue units, all staffed by specially trained employees. Calls for help are initially categorized as either “engine trouble” or the more serious “maritime emergency,” which usually happens when someone is in the water or in immediate danger. While the boaters in the incident involving Lacroix had first reported an engine stall, Desrosiers said she couldn’t confirm how the call had been categorized. An investigation into his death remains ongoing. Michel Martin, a prevention officer with the Canadian Coast Guard Auxiliary, describes the rapids as “unforgiving” and “a trap.” Since he began with the service in 2014, he said he’s seen more and more boaters, paddle boarders and fishermen out on the water – some of them inexperienced or unaware when they first start getting caught in the current. He said the auxiliary coast boats, like the fire rescue, don’t venture into the rapids because the boats aren’t designed for the conditions he describes as rocky and unpredictable, with fast-moving water that varies from a third of a metre to three metres deep. “We’ll do everything to help people in distress, but not at the expense of the life of our members,” he said in a phone interview. Lacroix is far from the first person to lose his life in the dangerous waters of the rapids. For better or worse, the rushing waters have shaped the city’s existence from its earliest days, according to historian Denis Gravel. “Montreal wouldn’t be Montreal without the rapids,” said Gravel, who specializes in municipal history.

Today, the Lachine Rapids are mostly an attraction for surfers, sport kayakers and riverside picnickers, but the death of 58-year-old Pierre Lacroix is a reminder that Montreal owes its very existence to their dangerous nature. Lacroix was one of four firefighters who were on a boat that capsized last Sunday night while trying to help a couple in another boat in distress. While the others were all rescued, Lacroix died after becoming trapped under the boat. Louise Desrosiers, a spokeswoman for the Montreal fire department, said rescue boats typically avoid venturing into the fast-moving current of the rapids. “It’s a sector that’s dangerous, so boats will go upstream to save people or downstream to recuperate people who have passed through the rapids,” she said in a phone interview. Desrosiers says eight fire stations have nautical rescue units, all staffed by specially trained employees. Calls for help are initially categorized as either “engine trouble” or the more serious “maritime emergency,” which usually happens when someone is in the water or in immediate danger. While the boaters in the incident involving Lacroix had first reported an engine stall, Desrosiers said she couldn’t confirm how the call had been categorized. An investigation into his death remains ongoing. Michel Martin, a prevention officer with the Canadian Coast Guard Auxiliary, describes the rapids as “unforgiving” and “a trap.” Since he began with the service in 2014, he said he’s seen more and more boaters, paddle boarders and fishermen out on the water – some of them inexperienced or unaware when they first start getting caught in the current. He said the auxiliary coast boats, like the fire rescue, don’t venture into the rapids because the boats aren’t designed for the conditions he describes as rocky and unpredictable, with fast-moving water that varies from a third of a metre to three metres deep. “We’ll do everything to help people in distress, but not at the expense of the life of our members,” he said in a phone interview. Lacroix is far from the first person to lose his life in the dangerous waters of the rapids. For better or worse, the rushing waters have shaped the city’s existence from its earliest days, according to historian Denis Gravel. “Montreal wouldn’t be Montreal without the rapids,” said Gravel, who specializes in municipal history.

KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 26 — Malaysia fully supports the decision made by the Asean Chair, Brunei, on the issue of representation from Myanmar at the 38th and 39th Asean Summit and Related Summits, said Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob.He said this in his Twitter posting regarding Malaysia’s statement at the three-day summits beginning Tuesday under the chairmanship of Brunei via virtual conference.During the Asean foreign ministers’ online meeting on Oct 15, the regional bloc took a bold step to exclude Myanmar’s junta from the summits and also shot down the request by Myanmar’s shadow government, the National Unity Government (NUJ), to join the summits.The grouping instead decided to invite a non-political representative to represent the country.Since the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi was overthrown by the junta on Feb 1, there has been internal unrest in Myanmar with nearly 1,000 civilians killed by security forces.During the 38th Asean Summit, Ismail Sabri also touched on the Covid-19 pandemic, urging Asean to enhance cooperation with like-minded countries and relevant international organisations towards ensuring that vaccines were affordable, accessible and equitably shared for all as well as prioritising engagement in health diplomacy through greater collaboration.Meanwhile, he said the High Level Task Force (HLTF) on the Asean Community Post-2025 Vision is to prepare Asean to be more agile in dealing with challenges and adapting to changes.He pointed out that the regional grouping should identify measures to make way for Asean to work more efficiently and effectively with optimum utilisation of resources.“Include opportunities derived from the experience and lessons from the pandemic,” he said.Meanwhile, on the 39th Asean Summit, he said Malaysia urged Myanmar to continue with efforts in delivering its commitment to begin and ensure effective repatriation of the refugees and protect the human rights of the returnees.He stated that Malaysia also firmly holds that matters relating to the South China Sea must be resolved peacefully and constructively, in accordance with universally recognised principles of international law, including the United Nations Convention on The Law of The Sea (UNCLOS).Malaysia also remains strongly committed to ratifying the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) by the end of this year as it will help expedite regional recovery as well as resilience. — Bernama",2021-10-26 06:09:07,,,malaymail,True,"[('Datuk Seri', 'PERSON'), ('Ismail Sabri Yaakob', 'PERSON'), ('the High Level Task Force', 'ORG'), ('the Asean Community Post-2025 Vision', 'ORG'), ('Asean', 'ORG'), ('Instagram', 'ORG'), ('Telegram', 'ORG'), ('KUALA LUMPUR', 'GPE'), ('Oct 26', 'DATE'), ('Malaysia', 'GPE'), ('the Asean Chair', 'ORG'), ('Brunei', 'GPE'), ('Myanmar', 'GPE'), ('the 38th', 'DATE'), ('39th', 'ORDINAL'), ('Related Summits', 'PERSON'), ('Datuk Seri', 'PERSON'), ('Ismail Sabri Yaakob', 'PERSON'), ('Malaysia', 'GPE'), ('three-day', 'DATE'), ('Tuesday', 'DATE'), ('Brunei', 'GPE'), ('Asean', 'NORP'), ('Oct 15', 'DATE'), ('Myanmar', 'GPE'), ('Myanmar', 'GPE'), ('the National Unity Government', 'ORG'), ('NUJ', 'ORG'), ('Aung San Suu Kyi', 'ORG'), ('Feb 1', 'DATE'), ('Myanmar', 'GPE'), ('nearly 1,000', 'CARDINAL'), ('38th', 'ORDINAL'), ('Ismail Sabri', 'PERSON'), ('Asean', 'ORG'), ('the High Level Task Force', 'ORG'), ('the Asean Community Post-2025 Vision', 'ORG'), ('Asean', 'ORG'), ('Asean', 'ORG'), ('the 39th Asean Summit', 'ORG'), ('Malaysia', 'GPE'), ('Myanmar', 'GPE'), ('Malaysia', 'GPE'), ('the South China Sea', 'LOC'), ('the United Nations Convention', 'ORG'), ('UNCLOS).Malaysia', 'PERSON'), ('the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership', 'ORG'), ('the end of this year', 'DATE')]"

The legislation proposed in Ontario Monday requires companies with more than 25 employees to develop policies that promote disconnecting from work, making it easier to create and maintain boundaries, eliminating some of the pressure to respond to every text, email, Slack notification, or Zoom invite that pops up on an employee’s smartphone. It’s a first-of-its-kind proposition in this country. France pioneered this legislation in 2016 after a study found 37 per cent of workers were using their work phones or laptops outside of business hours and that 62 per cent of workers wanted to see this regulated. It's something many struggle with – disconnecting from work. The Ford govt says worker protections are on the way that could see employees stressing less about emails when they're off the clock – dubbing it the 'right to disconnect' legislation. @CityNewsVAN #CityNewsEverywhere pic.twitter.com/Ycd64UoUC0 — Tarnjit Kaur Parmar (@Tarnjitkparmar) October 26, 2021 Policies can include expectations around response time for emails, clearly defining what working hours are, and encouraging employees to turn on out-of-office notifications when they aren’t on the clock. RELATED: ‘Right to disconnect’ bill to promote work-life balance: Ontario labour minister The idea has been touted as something that could create more equitable workplace opportunities, reduce burnout, and help companies retain workers, according to Fiona McQuarrie, retired professor of business administration at the University of the Fraser Valley. “The idea has come up because the ways that we can do work now are more wide-ranging than just coming into an office and sitting down at nine o’clock and then getting up and leaving at five o’clock,” she explains, noting the notion of work-life balance became more widely discussed decades ago with the advent of email and cell phones. “Before there were all these different ways to contact workers, to have people work outside of working hours or outside of the physical workplace, there was a much stronger disconnect between the workplace and home life. I think the idea behind the “right to disconnect” is to try to bring that back in some form, to re-establish some boundaries between work and home because of the psychological importance of that division.” Not all workers equally able to be available during off hours But while everyone may feel the pressure to be constantly available, McQuarrie notes not all people have the same demands on their time or the same technology available after hours. “If everybody is operating on the same expectation — that work ends when work hours end — it could be quite effective in making a more equitable workplace,” she explains. “If that expectation is established of people being available beyond regular work hours or even 24/7, obviously that privileges certain people who don’t have commitments outside of work like families, or elders or children to take care of or other commitments. So it would even the playing field a bit more, for sure.” Even if the expectation of off-hours availability isn’t explicit, it can easily creep in, McQuarrie says. For example, if someone replies to an email while eating dinner, then someone else sends an answer to that before they go to bed, then another colleague chimes in first thing in the morning — the overall effect is a workplace that is communicating constantly. “One thing that putting in the right to disconnect would help cut down on, is to stop those cycles of responses and information being exchanged. They kind of build on each other and end up building a culture of availability even if consciously, that was not what was intended.” RELATED: Finding right balance with remote work can reduce burnout, experts say Another thing to consider, according to McQuarrie, is that a workplace with employees who never stop working isn’t necessarily more productive. She points to one study done with consultants as an example. “Workers were more satisfied, they were more productive because they were more focused, and also because they had time to do other things. Being available 24/7 theoretically is great, but if all you’re thinking about is work eventually — that catches up with you. We need to do different things in our lives we need to have different experiences and we need a break,” she explains. “Putting in the requirement that work would be done within these hours but not outside those hours, turned out also to have really good benefits for the organization. It helped them reduce their turnover and it helped to retain employees longer.” RELATED: Working mothers feeling the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic stress, fatigue, burnout The pandemic sent swaths of office workers home, while making work even more taxing for so many working in essential services. McQuarrie says this has and will continue to transform the way we think about work as the economy recovers. “We’re going through a phase where some very fundamental assumptions about work have been challenged,” she says. “We found out that there are some jobs that you can’t do from home. We’ve also found out that if you’re working from home, and your computer is sitting on your dining room table and you can see it every minute you’re awake, that’s kind of overwhelming for some people and it’s not healthy for them.” Related Video: The federal government is considering giving federally regulated employees the right to disconnect and had a consultation earlier this year. No legislation has been proposed yet. One of the key reasons the consultation was being done was due to the pandemic. “Recent surveys have shown that workers have been adapting to this new way of working. However, many workers have reported increased issues with ‘switching off’ at the end of the workday. Expectations about being able to disconnect at the end of the day are more important than ever. This is due to the fact more and more Canadians are making their home their workplace,” a backgrounder on the issue reads. For McQuarrrie, improving working conditions for people in low-paid jobs is paramount. “There are more fundamental issues that need to be addressed in labour legislation like more paid sick leave,” she says, noting Ontario has not committed to giving workers time off, or raised the minimum wage. “Something like the right to disconnect in labour legislation, it certainly could be a very positive thing, but if people are still being paid substandard wages and being exploited by their employers — the right to disconnect is kind of window dressing.”",2021-10-26 05:42:08,,https://vancouver.citynews.ca/wp-content/blogs.dir/sites/9/2015/06/17/iStock_000021823117Large-e1434561783140-1024x579.jpg,citynews1130,True,"[('Ontario', 'GPE'), ('European', 'NORP'), ('Ontario', 'GPE'), ('Monday', 'DATE'), ('more than 25', 'CARDINAL'), ('Slack', 'ORG'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('France', 'GPE'), ('2016', 'DATE'), ('37 per cent', 'MONEY'), ('62 per cent', 'MONEY'), ('Ford', 'ORG'), ('Kaur Parmar', 'PERSON'), ('@Tarnjitkparmar', 'GPE'), ('October 26, 2021', 'DATE'), ('working hours', 'TIME'), ('Fiona McQuarrie', 'PERSON'), ('the University of the Fraser Valley', 'ORG'), ('nine o’clock', 'TIME'), ('five o’clock', 'TIME'), ('decades ago', 'DATE'), ('working hours', 'TIME'), ('hours', 'TIME'), ('McQuarrie', 'PERSON'), ('hours', 'TIME'), ('hours', 'TIME'), ('regular work hours', 'TIME'), ('McQuarrie', 'PERSON'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('the morning', 'TIME'), ('One', 'CARDINAL'), ('McQuarrie', 'PERSON'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('these hours', 'TIME'), ('those hours', 'TIME'), ('COVID-19', 'ORG'), ('McQuarrie', 'PERSON'), ('earlier this year', 'DATE'), ('One', 'CARDINAL'), ('the end of the day', 'DATE'), ('Canadians', 'NORP'), ('McQuarrrie', 'PERSON'), ('Ontario', 'GPE')]"
15 common recycling myths debunked,https://metro.co.uk/2021/10/26/15-common-recycling-myths-debunked-15450967/,"['Lifestyle', 'Climate Change', 'Environment']",['Evelyn Richards'],,To bin or not to bin.,"Errors can mean that your environmental efforts aren’t the only things going to waste. (Picture: Getty) Metro.co.uk‘s Just1Change campaign is encouraging readers to realise the small changes they can make to help save the planet. Recycling is an effortless way to ensure that you’re reducing your waste as much as possible – as long as you do it properly. Despite hauling our wheelie bins out every week, many of us are still making critical mistakes that mean our environmental efforts aren’t the only things going to waste. Here are the most common recycling errors explained, and eco-friendly myths debunked. You need to separate your recycling Answer: It depends. The rules on organising recycling vary from council to council (Picture: Getty) Whether or not your recycling needs to be separated into plastics, metals, paper, and glass is dependent on where you live. Some refuse collection vehicles (RCVs) have separate compartments close together within the vehicle – this makes it easier for the items to be processed at recycling centres. However, some councils use RCVs that combine all the recycling into one, and then they are separated by hand at the centre. Use the government’s postcode checker to find out what the rules are for your area. You can’t recycle face masks Answer: False. Face masks can actually be recycled (Picture: Flo Rols/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty) What was once a coveted rarity now litters our streets – the surge of single-use face masks is an environmental nightmare in the making. Fortunately, you can recycle your face masks at special collection bins located in 150 Wilko stores nationwide. Wilko estimates that a huge 400,000 masks could be recycled via the scheme. This equates to a whopping 966kg of single-use plastic. Find your nearest Wilko face mask recycling bin on the Wilko website. You will also find the recycling bins at 438 Morrison’s stores nationwide The full list of participating Morrison’s stores can be found on the ReWorked website – they are the company that recycle the masks. Once full, collection bins are taken away by ReWorked, where – after a 72-hour quarantine period – masks are washed and shredded down into raw materials, which can be manufactured into new products. You can’t recycle crisp packets Answer: False. These salty snacks can be recycled (Picture: Getty) Whether you snack on salt and vinegar or prefer a prawn cocktail, you can actually recycle your empty crisp packets. Although the packets should not be put in your recycling bin at home, you can pop them in one of Walkers’ 1,600 public drop-off locations nationwide. There is a drop-off location within four miles of 80% of UK households – find your local one on the Walkers’ website.  The packets will be cleaned, shredded, and turned into small pellets which will be converted into plastic items. Any brand of crisp packets – not just Walkers – will be accepted. However, Pringles lovers will have to take their empty cans to a Bring Bank – find your nearest drop-off location on the Pringles’ website. You can recycle wrapping paper Answer: It depends. Try to avoid shiny, glittery, and brightly-coloured paper (Picture: Getty) Wrapping paper can be recycled in the UK – but it has to be a certain type of paper. While it is best to check with your local council or recycling scheme if they accept wrapping paper or not, some guidelines for checking if the wrapping paper you are using can be recycled are as follows: Avoid wrapping paper that is very thin as this contains very few good quality fibres and often cannot be recycledRecycle Now say that wrapping paper can only be recycled if it passes the ‘scrunch test’, which essentially means if the wrapping can be scrunched up in a paper ball (and if it stays that way) then it more than likely will be widely recyclableThe simpler your chosen paper, the better. Brown paper is one of the best, followed by plain paper colours that are not shiny. This is because simple wrapping paper that is good quality can be recycled, whereas shiny foil or glitter-decorated paper cannotAvoid wrapping paper that is heavily dyed, laminated, decorated in gold or silver patterns, coloured shapes, any type of glitter The wrapping paper packaging should also have some information on it as to whether the paper can be recycled. There are also plenty of companies that sell recyclable, or even compostable wrapping paper – including The Doodle Factory, Re-wrapped, and Paperchase. You can’t recycle pizza boxes Answer: True. Greasy cardboard cannot be recycled (Picture: Getty) Don’t put greasy pizza boxes, takeaway boxes, or other cardboard or paper covered in food into the recycling. The grease can’t be removed and it causes defects in new products made from recycled cardboard. Recycle Now says that pizza boxes should be chucked in the general bin and not in green ones. Want a low-waste pizza pie? Try making your own at home. You shouldn’t crush cans Answer: It depends. Not everyone is allowed to crush their cans (Picture: Getty) Despite the fact that crushing cans with your bare hands is oddly satisfying – you should avoid it if you want a chance of your empty drink being recycled. Sean Pettitt, the director of Purely Waste Solutions, previously explained to Metro.co.uk: ‘If you put all of your recyclables in the same bin which then goes to a materials recovery facility to be segregated, it can make it harder for a squashed can to be separated. ‘The reason for this is that it is easier for equipment to sort intact aluminium cans due to the larger surface area of the material for the eddy current separator to detect. The same applies to the steel cans for the magnet to remove this material in the process.’ But there’s a caveat – if your recycling is separated from the get-go, with cans placed in a separate bin or bag to plastic and paper, then crushing your cans is totally fine. In fact, says Sean, ‘it would be beneficial to crush the cans to save space, to get more material in a container and make transportation more efficient.’ If you’re unsure as to whether or not you can crush your can, it is safer to leave it uncrushed. You need to wash recycling Answer: True. You can contaminate the whole load by not rinsing out your recycling (Picture: Getty) Though it means extra effort on your part, washing your recycling is integral to making sure it actually gets recycled. By not washing your recycling, you run the risk of ruining everything, and diverting the whole recycling load – not just yours – to landfill. A spokesperson for North London Waste Authority previously explained to Metro.co.uk: ‘Food residue is a form of contamination because food residue left on containers cannot be reliably processed. ‘Contamination is created when the wrong materials are put into the system (e.g. nappies in the recycling bin) or when the right materials are prepared in the wrong way (e.g. food left in containers). ‘If contamination levels are too high when a recycling load arrives at the facility, it might have to be rejected.  If this is the case, then the whole load is sent to be burnt for energy or to landfill.’ Putting non-recycles in the recycling bin will contaminate everything Answer: True. If in doubt, leave it out. (Picture: Getty) Have you ever been unsure if something is recyclable, and so decide to put it in the recycling bin ‘to be safe’? Although you have the best intentions, improper recycling has consequences for the whole waste management system. Any materials put in a recycling bin which can’t be recycled are called contaminants. Not only can contaminants damage the equipment, but if a collection crew notices a contaminant in amongst the recycling, the whole contents of the container will be collected as refuse and sent for disposal rather than being recycled – meaning it ends up in landfill. If contamination isn’t noticed until large amounts are seen when the vehicle is emptied, the entire truckload may have to be sent for disposal. In March, the Local Government Association revealed that over half a million tonnes of recycling is rejected – this is mainly down to contamination. If you’re not sure if, how or where you can recycle an item, use the Recycle Now ‘What To Do With’ tool to find out. Remember: if in doubt, leave it out. You need to remove plastic tape from packaging Answer: True. The Covid-19 pandemic changed the shopping game forever, with more and more of us defaulting to buying online rather than on the high street. The result? A heck of a lot more packaging. Although cardboard boxes are fully recyclable, sticky tape is not and should be thrown away in your rubbish bin. Where possible, try to remove all loose strands of sticky tape from cardboard boxes and wrapping paper before you recycle them. Leaving the adhesive tape on your boxes could result in them becoming contaminated, and sent to a landfill rather than to a recycling centre. Broken glass can be recycled Answer: It depends. Broken glass can pose as a risk to workers (Picture: Getty) Broken glass can sometimes be recycled, but councils often won’t accept it in a kerbside bin, as it risks injuring workers. You might need to take it to a bottle bank or local recycling centre. You should check your local council’s website to find out how they recommend disposing of broken glass. It is worth noting that the following types of glass also cannot be recycled: Glass panes Toughened glass panes Mirrors Light bulbs or fluorescent tubes The above must be placed in your regular waste bin, or to Take large pieces of broken glass to your nearest Household Recycling Centre. {""@context"":""https:\/\/schema.org"",""@type"":""VideoObject"",""name"":""Metro.co.uk"",""duration"":""T3M16S"",""thumbnailUrl"":""https:\/\/i.dailymail.co.uk\/1s\/2021\/09\/22\/12\/48240903-0-image-a-10_1632310642427.jpg"",""uploadDate"":""2021-09-22T12:32:51+0100"",""description"":""Pensioners Jane and Vic Shoulders say their once 'show home' was left littered with hundreds of bags of rubbish, a collapsed ceiling, broken children's toys, hundreds of take away boxes and even two dead hamsters after claiming their nightmare tenant moved into the property in January 2020 but paid just one month's rent."",""contentUrl"":""https:\/\/videos.metro.co.uk\/video\/met\/2021\/09\/22\/288650398212833564\/480x270_MP4_288650398212833564.mp4"",""height"":270,""width"":480} To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Aerosol cans can’t be recycled Answer: False. Aerosol cans must be empty before being recycled (Picture: Getty) Aerosol cans can be recycled using your recycling bins or bags – so long as they are empty. Ensure you check that your cans of deodorant, furniture polish, air fresheners are totally empty before popping them in your recycling bin. Soft plastic can’t be recycled Answer: (Largely) False. You can recycle your shopping bags (Picture: Getty) Soft plastics are lightweight plastics that often cannot be placed in recycling bins at home. This includes plastic shopping bags, yoghurt lids, and food wrappers. Some types of soft plastic can be recycled at carrier bag collection points at the larger stores of major supermarkets such as the Co-Operative and Sainsbury’s. Larger stores of major supermarkets accept: All plastic bags, except biodegradable or compostable bagsBread bagsBreakfast cereal linersBubble wrapDelivery bagsDry cleaning bagsFrozen food bagsMagazine and newspaper wrappersMulti-pack wrappingPlastic marked as low-density polyethylene (LDPE) – resin ID code 4Toilet roll wrapping Selected stores of major supermarkets also accept: Baby, pet food, detergent and cleaning pouchesBiscuits and chocolate wrappingCheese, fish and meat wrappingCling filmCrisp and sweet bagsPlastic film lidsSalad, pasta, and rice bags Find your nearest soft plastic collection point using Recycle Now’s postcode checker. Shredded paper can’t be recycled Answer: True. Shredded paper is too small to be processed (Picture: Getty) This may seem counter-intuitive, but shredded paper cannot always be recycled. Many paper mills won’t accept it as shredded pieces are too small to be collected through the Materials Recycling Facility (MFR). London Recycles suggests disposing of shredded paper by one of the following methods: Take it to a paper bankAdd it to your home compost; No coloured or glossy paper which can contain chemicals that are harmful to plantsPlace some in the bottom of your food waste recycling bin to soak up any liquid and help prevent dripping (again no coloured or glossy paper)Throw in your rubbish bin Paper towels and tissues are recyclable Answer: False. Tissues can’t be recycled (Picture: Getty) The cardboard inner tube of kitchen rolls and boxes of tissues is widely collected as part of household recycling schemes. However, of the time, kitchen rolls and tissues aren’t suitable for recycling. This is because kitchen rolls may be contaminated with food waste, meaning that they are classed as contaminants. As mentioned before, contaminants can cause the whole recycling load to be sent to landfill. Used sheets of kitchen roll should be placed in your rubbish bin unless you council tells you otherwise. Some will allow you to put a small amount of kitchen towel in the food waste bin – check with your local authority in the first instance. Tissues can’t be recycled as they are made of very short fibres which are not high enough quality to be recycled. They will need to be disposed of in your waste bin. Lastly, recycling is a waste of time Answer: False. Recycling can help protect the world of tomorrow, today (Picture: Jeff Overs/BBC News & Current Affairs via Getty Images) Although recycling isn’t a perfect process (yet), it is far better for humans, animals, and the planet than the alternative. Recycling plays a major role in reducing the amount of waste being burned in incinerator plants or being deposited in landfills. If we didn’t recycle, then the waste materials would just decompose and produce dangerous chemicals and pollute the environment for many years to come. Also, resources such as oil and precious metals are finite, and so will one day run out. Through recycling, many of these natural resources are being conserved for future use. Additionally, recycling has a positive impact on the economy. Dumping 10,000 tons of waste in a landfill creates six jobs while recycling 10,000 tons of waste creates 36 jobs, RReuse.org claims.

You should check your local council’s website to find out how they recommend disposing of broken glass. It is worth noting that the following types of glass also cannot be recycled: The above must be placed in your regular waste bin, or to Take large pieces of broken glass to your nearest Household Recycling Centre.

Ensure you check that your cans of deodorant, furniture polish, air fresheners are totally empty before popping them in your recycling bin. Soft plastics are lightweight plastics that often cannot be placed in recycling bins at home. This includes plastic shopping bags, yoghurt lids, and food wrappers. Some types of soft plastic can be recycled at carrier bag collection points at the larger stores of major supermarkets such as the Co-Operative and Sainsbury’s. Larger stores of major supermarkets accept: Selected stores of major supermarkets also accept: Find your nearest soft plastic collection point using Recycle Now’s postcode checker . This may seem counter-intuitive, but shredded paper cannot always be recycled. Many paper mills won’t accept it as shredded pieces are too small to be collected through the Materials Recycling Facility (MFR). London Recycles suggests disposing of shredded paper by one of the following methods: The cardboard inner tube of kitchen rolls and boxes of tissues is widely collected as part of household recycling schemes. However, of the time, kitchen rolls and tissues aren’t suitable for recycling. This is because kitchen rolls may be contaminated with food waste, meaning that they are classed as contaminants. As mentioned before, contaminants can cause the whole recycling load to be sent to landfill. Used sheets of kitchen roll should be placed in your rubbish bin unless you council tells you otherwise. Some will allow you to put a small amount of kitchen towel in the food waste bin – check with your local authority in the first instance. Tissues can’t be recycled as they are made of very short fibres which are not high enough quality to be recycled. They will need to be disposed of in your waste bin. Although recycling isn’t a perfect process (yet), it is far better for humans, animals, and the planet than the alternative. Recycling plays a major role in reducing the amount of waste being burned in incinerator plants or being deposited in landfills. If we didn’t recycle, then the waste materials would just decompose and produce dangerous chemicals and pollute the environment for many years to come. Also, resources such as oil and precious metals are finite, and so will one day run out. Through recycling, many of these natural resources are being conserved for future use. Additionally, recycling has a positive impact on the economy. Dumping 10,000 tons of waste in a landfill creates six jobs while recycling 10,000 tons of waste creates 36 jobs, RReuse.org claims.

New headache for Beijing?,https://www.sentinelassam.com/international/new-headache-for-beijing-560486,"['International News,More']",['Sentinel Digital Desk'],,The misbehaviour of Chinese companies to local employees is fueling anti-China sentiments in Zimbabwe. It became evident after two blasts shook Zimbabwe’s Mazowe district late last week. The two gas explosions left eight people dead including six Chinese nationals. The police is investigating the cause of explosion.,"NEW DELHI: The misbehaviour of Chinese companies to local employees is fueling anti-China sentiments in Zimbabwe. It became evident after two blasts shook Zimbabwe's Mazowe district late last week. The two gas explosions left eight people dead including six Chinese nationals. The police is investigating the cause of explosion.The incident happened at the mine about 50 km (30 miles) north of the capital, Harare, police said. While villagers mourned the death of a local but had no sympathy for the Chinese nationals. It was reported that villagers from around SAS Mine in Mazowe expressed joy following the death of six Chinese nationals who were managers at the site. The villagers described the late Chinese managers as 'stubborn' and very dis-respectful who ill-treated locals. The local news website reported that the local councillor Taera Tapererwa, from Mazowe South Ward 2 confirmed that the Chinese managers were quite rude to the employees. A worker at the mine reportedly told that Chinese managers had ignored warnings. Nor did they show any remorse over the death of the first victim. The second explosion took lives of six Chinese and that was when it was accepted that the situation was dangerous at the mine. Available reports suggest that there is a fear among the locals that China would take away their assets if Zimbabwe fails to return loan amount. China has done heavy investment by providing huge loans to Zimbabwe. Local newspapers have reported from time to time that Chinese companies have been ill treating local labour and not paying respectable wages. An incident was reported where local employees were shot dead by a Chinese employer at a mine when the labourers demanded their legitimate outstanding wages. There have been several incidents where Chinese company owners have not paid any heed to Zimbabwean law, the citizens' legal rights and instead discriminated against them from the onsite Chinese miners by paying them low wages of merely 35 US dollars per month. Also there have been cases where Chinese employers have assaulted local employees by forcing them to work in dangerous, inhuman, harsh, and life-threatening conditions which amount to slavery. In pandemic time too, Chinese companies have reportedly ignored Covid-19 guidelines and forced employees to stay together. In one incident, 16 employees were reportedly forced to stay in just one room. On several occasions, the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Union (ZCTU) has raised objections against the assault of local workers by Chinese employers. ZCTU has been taking up issues with Chinese companies following complaints of exploitation of local employees. In June, Chinese ceramic tiles manufacturing company Sunny Yi Feng had entered into a war of words with the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) over claims of labour rights abuse, including unsafe working and living conditions.

It became evident after two blasts shook Zimbabwe's Mazowe district late last week. The two gas explosions left eight people dead including six Chinese nationals. The police is investigating the cause of explosion. The incident happened at the mine about 50 km (30 miles) north of the capital, Harare, police said. While villagers mourned the death of a local but had no sympathy for the Chinese nationals. It was reported that villagers from around SAS Mine in Mazowe expressed joy following the death of six Chinese nationals who were managers at the site. The villagers described the late Chinese managers as 'stubborn' and very dis-respectful who ill-treated locals. The local news website reported that the local councillor Taera Tapererwa, from Mazowe South Ward 2 confirmed that the Chinese managers were quite rude to the employees. A worker at the mine reportedly told that Chinese managers had ignored warnings. Nor did they show any remorse over the death of the first victim. The second explosion took lives of six Chinese and that was when it was accepted that the situation was dangerous at the mine. Available reports suggest that there is a fear among the locals that China would take away their assets if Zimbabwe fails to return loan amount. China has done heavy investment by providing huge loans to Zimbabwe. Local newspapers have reported from time to time that Chinese companies have been ill treating local labour and not paying respectable wages. An incident was reported where local employees were shot dead by a Chinese employer at a mine when the labourers demanded their legitimate outstanding wages. There have been several incidents where Chinese company owners have not paid any heed to Zimbabwean law, the citizens' legal rights and instead discriminated against them from the onsite Chinese miners by paying them low wages of merely 35 US dollars per month. Also there have been cases where Chinese employers have assaulted local employees by forcing them to work in dangerous, inhuman, harsh, and life-threatening conditions which amount to slavery. In pandemic time too, Chinese companies have reportedly ignored Covid-19 guidelines and forced employees to stay together. In one incident, 16 employees were reportedly forced to stay in just one room. On several occasions, the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Union (ZCTU) has raised objections against the assault of local workers by Chinese employers. ZCTU has been taking up issues with Chinese companies following complaints of exploitation of local employees. In June, Chinese ceramic tiles manufacturing company Sunny Yi Feng had entered into a war of words with the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) over claims of labour rights abuse, including unsafe working and living conditions. In absence of any legal action, ZCTU had launched a social media campaign to raise awareness about the working and living conditions of the workers in the factories.

KUCHING, Oct 26 ― A Parti Sarawak Bersatu (PSB) man has called upon the state government to provide all low-income households in rural Sarawak with free Covid-19 self-test kits.In pointing this out, PSB Mulu pro tem chairman Prof Son Radu believed that there were signs of a surge in new Covid-19 cases and deaths.“Deaths from Covid-19 have remained high, in the double digits range. Equally alarming is the number of brought-in-dead (BID) cases.“There are now field hospitals, which are typically associated with war zones, in Miri, Sibu and Kuching. The one in Kuching is sponsored by Mercy Malaysia.“Sarawak’s intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacity has hit the 80 per cent occupied level. The seldom-told part of this is the ICU beds are cramped in a very limited space.“Indeed, these are not signs that anybody should be comfortable with. My fear is that Sarawak might not be able to enter into the endemic stage at any time soon, as Malaysia is expected to enter Phase 4 (of the National Recovery Plan) by next month – the stage some are referring to as the endemic stage,” said Son, who is also PSB’s potential state election candidate for Mulu.He said it did not help when Minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Dato Sri Alexander Nanta Linggi had said recently that the state’s ruling coalition, Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS), wanted to hold the 12th state election ‘before the Covid-19 vaccines’ effectiveness waned’.“In view of these things and to ensure that Sarawakians, particularly the rural-based Sarawakians, are able to both actively and effectively practise ‘intelligent living’, I urge the Sarawak government to, on the most urgent basis, provide all those in the B40 (low-income) and the lower rung of the M40 (medium-income) households with Covid-19 self-test kits.“The number of kits provided should be enough for all members of each household to administer self-test every fortnightly, until two weeks after the 12th state election is held, at the very least,” said the PSB man.Son said the endemic stage, once officially declared, would be the stage where the government had acknowledged that ‘the Covid-19 is here to stay’.In the meantime, he also appealed to the GPS-led government to not hold the next state election before the lifting of the Emergency scheduled in February next year.“Use the remaining three months to manage this pandemic well so that the 12th state election could be safely held either in February or March next year,” he added. ― Borneo Post",2021-10-26 02:10:38,,,malaymail,True,"[('PSB', 'ORG'), ('Prof Son Radu', 'PERSON'), ('Instagram', 'ORG'), ('Telegram', 'ORG'), ('Oct 26', 'DATE'), ('PSB', 'ORG'), ('PSB', 'ORG'), ('Prof Son Radu', 'PERSON'), ('BID', 'ORG'), ('Miri', 'GPE'), ('Kuching', 'GPE'), ('Kuching', 'GPE'), ('Mercy Malaysia', 'ORG'), ('ICU', 'ORG'), ('80 per cent', 'MONEY'), ('ICU', 'ORG'), ('Sarawak', 'PERSON'), ('Malaysia', 'GPE'), ('Phase 4', 'PERSON'), ('the National Recovery Plan', 'ORG'), ('next month', 'DATE'), ('Son', 'PERSON'), ('PSB', 'ORG'), ('Domestic Trade', 'ORG'), ('Dato Sri', 'PERSON'), ('Gabungan Parti Sarawak', 'PERSON'), ('12th', 'ORDINAL'), ('Sarawakians', 'NORP'), ('Sarawakians', 'NORP'), ('B40', 'ORG'), ('M40', 'PERSON'), ('two weeks', 'DATE'), ('12th', 'ORDINAL'), ('PSB', 'ORG'), ('Son', 'PERSON'), ('February next year', 'DATE'), ('the remaining three months', 'DATE'), ('12th', 'ORDINAL'), ('February', 'DATE'), ('March next year', 'DATE'), ('Borneo Post', 'PERSON')]"

The APCB prohibition is a compliance of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) order, imposing a total ban on crackers during COVID-19 pandemic in all cities and towns where the air quality falls under the ""poor and above category""; and allowing the sale and use of only green crackers in cities and towns with ""moderate"" air quality. The Supreme Court also refused to interfere with the NGT order and directed all district magistrates to ensure that prohibited firecrackers are not sold and compensation is recovered from violators. Air Quality Index of Guwahati, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on Monday was found to be in the ""moderate"" category (AQI value between 101-200) which led to APCB allowing sale and use of green crackers for two hours in the capital city on the festival days. Improving air quality has gained more prominence following outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. While air quality of moderate category causes breathing or health related discomfort among elderly, children, pregnant women, people with asthma or other lung and respiratory diseases and heart diseases, prolonged exposure to ""poor"" category air can cause breathing discomfort in healthy people too. The Indian-firecracker industry produces an estimated Rs 3,000 crore worth of firecrackers, but production declined to Rs 1,500 crore last year due to the ban. Sivakasi in Tamil Nadu accounts for around 90% of the production and over 1000 manufacturers employ about three lakh workers and provide indirect employment to about five lakh people. Ensuring the SC ban on the use of toxic chemicals in the manufacturing of firecrackers has remained a cause of worry; and, this leaves room for speculation if the firecrackers manufactured in Sivakasi are actually green.

According to an estimate by the Indian firecracker industry, such illegal and unsafe Chinese crackers account for about 40% of total firecrackers sold in India.

Children could start being vaccinated by early November,https://www.wcpo.com/news/national/fda-to-review-covid-19-vaccine-data-for-children-tuesday,,,,The FDA vaccine advisory committee is meeting Tuesday to review the effectiveness of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine in children ages five to 11.,"The Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) vaccine advisory committee is meeting Tuesday to review the effectiveness of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine in 5 to 11-year-olds.“I think the public needs to recognize that is just a first step of several that need to be undertaken before providers will actually be able to administer vaccines to this population,” said Mitch Rothholz from the American Pharmacists Association. Rothholz says after Tuesday’s meeting, the Centers for Disease Control's vaccine committee will meet on Nov. 2 and Nov. 3 before its director makes a final recommendation. “When the FDA starts its process and does its EUA authorization, the flow of supply to jurisdictions will start, but it won’t be available to providers until the final recommendation comes out of the CDC,” said Rothholz.If everything goes smoothly, Rothholz said 5 to 11-year-olds could start getting vaccinated the first weekend in November.“Access points will be there. The limitation is, is again, it’s a new vaccine supply. Getting it, it will be phased in, not at the extent that it was, a year ago where we really had a supply limitation that’s not to be expected but it’s going to take two, three weeks for it to get throughout the system,” said Rothholz.The vaccine will be available at pediatrician offices, local pharmacies and through state and local governments.There are some important differences between the vaccine adults received versus the one younger kids could get.“Whether it’s the original vaccine or the booster dose now or the first doses for kids the amounts we’re giving are really tailored to what people’s bodies need so they get a nice vigorous response and then when they see the virus they’re ready for it,” said Dr. Aaron Milstone, an infectious disease specialist with Johns Hopkins Children’s Center. Milstone said the dose for kids is about a third of what adults receive. That’s because kids' immune systems tend to respond more aggressively than adults so they don’t need as much. ""I continue to see people who are having kids come home from school and daycare and spreading it to their families and their parents. So COVID is not gone and we will continue to rely on vaccinating children and adults to get us out of this pandemic,"" said Milstone.

Utahns line up for COVID-19 booster shots,https://www.deseret.com/utah/2021/10/25/22744985/utahns-line-up-for-covid-19-booster-shots-moderna-johnson-johnson-available-pfizer,,['Lisa Riley Roche'],,,"Kelsey Wetzel, a registered nurse with Davis County Community Health, gives a COVID-19 vaccine booster shot to William Boren, Monday, Oct. 25, 2021 at the Davis Legacy Center. | Kristin Murphy, Deseret News ‘It’s extra safety,’ Kaysville woman says Retired nurse Donnagay Applonie wanted to make it clear that she and her husband, Gene, didn’t get COVID-19 booster shots Monday because they were concerned the vaccines they received in March might be losing their effectiveness against the deadly virus. “I wasn’t even worried about it,” she said, deciding the Kaysville couple should get Pfizer booster shots at the Davis County Health Department’s drive-through clinic in Farmington only after her “medical friends” suggested it would be a good idea. “I just think it’s extra safety. I’m not sure our immunity was waning or anything.” Both Donnagay and Gene Applonie, a cancer survivor who’s had heart surgery, said they’ll continue to wear masks and take other precautions after the booster shots, citing other family members hit hard by COVID-19, including a daughter-in-law who was not vaccinated and has spent weeks on oxygen. People were lined up at the drive-through clinic Monday, the first day that Moderna and Johnson & Johnson booster shots were available there in addition to Pfizer after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expanded eligibility late last Thursday. Now, coronavirus booster shots are available to many people who initially received the Moderna vaccine along with everyone who got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The CDC is also allowing anyone eligible for a booster shot to choose whichever of the three brands they prefer. “When we opened our doors we had a steady line of people for the first hour, hour and a half,” Trevor Warner, Davis County Health Department spokesman, said. The clinic, open Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays, had already administered some 13,000 Pfizer booster shots since those were approved in late September, he said. Appointments for booster shots at the Legacy Events Center are required and can be made online but Warner said they’re going fast. More than 90% of the 1,200 to 1,400 vaccine doses expected to be administered daily at the clinic are likely to be booster shots for the fully vaccinated who qualify, he said. Eligibility requirements for booster shots are based on the initial vaccine received, the two-dose Pfizer or Moderna, which use a new technology, or the single-dose Johnson & Johnson. Pfizer or Moderna booster shot requirements Received their second dose at least six months ago Are at least 65 years old OR are 18 or older AND Live in a long-term care facility OR Have a specified medical condition seen as making someone more likely to become severely ill from COVID-19, such as cancer, heart failure, stroke, diabetes, chronic kidney, liver or lung disease, obesity, pregnancy, HIV, organ transplant, smoking or substance abuse OR Work in a setting deemed high risk, such as health care, first responders, schools, correctional facilities, grocery stores, manufacturing plants, the U.S. Postal Service, homeless shelters, public transit, food and agriculture. Johnson & Johnson booster shot requirements Received their single dose at least two months ago Are 18 or older Intermountain Healthcare, the region’s largest health care provider, is offering booster shots at 74 sites throughout the state, said Lori Abeyta, a clinical specialist for Intermountain Healthcare who’s leading the COVID-19 vaccine rollout for medical clinics. “There’s tons of interest. The phones on Friday were just ringing off the hook with patients calling, wanting to get appointments to get booster shots,” Abeyta said, because “there was a lot of pent up demand for Moderna and J&J because it took longer to get those boosters approved.” Some doctors offices were able to start giving booster shots by Friday afternoon, she said, but most began on Monday. Patients are advised to contact their primary care physician about scheduling an appointment for a booster shot, which may be handled by staff or available at after-hours flu shot clinics being held in some locations. Experts say someone can safely get both a COVID-19 booster and a flu shot at the same time. If they can’t get in as soon as they’d like, or the type of vaccine they want isn’t available, Abeyta said patients are directed to the list of pharmacies, local health departments and other locations where vaccinations are available, posted on the state’s COVID-19 website, coronavirus.utah.gov, and the CDC’s vaccines.gov website. Abeyta said she hasn’t heard from doctors yet about the impact of patients being able to “mix and match” booster shots rather than sticking to the brand they initially received. A recent study suggested Pfizer and Moderna booster shots produce more benefits than Johnson and Johnson, but all increase protection against the virus. “All three brands are great products and we’d recommend patients get whichever brand is available to them,” Abeyta said. Pfizer is the most popular among doctors because the smaller vial means less potential for vaccine waste, she said, adding, “we don’t have a preference as to which one you get.” The state is beefing up its vaccine supplies to accommodate the demand for booster shots, Rich Lakin, Utah Department of Health immunization director, said. Lakin said more than 38,000 doses of Pfizer, 19,000 of Moderna and 16,500 of Johnson & Johnson have been ordered. His advice to Utahns who are anxious to get a booster shot is to be patient. “We don’t need to rush and panic,” he said, warning it may take a week or two to get an appointment as many of the first Utahns to get vaccinated scramble for booster shots. “Remember, these people are still fully vaccinated.

Biden to join ASEAN summit Trump skipped after 2017,https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/biden-join-asean-summit,,['Reuters'],,Analysts say Biden's meeting with the 10-nation bloc reflects his administration's efforts to engage allies and partners in a collective effort to push back against China,"US President Joe Biden will take part in a virtual summit with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on Tuesday, October 26, the first time in four years Washington will engage at the top level with a bloc it sees as key to its strategy of pushing back against China. The US embassy in Brunei told Reuters Biden will lead the US delegation for the ASEAN-United States summit, part of a series of ASEAN leaders’ meetings this week. The White House said Biden would discuss the “enduring” US commitment to ASEAN’s central role in regional affairs and new initiatives to strengthen the US strategic partnership with the bloc, “as we work together to end the COVID-19 pandemic, address the climate crisis, promote economic growth, and address a range of other regional challenges and opportunities.” The United States has not joined the meetings at the presidential level since Biden’s predecessor, Donald Trump, attended an ASEAN-US meeting in Manila in 2017. Analysts say Biden’s meeting with the 10-nation bloc reflects his administration’s efforts to engage allies and partners in a collective effort to push back against China. US officials, however, have not made specific mention of China in the run-up to the meeting as they work to set up a virtual summit between Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping later this year. They expect Biden to focus on collaboration on COVID-19 vaccine distribution, climate, supply chains and infrastructure. He is also expected to assure ASEAN that a recent US focus on engagement with India, Japan and Australia in the so-called Quad grouping and a deal to supply Australia with nuclear-powered submarines are not intended to supplant ASEAN’s central regional role. Edgard Kagan, senior director for East Asia at the White House National Security Council, stressed last week that Washington does not see the Quad as “an Asian NATO” and that it was not intended to compete with ASEAN. He said Washington had an interest in working with ASEAN to ensure supply-chain resilience, on climate, and to address “common challenges on maritime issues” – an apparent reference to China’s broad claims in the disputed South China Sea. “This will be Biden’s first meeting with the leaders of ASEAN as president, so he will want to assure them that Southeast Asia matters to his administration,” said Murray Hiebert, a Southeast Asia expert with Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank. Hiebert said ASEAN leaders would be anxious to hear of any US plans to step up provision of COVID-19 vaccines to the region, which has been hard hit by the pandemic, and how Washington plans to engage on trade, investment and infrastructure. Biden has given no sign of any plan to return to a regional trade framework Trump withdrew from in 2017, and an Asian diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the lack of an economic element in US regional engagement was a major gap. “The piece that is most important for the region, is the economic piece,” the diplomat said. “We’re kind of stuck in that the region says: ‘You’ve put in place a strategic sort of competitive structure with China, but this doesn’t benefit the region at all. And, meanwhile, all of us have got economic relationships growing with China.’” The ASEAN meetings will take place without Myanmar military leader Min Aung Hlaing, who overthrew a civilian government on February 1 – a rare exclusion for a grouping usually known for non-interference. Kagan called this a significant step but said more needed to be done to address the challenges Myanmar is facing. – Rappler.com",2021-10-26 00:29:47,"US President Joe Biden will take part in a virtual summit with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on Tuesday, October 26, the first time in four years Washington will engage at the top level with a bloc it sees as key to its strategy of pushing back against China.

From Oct. 7 to Oct. 20, they accounted for 77 per cent of hospitalizations. B.C. now has 29 outbreaks in health-care facilities: Long-term Care: Willingdon Care Centre, Westminster House, Magnolia Gardens, Manoah Manor, Cherington Place, West Shore Laylum, Queens Park Care Centre, Heritage Village, Valleyhaven Retirement Community (Fraser Health); Amica Lions Gate, Amica Edgemont (Vancouver Coastal Health); Cottonwoods Care Centre, Overlander, Village by the Station, Haven Hill Retirement Centre, Deni House (Interior Health); and Wrinch Memorial Hospital (Northern Health). Acute Care: Mission Memorial Hospital, Chilliwack General Hospital (Fraser Health); University Hospital of Northern BC, GR Baker Memorial Hospital and Bulkley Valley District Hospital (Northern Health). Assisted or Independent Living: Sunset Manor, Evergreen Manor, Menno Terrace West, The Emerald at Elim Village, Swedish Assisted Living Residence, Harrison Pointe and Norman Manor (Fraser Health). Capacity limits lifted for many B.C. venues On Monday, COVID-19 restrictions were further relaxed in most of B.C., with restaurants, movie theatres, performance venues, and arenas once again allowed to operate at full capacity. The easing of restrictions means guests are now allowed to mingle and do not need to stay in their seats. Venues are also now able to determine their own table limits and liquor service hours are returning to normal. There are some health rules still in place: everyone must be double vaccinated and everyone must be masked indoors. In addition, there is still no dancing allowed, which wedding planners have called disappointing and concert venues have said is confusing.

Events and certain non-essential settings in Abbotsford, Harrison Hot Springs, Boston Bar, Mission, Hope, Chilliwack, and Agassiz are only open to those who are double vaccinated, and even then, attendance is limited. In the Interior, gatherings in vacation rentals remain limited to your household plus five visitors, and weddings cannot be larger than 50 people. Travel to and from the Interior remains discouraged unless the traveller is fully vaccinated. In Northern Health, worship services must remain virtual and unvaccinated people are not allowed to attend indoor personal gatherings outside of their household. As of Sunday, anywhere where the B.C.

CREDIT: Edgardo Ayala/IPSBy Emilio GodoyMEXICO CITY, Oct 25 2021 (IPS) Latin America and the Caribbean are heading to a new climate summit with a menu of insufficient measures to address the effects of the crisis, in the midst of the impact of the covid-19 pandemic. The world’s most unequal region, which is the hardest hit by the effects of climate change and highly vulnerable to the impacts of the climate crisis, has yet to engage in the fight against this emergency head-on, according to analysts and studies. Tania Miranda, director of Policy and Stakeholder Engagement in the Environment and Climate Change Programme of the U.S.-based non-governmental Institute of the Americas, said Latin America’s high climate ambitions have not been supported by the measures necessary to reduce emissions. “Goals are aspirational. If they are not backed up with policies and financing, they remain empty promises. There is a need for financing and the implementation of strategies and public policies that will lead them to fulfill their commitments. Billions of dollars are needed,” the researcher told IPS from San Diego, California, where the Institute is based. Miranda is the author of the report “Nationally Determined Contributions Across the Americas. A Comparative Hemispheric Analysis,” which evaluates the climate targets of 16 countries, including the United States and Canada. In her study, she analyses pollutant emission reduction targets, plans for adaptation to the climate crisis, dependence on external financing, long-term carbon neutrality commitments and the state of pollution abatement. Climate policies will be the focus of the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which will take place Oct. 31 to Nov. 12 in Glasgow, Scotland in the north of the United Kingdom, after being postponed in that same month in 2020 due to the pandemic. COP26 will address rules for carbon markets, at least 100 billion dollars annually in climate finance, the gaps between nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and the necessary reductions, strategies for carbon neutrality by 2050, adaptation plans, and the local communities and indigenous peoples platform. A parallel alternative summit will also be held, bringing together social movements from around the world, advocating an early phase-out of fossil fuels, rejecting so-called “false solutions” such as carbon markets, and calling for a just energy transition and reparations for damage and redistribution of funds to indigenous communities and countries of the global South. The Glasgow conference is considered the most important climate summit, due to the need to accelerate action in the face of alarming data on global warming since the adoption of the Paris Agreement at COP21, held in December 2015 in the French capital.

CREDIT: Inés Acosta/IPS Since then, 192 signatories to the binding treaty have submitted their first NDCs. But just 13 countries worldwide sent their new climate contributions in 2020 to the UNFCCC Secretariat based in Bonn, despite calls from its secretary, Patricia Espinosa of Mexico, for all parties to the treaty to do so that year. Of these, only four from this region – Argentina, Grenada, Mexico and Suriname – submitted the second updated version of their contributions. Although they are voluntary commitments, the NDCs are a core part of the Paris Agreement, based on the goal of curbing the temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, considered the minimum and indispensable target to avoid irreversible climate disasters and, consequently, human catastrophes. In the NDCs, nations must set their goals for 2030 and 2050 to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions responsible for global warming, taking a specific year as a baseline, outline the way they will achieve these goals, establish the peak year of their emissions and when they would achieve net zero emissions, i.e. absorb as many gases as they release into the atmosphere. In addition, to contain the spread of the coronavirus and its impacts, the region has taken emergency economic decisions, such as providing support for companies of all sizes, as well as for vulnerable workers. But these post-pandemic recovery packages lack green components, such as commitments to sustainable and cleaner production. A street in Mexico City shows reduced traffic due to covid restrictions. Automotive transport is one of the largest generators of polluting emissions in Latin America and the Caribbean. But the transition to a cleaner vehicle fleet, with the increase in the number of electric vehicles and other alternatives, is moving very slowly. CREDIT: Emilio Godoy/IPS Shared irresponsibilities While some countries, such as Argentina and Chile, improved their pledges, others like Brazil and Mexico scaled down or kept their pledges unchanged. The measures of Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Colombia are in code red, as they are highly insufficient to contain global warming, according to the Climate Action Tracker. In the case of the first three, the largest Latin American economies, the governments are prioritising the financing of increased fossil fuel exploitation, which would result in a rise in emissions in 2030, the Tracker highlights. Chile’s and Peru’s measures are classified as insufficient and Costa Rica’s as almost sufficient. That Central American nation, Colombia and Peru are on track to meet their commitments by 2030 and 2050, the Tracker notes. In the case of Argentina, Chile and Ecuador, they would need additional measures to achieve their goals. At the other extreme are Brazil and Mexico, the biggest regional polluters, which have strayed from the medium- and long-term path. Enrique Maurtúa, senior climate policy advisor for the non-governmental Environment and Natural Resources Foundation (FARN), said that Argentina is an example of the countries in the region that are caught between these contradictions. “Argentina follows the line of what is happening in several countries in the region. In terms of commitments, it does its homework, what it is supposed to do, it is preparing a long-term strategy. But those commitments are not in line with what Argentina is doing behind closed doors,” the expert told IPS from Buenos Aires, where the Foundation is based. As part of this approach, the Argentine Congress is debating a draft Hydrocarbon Investment Promotion Regime to provide fiscal stability to the sector for the next 20 years. In addition, the government weakened the carbon tax, which averages a 10 dollar charge, through exemptions and the exclusion of gas, and is preparing a sustainable mobility strategy that dispenses with hydrogen. Mexico is following a similar path, as the government favours support for the state-owned oil company Pemex and the government’s electric utility Comisión Federal de Electricidad, is building a refinery in the state of Tabasco, on the southeastern coast of the country, and has stalled actions aimed at an energy transition. On Dec. 29, 2020, Mexico released its updated NDC, without increasing the emissions reduction target, to the disappointment of environmental organisations, and in contravention of the Paris Agreement and its own climate change law. But on Oct. 1 it was reported that a federal court annulled the update, considering that there was an illegal reduction in the mitigation goals, so the 2016 measures remain in force until the government improves on them. Isabel Bustamante, a member of the Fridays for Future Mexico movement who will attend COP26, questioned Mexico’s climate stance. “It does not take a solid stance. We need declarations of climate emergency throughout the country and to make resources more readily available. We are concerned about the focus on more fossil fuel production,” she told IPS from the southeastern city of Mérida. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador is facing pressure from the environmental sector, but does not seem adept at changing course. He is even sending mixed signals, such as his announcement on Oct. 18 that the country will raise climate targets in 2022. At most service stations in Brazil, consumers can choose between gasoline and ethanol, the price of which is attractive when it does not exceed 70 percent of that of gasoline. But users only opt for biofuel when it is economically attractive, so it does not contribute to alleviating the emission of polluting gases. CREDIT: Mario Osava/IPS The COP and the question marks it raises for the region The UNFCCC stated in September that the NDCs presented are insufficient to curb warming to 1.5 degrees C. Miranda believes COP26 could be beneficial for the region. “Expectations are very high. We need the big polluters to be present. There will be pressure for tangible results. The region knows where its needs are, it has many opportunities to use ecosystems to reduce emissions,” she said. Maurtúa, for his part, stresses that the main results will depend on the concrete financing and means of implementation of the Paris Agreement. “Developed countries have to make financial contributions to the transition in developing countries. Industrialised nations are asking for more ambition, but they have to provide financing,” he argued. In the expert’s opinion, “it is what the region needs. There are signs of willingness in Costa Rica, Colombia and Chile. But that is not happening in the case of Argentina or Mexico.” For young people like Bustamante, the summit needs to offer more real action and fewer empty offers. “We expect an urgent climate action agenda to emerge. We need to stop investments in fossil fuel infrastructure, which compromises our near future. We will not stop until we do,” she said. Under pressure due to the urgency of pending matters and within the constraints imposed by the pandemic, Glasgow could be a defining benchmark of a real global commitment to address the climate emergency, which is causing more and more destruction.

A group of state workers is suing Governor Jay Inslee, Spokane Fire Chief Brian Schaeffer, Washington State Patrol Chief John Batiste and others. The workers say their civil rights are being violated. The group includes Spokane firefighters, state troopers and other state employees. The plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order. U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Rice denied the motion Monday. In his ruling, Rice wrote that “The Supreme Court has long endorsed state and local government authority to impose compulsory vaccines… Federal courts have routinely analyzed such cases using rational basis and regularly reject cases similar to this one that challenge vaccine mandates based on free exercise of religion.” “Moreover, the State has a legitimate government interest in preventing the spread of COVID-19, as endorsed by the Ninth Circuit,” Rice wrote. He cited a case brought by a Chelan waterslide park, in which the state prevailed when requiring certain restrictions due to COVID-19. PAST COVERAGE: Spokane judge tosses waterpark’s lawsuit challenging legality of Inslee’s stay-home order Rice says the plaintiffs also cited modifications to their contracts as a reason for the court to step in. But, Rice writes, “Plaintiffs have not provided copies of the collective bargaining agreements at issue or stated the material provisions that have allegedly been modified.” Rice also points out that the governor’s proclamation requiring vaccines “is well-supported by extensive medical evidence, recommendations by professional organizations, and aligns with other measures already in place in other governmental settings.” The judge points out that in order for him to place this pause on the governor’s mandate, a plaintiff must show that irreparable harm is likely if he doesn’t. “It is well settled that loss of employment does not constitute irreparable harm,” he writes, citing federal precedent. He also writes that the plaintiffs filed their complaint on October 6, almost two months after the vaccination requirement was announced. That, he says, shows a lack of urgency and lack of true concern about irreparable harm. “The court finds the Plaintiffs have not carried their burden to demonstrate irreparable harm absent a restraining order,” Rice says.

Jay Inslee, right, speaks at a news conference, Wednesday, Aug. 18, 2021, at the Capitol in Olympia, Wash. Inslee announced that Washington state is expanding its vaccine mandate to include all public, charter and private school teachers and staff, as well as those working at the state's colleges and universities. The governor also expanded the statewide indoor mask mandate in place for non-vaccinated individuals to include those who are vaccinated. SPOKANE, Wash – A federal judge in Spokane has denied a motion to halt Washington’s vaccine mandate for state workers and emergency responders. A group of state workers is suing Governor Jay Inslee, Spokane Fire Chief Brian Schaeffer, Washington State Patrol Chief John Batiste and others. The workers say their civil rights are being violated. The group includes Spokane firefighters, state troopers and other state employees. The plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order. U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Rice denied the motion Monday. In his ruling, Rice wrote that “The Supreme Court has long endorsed state and local government authority to impose compulsory vaccines… Federal courts have routinely analyzed such cases using rational basis and regularly reject cases similar to this one that challenge vaccine mandates based on free exercise of religion.” “Moreover, the State has a legitimate government interest in preventing the spread of COVID-19, as endorsed by the Ninth Circuit,” Rice wrote. He cited a case brought by a Chelan waterslide park, in which the state prevailed when requiring certain restrictions due to COVID-19. PAST COVERAGE: Spokane judge tosses waterpark’s lawsuit challenging legality of Inslee’s stay-home order Rice says the plaintiffs also cited modifications to their contracts as a reason for the court to step in. But, Rice writes, “Plaintiffs have not provided copies of the collective bargaining agreements at issue or stated the material provisions that have allegedly been modified.” Rice also points out that the governor’s proclamation requiring vaccines “is well-supported by extensive medical evidence, recommendations by professional organizations, and aligns with other measures already in place in other governmental settings.” The judge points out that in order for him to place this pause on the governor’s mandate, a plaintiff must show that irreparable harm is likely if he doesn’t. “It is well settled that loss of employment does not constitute irreparable harm,” he writes, citing federal precedent. He also writes that the plaintiffs filed their complaint on October 6, almost two months after the vaccination requirement was announced. That, he says, shows a lack of urgency and lack of true concern about irreparable harm. “The court finds the Plaintiffs have not carried their burden to demonstrate irreparable harm absent a restraining order,” Rice says. Finally, Rice addresses the concern the plaintffs raise about public safety, as these troopers, firefighters and state workers lost their job over the mandate. Rice contends that “the balance of equities tips in favor of the Defendants and that the public interest would not be served by enjoining the proclamation.” The ruling serves only to deny a pause in the governor’s mandate; it does not mean the case is over.

Facebook is spending at least $10 billion this year on its metaverse division,https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745381/facebook-reality-labs-10-billion-metaverse,,['Jacob Kastrenakes'],,,"Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge Facebook plans to spend at least $10 billion this year on Facebook Reality Labs, its metaverse division tasked with creating AR and VR hardware, software, and content. “We are committed to bringing this long-term vision to life and we expect to increase our investments for the next several years,” the company writes in its third-quarter earnings release this afternoon. Facebook sees AR and VR as being core to “the next generation of online social experiences.” A sign that Reality Labs should be judged separately from Facebook’s core apps The division, which already makes the Oculus Quest headset and Portal lineup of calling devices, is clearly being positioned as the next big thing inside of Facebook. For one, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been talking about the metaverse nonstop for the past several months. And today, Facebook said it’s going to begin reporting earnings specifically for its Reality Labs segment, while Facebook’s main ads business — a staggering $28 billion this last quarter alone — will be reported under another bucket. It’s a sign to investors that the Reality Labs business matters and should be judged separately from how they value Facebook today. It’s also a move to, perhaps, distract from what else is going on in Facebook’s earnings today. The company missed revenue expectations by around $1 billion (this is not a lot, exactly, at Facebook’s scale), which speaks to some of the company’s struggles right now. Facebook blames a number of factors for this: COVID-19, the economy, and Apple’s recent ad-tracking changes — something we saw last week when Snap reported earnings, too. Apple updated iOS in April with a new privacy feature that requires users to actively opt in to allow apps to track them across other apps and websites. Initially, social media companies said they weren’t certain how much it would impact their ads businesses, which rely on that tracking in part to measure the efficacy of ads. It’s been a rough few weeks for Facebook. A series of stories in The Wall Street Journal detailed significant missteps by the company, including moderation issues and concerns about younger users’ mental health; the whistleblower who leaked those documents then testified before Congress; and just this morning, dozens of stories were published by a consortium of news outlets, including The Verge, covering even more problems for Facebook, including worries about declining usage among teens. Also, in the middle of all of that, Facebook’s apps were all down for a good chunk of a day in early October. None of that is mentioned in Facebook’s earnings release today. But it is the context behind these investments and changes. If the Facebook brand and apps are going to come with this kind of baggage, the company would like to push toward something new where, just maybe, it can escape all that.",2021-10-25 21:06:10,,,theverge,True,"[('Alex Castro', 'PERSON'), ('at least $10 billion', 'MONEY'), ('this year', 'DATE'), ('AR', 'PERSON'), ('the next several years', 'DATE'), ('third-quarter', 'DATE'), ('this afternoon', 'TIME'), ('AR', 'PERSON'), ('VR', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('Facebook’s', 'ORG'), ('Portal', 'NORP'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('Mark Zuckerberg', 'PERSON'), ('the past several months', 'DATE'), ('today', 'DATE'), ('Reality Labs', 'PRODUCT'), ('Facebook’s', 'ORG'), ('$28 billion', 'MONEY'), ('this last quarter', 'DATE'), ('today', 'DATE'), ('Facebook’s', 'ORG'), ('today', 'DATE'), ('around $1 billion', 'MONEY'), ('Facebook’s', 'ORG'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('last week', 'DATE'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('April', 'DATE'), ('few weeks', 'DATE'), ('The Wall Street Journal', 'ORG'), ('Congress', 'ORG'), ('just this morning', 'TIME'), ('dozens', 'CARDINAL'), ('Facebook’s', 'PERSON'), ('a day', 'DATE'), ('early October', 'DATE'), ('Facebook’s', 'ORG'), ('today', 'DATE'), ('Facebook', 'ORG')]"

A motion initiated by Bayern Munich club member Michael Ott has gained traction and attention ahead of the club’s upcoming annual general assembly on November 25: Ott has filed a motion that would oblige Bayern to allow its sponsorship deal with Qatar Airways (2016/17-2022/23) to expire and forbid the club to conclude further sponsoring deals with companies of which a majority is owned by the Qatari Emirate. The motion, which can be found online at http://katar-antrag.de/, reads in translation as follows: May the members’ assembly resolve: FC Bayern Munich e.V. [registered club], through exercise of all necessary legal and factional avenues at its disposal, influences FC Bayern Munich AG [corporation] to the effect that sponsoring contracts with Qatar Airways or other companies majority-owned by the Emirate of Qatar are allowed to expire and not extended or not concluded de novo. [Editor: FC Bayern e.V. is the overarching club, which is majority owner of FC Bayern AG, the corporation that comprises the original soccer branch of the club. The annual general assembly includes the entire FC Bayern, from the chess team to the soccer team.] Ott sets out the justification for the measure in five detailed points. He told Bild, “We want to take preventative measures to prevent a new contract.” The principal reason is Qatar’s history of human rights violations. Ott explains, “Qatar Airways is 100% owned by the Emirate of Qatar. This country stands for massive human rights violations, and there moreover are serious charges of corruption in sports. Instead of effecting change, FC Bayern is actively helping the Emirate of Qatar with its sponsorship to draw attention away from these evils.” With such “indifference,” Ott argues, FC Bayern damages its own reputation and “falls short of its status as an exemplary model.” The motion would not, however, preclude Bayern from traveling to its annual training camp at the Aspire Academy in Doha, Qatar. Ott said that the event provides “an opportunity for critical communication, at least in theory.” I have commented several times on Bayern Munich’s relationship with Qatar Airways over the years. Bayern first visited Qatar in 2011, not long after Qatar made its controversial, and ultimately successful, bid to host World Cup 2022.

The 26-year-old Kimmich, tipped as a future Germany captain for his leadership qualities, confirmed over the weekend that he is yet to be vaccinated against COVID-19 because of his own concerns about “a lack of long-term studies” into the effects of the vaccines. Kimmich said he was still considering it and that it was “very possible that I will get vaccinated.” His comments were welcomed by the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has consistently opposed measures against the coronavirus, while they led to dismay among those who are banking on vaccines as a route back toward normalcy at a time when infection rates are climbing again in Germany. “The more people who are vaccinated, the less dangerous the virus will be,” Leipzig’s American coach Jesse Marsch said Monday. Medical expert Alena Buyx, president of the German Ethics Council, said Kimmich is “caught up in misinformation. He is very badly advised. This is something that has now spread, and it would be great if he’d used his platform to get better advice to be a role model in this regard.” Buyx added: “It is important to clarify that these forms of long-term effects do not exist.” German government spokesman Steffen Seibert said Monday that there were “clear and convincing answers” to Kimmich’s questions from national and international experts, and that he hoped that “Kimmich lets all this information work on him and then maybe he can decide in favor of the vaccination.” Kimmich’s reluctance to get vaccinated surprised many due to his involvement in setting up the “We Kick Corona” fundraising campaign with Bayern and Germany teammate Leon Goretzka in March 2020. Together they raised millions for social and charitable organizations to continue working during the pandemic, while some of that money also went to medical associations. “We also donated to UNICEF, who made vaccines available. The point was that there are also countries that do not have access to vaccines,” Kimmich said Saturday after Bayern’s win over Hoffenheim. “I think everyone should make the decision for themselves and it cannot be that someone has no access. Because if you make the decision to do so, then you should do everything you can to ensure that they can get the vaccine.” The player denied being opposed to vaccines. “I think that’s a shame about the debate, that it’s only about being vaccinated or not vaccinated and if you’re not, then you’re automatically a COVID-denier or vaccine-opponent,” Kimmich said. “But there are other people at home, I think, who are simply having thoughts — whatever the reasons are. I think they should be respected, especially if they are sticking to the guidelines.” Neither the German soccer league nor the clubs publicize which players are vaccinated and which are not. Several have contracted the coronavirus since the pandemic began. Kimmich is almost certainly not the only Bundesliga player who isn’t vaccinated, but his stature as a Bayern and Germany leader — he captained Germany in Manuel Neuer’s absence recently — means his statements carry added weight. “As an example, but also for practical reasons, it would be better if he were vaccinated,” former Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said. Rummenigge’s successor Oliver Kahn said that Bayern’s stance as a club is that “we can only recommend to everyone to get vaccinated” but that “you also have to respect if one or another has another opinion.” Bayern coach Julian Nagelsmann is currently self-isolating at home after testing positive for COVID-19 despite being fully vaccinated. Nagelsmann is coping well with the disease and has been conveying messages to assistant coach Dino Toppmöller for the last two games. While most of last season was played without any fans at all present, this season has seen their return under stringent conditions. Most clubs are still operating under the so-called 3G rule – spectators must be vaccinated against COVID-19, have recovered from the disease, or have proof of a negative test result. But some only allow vaccinated or recovered fans to attend games. The same rule doesn’t apply to players or it would mean that Kimmich, and any others who aren’t vaccinated, would not be granted entry. Kimmich said he undergoes tests regularly, and that they are paid for by his club. Former Bayern president Uli Hoeness would not be drawn on his thoughts over Kimmich’s statements. “I have an opinion on the matter, but only for him,” Hoeness said. ___ More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports ___ Ciarán Fahey on Twitter: https://twitter.com/cfaheyAP Ciarán Fahey, The Associated Press",2021-10-25 20:17:16,"BERLIN (AP) — Bayern Munich soccer star Joshua Kimmich has found himself at the center of a debate in Germany over the merits of vaccination against the coronavirus.

This is something that has now spread, and it would be great if he’d used his platform to get better advice to be a role model in this regard.” Buyx added: “It is important to clarify that these forms of long-term effects do not exist.” German government spokesman Steffen Seibert said Monday that there were “clear and convincing answers” to Kimmich’s questions from national and international experts, and that he hoped that “Kimmich lets all this information work on him and then maybe he can decide in favor of the vaccination.” Kimmich’s reluctance to get vaccinated surprised many due to his involvement in setting up the “We Kick Corona” fundraising campaign with Bayern and Germany teammate Leon Goretzka in March 2020. Together they raised millions for social and charitable organizations to continue working during the pandemic, while some of that money also went to medical associations. “We also donated to UNICEF, who made vaccines available. The point was that there are also countries that do not have access to vaccines,” Kimmich said Saturday after Bayern’s win over Hoffenheim. “I think everyone should make the decision for themselves and it cannot be that someone has no access. Because if you make the decision to do so, then you should do everything you can to ensure that they can get the vaccine.” The player denied being opposed to vaccines. “I think that’s a shame about the debate, that it’s only about being vaccinated or not vaccinated and if you’re not, then you’re automatically a COVID-denier or vaccine-opponent,” Kimmich said. “But there are other people at home, I think, who are simply having thoughts — whatever the reasons are. I think they should be respected, especially if they are sticking to the guidelines.” Neither the German soccer league nor the clubs publicize which players are vaccinated and which are not. Several have contracted the coronavirus since the pandemic began. Kimmich is almost certainly not the only Bundesliga player who isn’t vaccinated, but his stature as a Bayern and Germany leader — he captained Germany in Manuel Neuer’s absence recently — means his statements carry added weight. “As an example, but also for practical reasons, it would be better if he were vaccinated,” former Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said. Rummenigge’s successor Oliver Kahn said that Bayern’s stance as a club is that “we can only recommend to everyone to get vaccinated” but that “you also have to respect if one or another has another opinion.” Bayern coach Julian Nagelsmann is currently self-isolating at home after testing positive for COVID-19 despite being fully vaccinated . Nagelsmann is coping well with the disease and has been conveying messages to assistant coach Dino Toppmöller for the last two games. While most of last season was played without any fans at all present, this season has seen their return under stringent conditions. Most clubs are still operating under the so-called 3G rule – spectators must be vaccinated against COVID-19, have recovered from the disease, or have proof of a negative test result. But some only allow vaccinated or recovered fans to attend games. The same rule doesn’t apply to players or it would mean that Kimmich, and any others who aren’t vaccinated, would not be granted entry. Kimmich said he undergoes tests regularly, and that they are paid for by his club. Former Bayern president Uli Hoeness would not be drawn on his thoughts over Kimmich’s statements. “I have an opinion on the matter, but only for him,” Hoeness said. ___ More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports ___ Ciarán Fahey on Twitter: https://twitter.com/cfaheyAP Ciarán Fahey, The Associated Press",https://s3.amazonaws.com/socast-superdesk/media/20211025201016/617710c2023d16089dbe794ajpeg.jpg,lethbridgenewsnow,True,"[('AP', 'ORG'), ('Bayern Munich', 'ORG'), ('Joshua Kimmich', 'PERSON'), ('Germany', 'GPE'), ('26-year-old', 'DATE'), ('Kimmich', 'PERSON'), ('Germany', 'GPE'), ('the weekend', 'DATE'), ('COVID-19', 'PERSON'), ('Kimmich', 'PERSON'), ('Germany', 'GPE'), ('Germany', 'GPE'), ('Leipzig', 'GPE'), ('American', 'NORP'), ('Jesse Marsch', 'PERSON'), ('Monday', 'DATE'), ('Alena Buyx', 'PERSON'), ('the German Ethics Council', 'ORG'), ('Kimmich', 'PERSON'), ('Buyx', 'PERSON'), ('German', 'NORP'), ('Steffen Seibert', 'PERSON'), ('Monday', 'DATE'), ('Kimmich', 'PERSON'), ('Kimmich', 'PERSON'), ('Kimmich', 'PERSON'), ('the “We Kick Corona', 'ORG'), ('Bayern', 'ORG'), ('Germany', 'GPE'), ('Leon Goretzka', 'PERSON'), ('March 2020', 'DATE'), ('millions', 'CARDINAL'), ('UNICEF', 'ORG'), ('Kimmich', 'PERSON'), ('Saturday', 'DATE'), ('Bayern', 'ORG'), ('Hoffenheim', 'GPE'), ('Kimmich', 'PERSON'), ('German', 'NORP'), ('Kimmich', 'PERSON'), ('Bundesliga', 'GPE'), ('Bayern', 'ORG'), ('Germany', 'GPE'), ('Germany', 'GPE'), ('Manuel Neuer’s', 'PERSON'), ('Bayern', 'ORG'), ('Karl-Heinz Rummenigge', 'PERSON'), ('Rummenigge', 'GPE'), ('Oliver Kahn', 'PERSON'), ('Bayern', 'ORG'), ('Julian Nagelsmann', 'PERSON'), ('COVID-19', 'ORG'), ('Nagelsmann', 'ORG'), ('Dino Toppmöller', 'PERSON'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('last season', 'DATE'), ('this season', 'DATE'), ('3', 'CARDINAL'), ('COVID-19', 'ORG'), ('Kimmich', 'PERSON'), ('Kimmich', 'PERSON'), ('Uli Hoeness', 'PERSON'), ('Kimmich', 'PERSON'), ('Hoeness', 'ORG'), ('AP', 'ORG'), ('Ciarán Fahey', 'PERSON'), ('Ciarán Fahey', 'PERSON'), ('The Associated Press', 'ORG')]"

Miami private school nixes 30-day quarantine for vaccinated students,https://nypost.com/2021/10/25/miami-school-nixes-30-day-quarantine-for-vaccinated-students/,,['Joshua Rhett Miller'],,"A private school in Miami has reversed course on its controversial plan to force students who got COVID-19 vaccines to quarantine for 30 days, a report said Monday.","A private school in Miami has reversed course on its controversial plan to force students who got COVID-19 vaccines to quarantine for 30 days, a report said Monday.",2021-10-25 20:16:47,"A private school in Miami has reversed course on its controversial plan to force students who got COVID-19 vaccines to quarantine for 30 days, a report said Monday. The about-face by administrators at Centner Academy came after the state threatened to pull funding from the school if it went ahead with the plan, which was based on debunked claims that newly vaccinated people could shed the virus, WPLG reported . Centner’s chief operating officer, Bianca Erickson, assured the Florida Department of Education in a letter Friday that the school would not require any student to “quarantine at home” if vaccinated. “When we announced the subject policy regarding COVID-19, we believed that we were acting in compliance with the Department of Education’s Emergency Rule … which allows a student to be considered in attendance at school when under a ‘stay-home’ directive related to COVID-19,” Erickson wrote. “Our plan at the time included a ‘stay-home’ policy that would be supported by remote learning,” Erickson’s letter continued. “Please note, however, that the plan as announced was not implemented prior to receipt of your letter and we will not pursue any such measures.” State education officials had warned the school in a letter Thursday that the proposed policy would run afoul of the law and could lead to lost funding, WPLG reported. “Recently it has come to our attention that your schools may employ attendance policies which require parents of recently vaccinated students to quarantine their children for unreasonable, unnecessary and unduly burdensome amount of time before returning for in-person instruction,” the letter to the school read. The DOE warned that “swift and decisive” punitive actions against the school could follow, including the revocation of funding. A Post message seeking comment from the school was not returned Monday. The private K-8 school for roughly 300 students — where tuition costs up to $29,850 this year — had informed parents earlier this month that vaccinated students would need to stay home for at least 30 days after each dose and booster they received and could only return afterward if “healthy” and symptom-free. Dr. Aileen Maria Marty, an infectious-disease expert at Florida International University, blasted the message as “very destructive,” WPLG had reported . “That is not written by anyone who has any understanding of the science,” Marty told the station. “It’s just that simple, it’s pure fiction.” The school’s co-founder, David Centner, told WPLG in an email that the policy was designed to protect “students’ well-being and their sense of safety” while at school and based partly on “numerous” anecdotal cases. “Big Pharma itself has created reasonable uncertainty as to whether their product may carry the risk of ‘adverse events’ via inhalation or skin contact to those who are unvaccinated,” Centner added in the email. But Pfizer, maker of the only vaccine currently approved by the FDA for people age 12 and older, flatly told WPLG that its shot doesn’t contain virus particles and therefore they cannot be transmitted to others. “Because there is no virus produced in the body, no shedding occurs within the human body,” Pfizer said in a statement. “The vaccine cannot be inhaled via shedding and can only enter the human body through an administered dose.” A statement on the school’s website regarding its vaccine policy notes that it values “freedom of choice” and religion. “We are proud that our happiness school takes a comprehensive look at vaccine policies statewide, and we accept religious exemptions in lieu of proof of vaccination,” the website reads. Centner Academy also made national headlines in April when it asked its teachers to wait until the end of the school year to get vaccinated. If they did anyway, the educators were told they wouldn’t be able to return for the next academic year, CNN reported .",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Centner-Academy.jpg?quality=90&strip=all,nypost,True,"[('Miami', 'GPE'), ('COVID-19', 'ORG'), ('30 days', 'DATE'), ('Monday', 'DATE')]"

The sudden loss of amplified sound can be jarring, but when the crowd chimes in to close out song, like they did during this year’s Guns N’ Roses set, bellowing together “Oh, won’t you please take me ho-ome,” the inevitable viral video is marketing gold for the following year’s ticket sales. This year, the high-energy close may have served as a confidence booster for the hard rock band, which recently made its post-pandemic return to the road to play 25 shows postponed from its 2020 tour, as well as 14 new ones in nearby markets. The act’s last big series of concerts was the Not in this Lifetime tour, which made $500 million starting in spring 2016 and became the fourth-highest-grossing in history, according to Billboard Boxscore. Since the concert business started again, however, it is having a hard time getting fans to show up. On average, 10% of fans who bought tickets to see Guns N’ Roses in 2019 and 2020 are coming to its shows, and performances planned for later this year in Mexico and Europe have been pushed back to 2022, amid worries about weak walkup sales. {""nid"":""9648655"",""type"":""post"",""title"":""Live Nation Stock Is Trading Over $100.

This fall, the Eagles, Billy Joel, George Strait, Zac Brown and James Taylor have seen no-show rates as high as 25% for some concerts. Industry executives blame persistent fears about the spread of COVID-19 in indoor venues, even among those who are vaccinated, as well as competition with a flood of other concerts, festivals and destination events. Even for shows that sold out already, that means fewer bodies in seats, as well as waker food, beverage and merchandise sales – plus a blow to the ability to bookers and promoters to plan ahead. Festivals like BottleRock, which sold out “in a matter of minutes” this year company officials say, are a bright spot in the post-pandemic music business, with the majority of such events increasing their attendance over 2019 levels, according to Live Nation’s most recent earnings report. One reason: Outdoor festivals are perceived to be safer than indoor shows. They also provide much better value. “Fans can see so many more acts at a festival for the same price they would pay to attend a big headline tour,” says Bobby Dee, who’s producing the Once Upon a Time in LA festival in December, which features Snoop Dogg, The Game and Al Green and sold out in less than 24 hours. “They are coming out the pandemic and making the decision that they don’t want to spend two hours watching one artist play their set and encore. They want the freedom to roam the event and curate their own experience.” {""nid"":""9649281"",""type"":""post"",""title"":""Neumos in Seattle, in a Pandemic: Ticket Sales Have 'Dropped Off a Cliff'"",""relative_path"":""\/articles\/business\/9649281\/neumos-seattle-pandemic-ticket-sales-no-show-rates\/"",""media"":{""width"":1548,""height"":1024,""extension"":""jpg"",""mime_type"":""image\/jpeg"",""type"":""image"",""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2020\/04\/Steven-Severin-in-a-pandemic-2020-billboard-1548-1587584028-compressed.jpg"",""sizes"":[{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2020\/04\/Steven-Severin-in-a-pandemic-2020-billboard-1548-1587584028-compressed.jpg"",""width"":1548,""height"":1024},{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2020\/04\/Steven-Severin-in-a-pandemic-2020-billboard-1548-1587584028-compressed.jpg"",""width"":1548,""height"":1024}],""orientation"":""landscape"",""id"":""9363693"",""caption"":null,""credit"":null}} With this in mind, artists are rethinking their touring plans for next year and beyond. In most cases, traditional headline concerts pay artists a guaranteed minimum, after which ticket revenue is split with the promoter, which means both sides share risk. Festivals instead offer acts a flat payment, regardless of subsequent ticket sales. That’s appealing to booking agents, who are worried about exposing their clients to risks as the concert business re-opens. It also gives some festivals the chance to book once-in-a-lifetime headliners like Stevie Nicks, who was booked to perform at BottleRock. It can also mean paying huge fees to book headline talent that might not bring in the kind of ticket sales organizers hoped for. In the case of BottleRock, weeks before the event, Nicks announced she couldn’t perform because of “rising COVID cases,” which left organizers to find a replacement big enough to placate customers and hopefully prevent refund requests that would put the festival in financial jeopardy. They secured Chris Stapleton, but he too pulled out the night before he was supposed to take the stage, blaming an unspecified illness.

After all that, organizers say refund requests were minimal, speaking to the importance of the festival experience beyond headlining acts. But it shows how festivals may now need multiple backup plans. {""nid"":""9649430"",""type"":""post"",""title"":""How U.K. Touring Is Struggling to Keep On Truckin'"",""relative_path"":""\/articles\/business\/touring\/9649430\/uk-touring-struggling-post-brexit-rules\/"",""media"":{""width"":1548,""height"":1024,""extension"":""jpg"",""mime_type"":""image\/jpeg"",""type"":""image"",""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/10\/Market-global-bb15-2021-billboard-1548-1634755312-compressed.jpg"",""sizes"":[{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/10\/Market-global-bb15-2021-billboard-1548-1634755312-compressed.jpg"",""width"":1548,""height"":1024},{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/10\/Market-global-bb15-2021-billboard-1548-1634755312-compressed.jpg"",""width"":1548,""height"":1024}],""orientation"":""landscape"",""id"":""9648240"",""caption"":null,""credit"":null}} “If festivals continue to dominate in 2021, the major management companies might need to think about creating an on-call network of alternate acts that can step in at the last minute to high profile slots if something goes wrong,” said one agency source at the event. “We’ve got to prepare for a music business that’s going to require more flexibility and contingencies.”   {""account_id"":""1125911414"",""id"":""izFpZKac"",""title"":"""",""featured_media"":""""}",2021-10-25 20:12:30,,https://static.billboard.com/files/2021/10/guns-n-roses-bb15-touring-market-billboard-1548-1634754994-150x150.jpg,billboard,True,"[('BottleRock', 'ORG'), ('Napa', 'GPE'), ('Calif.', 'GPE'), ('10 pm', 'TIME'), ('this year', 'DATE'), ('the following year', 'DATE'), ('This year', 'DATE'), ('25', 'CARDINAL'), ('2020', 'DATE'), ('14', 'CARDINAL'), ('Lifetime', 'ORG'), ('$500 million', 'MONEY'), ('spring 2016', 'DATE'), ('fourth', 'ORDINAL'), ('Billboard Boxscore', 'PERSON'), ('10%', 'PERCENT'), ('Guns N’ Roses', 'ORG'), ('2019', 'DATE'), ('2020', 'DATE'), ('later this year', 'DATE'), ('Mexico', 'GPE'), ('Europe', 'LOC'), ('2022', 'DATE'), ('100', 'MONEY'), ('This fall', 'DATE'), ('Billy Joel', 'PERSON'), ('George Strait', 'PERSON'), ('Zac Brown', 'PERSON'), ('James Taylor', 'PERSON'), ('as high as 25%', 'PERCENT'), ('COVID-19', 'ORG'), ('BottleRock', 'ORG'), ('this year', 'DATE'), ('2019', 'DATE'), ('Live Nation’s', 'ORG'), ('One', 'CARDINAL'), ('Bobby Dee', 'PERSON'), ('the Once Upon a Time', 'LAW'), ('LA', 'GPE'), ('December', 'DATE'), ('Snoop Dogg', 'PERSON'), ('Al Green', 'PERSON'), ('less than 24 hours', 'TIME'), ('two hours', 'TIME'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('Seattle', 'GPE'), ('next year', 'DATE'), ('Stevie Nicks', 'PERSON'), ('BottleRock', 'ORG'), ('BottleRock', 'ORG'), ('weeks', 'DATE'), ('Nicks', 'PERSON'), ('COVID', 'PERSON'), ('Chris Stapleton', 'PERSON'), ('the night', 'TIME'), ('Brandi Carlile', 'ORG'), ('Highwomen', 'PERSON'), ('Yola', 'PERSON'), ('Keep', 'PERSON'), ('2021-billboard-1548-1634755312', 'DATE'), ('2021-billboard-1548-1634755312', 'DATE'), ('2021-billboard-1548-1634755312', 'DATE'), ('2021', 'DATE'), ('the last minute', 'TIME'), ('one', 'CARDINAL')]"
Delay in BPCL sale likely as suitors find no partners,https://www.thehansindia.com/business/delay-in-bpcl-sale-likely-as-suitors-find-no-partners-712467,"['Business,Today NewsPaper']",['The Hans India'],,"The 3 suitors-Vedanta Group, Apollo Global Management and I Squared Capital-talking to global energy giants and sovereign and pension funds, but haven’t been able to finalize partners","Delay in BPCL sale likely as suitors find no partnersDelay in BPCL sale likely as suitors find no partnersIndia's plan to privatize Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) has run into rough weather with bidders struggling to find partners and spread their financial risks, according to people familiar with the matter.The three suitors - the Vedanta group, Apollo Global Management and I Squared Capital - are talking to global energy giants and sovereign and pension funds, but haven't been able to finalize partners, the people said, asking not to be identified as the deliberations are private. Some bidders are finding it difficult to invest due to sustainability rules that make it tougher for them to buy a stake in an oil refiner, some of the people said. The fresh hurdle to sell the government's entire stake could temper some of the euphoria generated by the recent sale of Air India Ltd to the Tata Group and slow down the nation's biggest privatization drive. The sale of the state-run refiner-cum-fuel retailer would have fetched about $13 billion for the exchequer and other shareholders. BPCL shares fell 3.5 per cent to Rs 431.7 at the close in Mumbai, the most in more than a month, following the Bloomberg News report. The massive price tag means bidders as well as the Indian government want a consortium with stronger technical and financial muscle for the transaction, the people said. Spokesmen at the finance ministry and BPCL weren't immediately available for a comment, while Apollo Global declined to comment. Representatives at Vedanta and I Squared didn't reply to emails seeking comment. India Still Hopes Oil Majors Will Join Race for Biggest Sale.A global push toward green energy and pressure from investors to slash emissions is holding back companies from making large investments in fossil fuels. The pandemic and its fallout has also delayed the process and discouraged global firms from committing big investments in traditional fuels. For BPCL, the bidders have been slow in conducting due diligence as they wait for new partners to join, the people said. That will likely upend the federal government's aim to complete selling its entire 53 per cent holding in BPCL by the end of this financial year in March, for which it had planned to seek financial bids next month. BPCL allowed bidders virtual access to its financial data early April, but it hasn't progressed beyond exchange of a few queries and some initial discussions with the state-run company's management in the past six months. ""Bidders are conducting due diligence, but uncertainty over the bidder consortium and process complexity, including valuation, may lead to potential delays,"" Fitch Ratings Ltd. said in a commentary last month. ""We believe the risks of further Covid-19 waves and global oil and gas companies' increased focus on energy transition lead to additional uncertainty over the timing and valuation of potentially large acquisitions in the sector."" BPCL has three refineries that can process about 700,000 barrels of oil daily, a marketing network of almost 19,000 fuel stations and close to 6,200 liquefied petroleum gas distributors.

Below, we'll take a closer look at what's driving these two stocks higher on Monday. Image source: Tesla. Tesla looks to $1 trillion Shares of Tesla were up more than 9% Monday afternoon . That brought the stock price to just shy of $1,000 per share, and it sent the electric vehicle pioneer's market capitalization close to the $1 trillion mark. Several factors helped to send Tesla's stock higher. Wall Street analysts have been increasingly optimistic about Tesla's prospects, and analysts at Morgan Stanley boosted their price target on the automaker's stock to $1,200 per share, up by $300 from its previous target. In addition, rental car company Hertz (OTC: HTZZ) made an initial EV order for 100,000 Tesla vehicles, with the expectation of taking delivery by the end of 2022. Tesla's recent earnings report highlighted the huge efforts that the automaker has made to bolster its production capacity. With the company all but certain to reach its 750,000 vehicle-delivery target for 2021, the next step is ensuring that 2022 can take Tesla's deliveries well past the 1 million mark. Tesla stock has been a favorite among individual investors, and the company's fundamental business performance has been impressive as well. Despite constant concerns from some investors about valuation, Tesla's shares have the potential to keep climbing even from current levels. Heading into the cloud Meanwhile, shares of Cloudflare were up more than 5% on Monday afternoon. That left Cloudflare's market capitalization at a much more modest level of $61 billion when compared to Tesla, but the stock has never been higher, and the company has a lot of tailwinds that should support further growth. Edge network services have become increasingly important as more companies rely more heavily on cloud computing and build out their online business presence. Cloudflare has been able to capitalize on this huge demand while avoiding some of the pitfalls that have presented challenges to its peers in the industry. It has attracted some of the biggest companies in the world as clients, and it has been able to retain its customers while encouraging them to increase their spending on cloud-computing services over time. Cloudflare is poised to report earnings in early November, and shareholders are optimistic that the company will be able to sustain its positive momentum. As the global economy recovers, current and potential clients will be in an even better position to scale up their investments in IT development. Expectations are already high for Cloudflare, so earnings results will probably have to be demonstrably superior in order to satisfy investors. When markets hit record highs, there are always strong stocks that are setting the pace. Moves for Tesla and Cloudflare are great examples of exciting investments that are helping to bolster Wall Street as we approach the end of the year.",,fool,True,"[('September', 'DATE'), ('COVID-19', 'ORG'), ('U.S.', 'GPE'), ('1:30 p.m. EDT', 'TIME'), ('89', 'CARDINAL'), ('35,766', 'CARDINAL'), ('24', 'CARDINAL'), ('4,569', 'CARDINAL'), ('136', 'CARDINAL'), ('Monday', 'DATE'), ('Tesla', 'ORG'), ('NASDAQ', 'ORG'), ('Cloudflare', 'ORG'), ('NYSE', 'ORG'), ('NET', 'ORG'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('the months', 'DATE'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('Monday', 'DATE')]"

Opinion: Comparing COVID-19 restrictions to Nazi tactics is disgraceful and offensive,https://www.deseret.com/opinion/2021/10/25/22745180/utah-governor-nazi-swastika-covid19-protest-jewish-holocaust-offensive,,['Spencer Cox'],,,"Protesters gather outside of the Governor’s Mansion in Salt Lake City last fall in opposition to a state mask mandate and other COVID-19 restrictions. | Kristin Murphy, Deseret News Protecting public health should never be equated to the horrors committed by the Nazi regime during the Holocaust Like the rest of the nation, Utah is working hard to keep the Beehive State safe from COVID-19. Yet, in the face of this enormous challenge, some have abandoned reason in favor of hate-fueled actions. Protests began early and spread nearly in sync with the pandemic. The right to protest is a fundamental American right. Unfortunately, some used the coronavirus as a convenient catalyst to focus bigotry on Asians and others. Rules regarding the use of face coverings and promotion of vaccines may have created an inconvenient imposition, yet were met with vitriol directed at ethnic and religious groups and also the leaders of the public health response. One of the most disgraceful and misplaced of the myriad comparisons used to decry the public health measures are Holocaust analogies and Nazi symbols. Earlier this month, a group of protesters outside the Governor’s Mansion displayed enormous banners with swastikas formed out of the image of syringes — equating vaccination with Nazism. Comparing the two makes a mockery of the scale and scope of the Holocaust and the systematic murder by the Nazis of 6 million Jews, including 1.5 million children and millions of other innocents. Extremists have invoked new conspiracies by using old tropes to blame Jews for the pandemic or profiting from it. We have also watched with alarm as protesters have affixed a yellow Star of David to their clothing to protest public health requirements. Jews in Nazi-Germany were forced to wear yellow stars visibly on their clothing so they could be identified as Jews in the aftermath of the violent pogrom Kristallnacht on Nov. 9, 1938.

Yet, in the face of this enormous challenge, some have abandoned reason in favor of hate-fueled actions. Protests began early and spread nearly in sync with the pandemic. The right to protest is a fundamental American right. Unfortunately, some used the coronavirus as a convenient catalyst to focus bigotry on Asians and others. Rules regarding the use of face coverings and promotion of vaccines may have created an inconvenient imposition, yet were met with vitriol directed at ethnic and religious groups and also the leaders of the public health response. One of the most disgraceful and misplaced of the myriad comparisons used to decry the public health measures are Holocaust analogies and Nazi symbols. Earlier this month, a group of protesters outside the Governor’s Mansion displayed enormous banners with swastikas formed out of the image of syringes — equating vaccination with Nazism. Comparing the two makes a mockery of the scale and scope of the Holocaust and the systematic murder by the Nazis of 6 million Jews, including 1.5 million children and millions of other innocents. Extremists have invoked new conspiracies by using old tropes to blame Jews for the pandemic or profiting from it. We have also watched with alarm as protesters have affixed a yellow Star of David to their clothing to protest public health requirements. Jews in Nazi-Germany were forced to wear yellow stars visibly on their clothing so they could be identified as Jews in the aftermath of the violent pogrom Kristallnacht on Nov. 9, 1938.

More posts by this contributor From startups to Starbucks: The embedded API opportunity How retailers can survive the Amazon era The quest to provide more affordable and accessible healthcare, magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic, has spurred an explosion of innovation, which in turn has attracted massive amounts of capital. To put this into perspective, consider this: In 2019, digital health saw $7.7 billion in VC investment, and that number rose to $14.6 billion in 2020. However, the first half of 2021 alone saw $14.7 billion in VC investment. Its marriage with fintech is the catalyst for the transformation of the healthcare industry. Similar to the unbundling of financial services and how fintech is scaling vertical SaaS, the pandemic-fueled disaggregation of healthcare has created new players that are taking a page out of the fintech revolution book — all starting with payments. A growing number of startups are now leveraging the fintech playbook to solve a key part of the healthcare problem — the shifting dynamics between patients, payers and providers, and how payments and related electronic health records (EHRs) flow between them. Not only is the onus of payments and data flow moving from payers to patients, but providers are now facing a monumental shift to new billing and engagement models, requiring new technologies and platforms to help with the change. Through the lens of fintech, here are three key areas to watch in healthcare. Gamifying consumer wellness to stave off chronic illnesses One of the largest trends impacting the population today is the steady rise of chronic illnesses. It is estimated that nearly half the U.S. population will have a chronic illness by 2025. People are getting sicker for longer periods of time, which leads to a constant spending streak. Patients not adhering to medical guidance is a major factor and is responsible for $100 billion of healthcare spending and over 100,000 deaths annually. With around a fifth of patients never filling their prescriptions, it has become a priority to educate and incentivize patients to complete care and avoid readmissions or ER visits. The convergence of health and fintech will be an important catalyst to address some of the most pressing issues facing healthcare today. To curb the rise of chronic illnesses and the associated recurring costs, many startups are using behavioral economics and gamification to incentivize patients and build healthy habits. For example, companies like Paceline in the U.S., Sweatcoin in Europe and Betterfly in Latin America gamify wellness by combining fitness and financial rewards. On the other hand, startups like Sempre Health and Wellth are tackling medical non-adherence with behavioral economics. For example, Wellth financially rewards actions like on-time prescription intake or regular A1c tests for diabetic patients. Fintech for affordability and reducing friction Looking at payers, there’s a major shift stemming from the rise of high-deductible healthcare plans (HDHP) — enrollment has risen 43% in the last five years — emphasizing an increase in premiums and patient financial responsibility.

How to make fragile global supply chains stronger and more sustainable,https://theconversation.com/how-to-make-fragile-global-supply-chains-stronger-and-more-sustainable-169310,,"['Adel Guitouni', ' Associate Professor', ' International Business', ' University of Victoria']",,,"Shipping containers are moved from the Fairview Cove Container Terminal In Halifax in May 2021. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Andrew Vaughan In 2019, global supply chains moved more than US$19 trillion in exported goods. The production and sale of many items we need and use — including toys, clothes, food, electronics and home furniture — depend on global supply chains. For most of us, supply chains are no longer an abstract concept. The COVID-19 pandemic raised our awareness about the interdependence of our economic systems. We now understand the many ways these chains directly shape and impact our lives. The pandemic has also revealed the fragility of global supply chains as U.S. President Joe Biden and others warn of the impact on the world economy of continuing supply-chain bottlenecks. Cargo container ships are seen anchored outside the Port of Los Angeles in San Pedro, Calif., in the fall of 2021. (AP Photo/Ringo H.W. Chiu) A supply chain is a set of organizations — like suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and retailers — that work together to provide end customers with a specific product or service. The supply chain becomes global when the product or service crosses multiple international boundaries. Global supply chain organizations are directly and indirectly dependent on each other. Supply chain problems cascade Global supply chains have conventionally been focused on achieving financial efficiency above all else. The result is messy and fragile global supply chain systems. In practice, the decisions made and actions taken by each organization affect the performance of the entire supply chain. A problem at any point feeds other problems at different stages of the chain. A product shortage at a retail store, for example, might be caused by unsuspected problems such as labour issues, raw material shortages or clogged ports. Semiconductor shortages are disrupting the automobile industry. Meanwhile, the cost of moving a container from China to the west coast of North America is estimated to have increased by 650 per cent since before the pandemic. Shelves are nearly empty in the paper towel section of a Target store in the U.S. in August 2021 due to COVID-19 supply chain issues. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski) Race to the bottom The pursuit of financial efficiency has shifted global production to low-cost regions, increased the flows of freights, caused port congestion and eroded the resilience of supply chains. Cutting costs above all else became a race to the bottom. It resulted in global economies with limited redundancies, contingencies and safeguards. Fragile global supply chains are exacerbated by the fragmentation of decision-making processes, limited collaboration between buyers and suppliers and transactional management. There is no obvious centralized business or authority commanding and controlling these chains. Instead, several companies co-operate and compete for the value created. Global supply chains also account for large contributions to greenhouse gas emissions and have an impact on air, land and water biodiversity and geological resources. A typical company’s supply chain is responsible for 80 per cent of its greenhouse emissions and more than 90 per cent of its contribution to air pollution generated in the production and distribution of a consumer product. One billion metric tonnes of emissions could be saved if key suppliers to 125 of the world’s biggest purchasers increased their renewable energy input by 20 per cent. The impact of supply chains extends to society. For example, the problem of forced labour is well-documented in today’s global supply chains, resulting in several controversies about modern slavery. More than 24.9 million people are documented to be working in slavery conditions in these chains. Businesses in global supply chains are facing increased pressure from different stakeholders to adopt sustainability and disclose their impacts. A Dutch court recently ordered Shell to reduce its carbon emissions by 45 per cent from its 2019 levels. In the future, supply chain disclosure and transparency will become the norm of good governance. Former fishing slaves who were rescued by the Indonesian government from the remote island of Benjina are seen following a 2015 investigation into slavery in the seafood industry. (AP Photo/Margie Mason) Robust supply chains in demand The world needs robust supply chains that are founded on sustainability, collaboration, trust, transparency, visibility and diversification of supply. That new model of supply chains could help combat economic fragility, climate change and inequality. Global supply chains connect businesses and markets across all layers of economic, social and ecological systems. That means customers, governments and other stakeholders should encourage the emergence of robust and sustainable supply chains. Responsible decision-making within supply chains has the potential to contribute to economic progress and societal well-being while maintaining the environmental integrity of the planet. Our preliminary research on sustainable blueberry supply chains, to be published soon, indicates that sustainability contributes to resilience. Supply chain management is a “team sport.” Current research provides ample evidence that collaboration benefits global supply chains. Buyers and suppliers can enjoy higher service levels, more product availability and significant reductions in costs if they work together. More preliminary research we’ve conducted on personal protective equipment supply chains in British Columbia, also to be published in the weeks to come, shows that collaboration between the supplier and customer reduces costs and risks by at least 17 per cent. Effective collaboration contributes to supply chain resilience and helps avoid future disruptions. A driver for Safecare B.C. secures a load of personal protective equipment in a truck in Surrey, B.C. in April 2020. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jonathan Hayward Building effective collaboration means rewarding responsible and long-term management of global supply chains and discouraging short-lived gains. Global supply chains should promote sharing the gains and the pains among buyers and suppliers. Incentives need to be created to encourage this collaboration. Digitization of the economy will also contribute to better transparency and traceability in global supply chains. Nonetheless, moving towards robust global supply chains isn’t straightforward because historically, they’ve been focused on short-term rewards. For decades, we’ve justified the development of fragile and fragmented global supply chains in the name of economic growth and financial efficiency. This may have provided short-term benefits, but it has created our current supply chain crisis. Will that crisis reveal a way forward?

Though he was connected with fans through social media, important activism campaigns and two live streaming presentations, he admits that it “didn’t compare to the rhythm of work I was used to.” After seeing that the touring industry was reopening and the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines, Fernandez felt confident enough to kick off his 2021 Hecho en Mexico U.S. tour on Sept. 10 at the Grand Sierra Theatre in Reno, Nevada. The 21-date tour, presented by Live Nation, wrapped up on Oct. 24 at the Arizona Federal Theatre in Phoenix. “It was one of the most important tours I have ever had in my career here in the United States,” Fernandez tells Billboard of the gratifying experience. {""nid"":""9531445"",""type"":""post"",""title"":""All the Latin Tours Announced for 2021 (Updating)"",""relative_path"":""\/articles\/columns\/latin\/9531445\/latin-tours-2021-maluma-banda-ms-more\/"",""media"":{""width"":1548,""height"":1024,""extension"":""jpg"",""mime_type"":""image\/jpeg"",""type"":""image"",""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/09\/Jay-Wheeler-chartbreaker-bb13-2021-billboard-1548-1632174256-compressed.jpg"",""sizes"":[{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/09\/Jay-Wheeler-chartbreaker-bb13-2021-billboard-1548-1632174256-compressed.jpg"",""width"":1548,""height"":1024},{""path"":""https:\/\/static.billboard.com\/files\/2021\/09\/Jay-Wheeler-chartbreaker-bb13-2021-billboard-1548-1632174256-compressed.jpg"",""width"":1548,""height"":1024}],""orientation"":""landscape"",""id"":""9633011"",""caption"":null,""credit"":null}} Hecho en Mexico also served as a fundraiser for Families Belong Together, where Fernandez donated over $100,000 from the tour proceeds to assist immigrant families separated at the U.S.-Mexico border. “The impact of my concerts goes beyond the money, the box office, and the sold-out shows,” he explains. “I have always been a very sensitive person to things that happen, especially if it happens in my country.

Eight things we learned from the Facebook Papers,https://www.theverge.com/22740969/facebook-files-papers-frances-haugen-whistleblower-civic-integrity,,['Russell Brandom'],,,"A massive new document release shows chaos and confusion inside the world’s most powerful social network For months, Facebook has been shaken by a steady leak of documents from whistleblower Frances Haugen, beginning in The Wall Street Journal but spreading to government officials and nearly any outlet with an interest in the company. Now, those documents are going much more public, giving us the most sweeping look at the operations of Facebook anyone not directly involved with the company has ever had. The documents stem from disclosures made to the SEC and provided to Congress by Haugen in redacted form. The Verge and a consortium of other news organizations have obtained redacted versions of the documents, which we’re calling The Facebook Papers. In order to receive the documents, we agreed to begin publishing our reporting on them this week, but we are not beholden to report on them in a certain way or coordinate what we cover with other outlets. We’ve already done some reporting on the files, and we’ll keep reporting on them over the coming weeks. (There are a lot of pages.) This isn’t a comprehensive list of everything in the documents, and you should fully expect more to come out. Instead, think of it as a summary of the files that, so far, have stood out to us the most. Hopefully, it will help you make sense of the sheer volume of Facebook news coming out this morning. Facebook was caught off guard by vaccine misinformation in comments Facebook has taken a lot of criticism for its handling of COVID misinformation — including from President Biden, who accused the platform of “killing people” by letting anti-vaxx sentiment run amok — but the leaks show just how chaotic the effort was inside the company. One document dated March 2021 shows an employee raising the alarm about how unprepared the platform was. “Vaccine hesitancy in comments is rampant,” the memo reads. “Our ability to detect vaccine-hesitant comments is bad in English, and basically non-existent elsewhere. We need Policy guidelines specifically aimed at vaccine hesitancy in comments.” (Editor’s note: We are not publishing the document itself since it contains the full name of a Facebook employee.) “Comments are a significant portion of misinfo on FB,” says another employee in an internal comment, “and are almost a complete blind spot for us in terms of enforcement and transparency right now.” “For English posts on Vaccines, vaccine hesitancy prevalence among comments is 50 percent.” The document makes clear that Facebook already had a “COVID-19 lockdown defense” project dedicated to the platform dynamics created by the pandemic, including a workstream dedicated entirely to vaccine hesitancy. That team had also created significant automated flagging systems for misinformation — but according to the files, those simply weren’t being used to downrank anti-vaccine comments. As of the March memo, there were no plans to develop moderation infrastructure like labeling, guidelines, and classifier systems to identify anti-vaccine statements in comments. The failure to meaningfully moderate comments was noticed outside the company. A First Draft News study in May looked at the comments for a handful of major news outlets with more than a million followers and found one in five comments on vaccine-related stories contained some kind of anti-vaccine misinformation. The documents show Facebook was aware of the problem, and First Draft may have even underestimated the issue. One comment on the post reads, “for English posts on Vaccines, vaccine hesitancy prevalence among comments is 50 percent.” Other aspects of the issue remained completely unstudied since the company had yet to dig in on the comment problem. “We currently don’t understand whether Group comments are a serious problem,” the post argues. “It’s clear to us that the ‘good post, bad comment’ problem is a big deal, but it’s not necessarily as clear that [vaccine hesitant] comments on [vaccine hesitant] posts are additive to the harm.” Another document published shortly after April 2021 shows the company still coming to terms with vaccine misinformation. The good news was that there was no evidence of a foreign influence campaign driving anti-vaxx sentiment, as had stung the company in 2016. But the vast majority of content was being sent by a relatively small portion of accounts, suggesting that Facebook had not yet taken the easiest measures to address the issue. Facebook has taken some steps recently to address misinformation in comments — including new downranking rules from just last week. But these documents show those changes came more than six months after the alarm had been raised internally and after Facebook had publicly expressed anxiety about the impending leak. Given the huge surge of COVID deaths among vaccine-skeptical populations over the past three months, it’s easy to see the recent changes as too little, too late. Apple threatened to ban Facebook over online “slave markets” Facebook scrambled to address human trafficking content after Apple threatened to kick its apps off the iOS App Store, a leaked SEV (or Site Event) report shows. The report, referenced briefly by The Wall Street Journal’s Facebook Files reporting, indicates that Apple threatened to pull Facebook and Instagram from iOS on October 23rd of 2019. Apple had been tipped off by a BBC News Arabic report that found domestic workers being sold via Instagram and other apps, where sellers encouraged buyers to mistreat the workers by doing things such as confiscating their passports. the policy was “highly likely leading to exploitation of domestic servants” Facebook had been aware of the problem but hadn’t understood the scope of it, apparently because very little content (less than 2 percent of the material it found) had been reported by users. “Removing our applications from Apple platforms would have had potentially severe consequences to the business,” the Facebook report notes. After Apple escalated the issue, Facebook moderators swept the platforms for keywords and hashtags mentioned in the BBC reporting, ultimately disabling 1,021 accounts and removing 129,121 pieces of content. Facebook also removed a policy exception letting established brick and mortar businesses like recruitment agencies post ads about domestic workers. Facebook determined that even if the businesses were legal, the policy was “highly likely leading to exploitation of domestic servants.” Apple was apparently satisfied with the mitigation measures, and the incident was closed within a week. The Civic Integrity team was often directly blocked by Zuckerberg One of the most alarming incidents uncovered by the papers was that Mark Zuckerberg personally intervened to ensure Facebook would comply with a repressive law instituted in Vietnam, agreeing to moderate more aggressively against “anti-state” content on the platform. The anecdote leads The Washington Post’s report on the papers and plays into a much more troubling dynamic described by Haugen before Congress. Facebook’s Integrity team had lots of ideas for how to make Facebook less harmful, but they were usually overruled, sometimes by Zuckerberg himself. Bloomberg News explores the issue in more detail, showing how the company often found its own efforts to downrank harmful content overwhelmed by the content’s inherent virality. As one employee put it, “I worry that Feed is becoming an arms race.” Politico highlights another employee quote showing just how demoralized the team had become. “If we really want to change the state of our information ecosystem, we need a revolution, not an evolution of our systems,” an employee wrote in October 2019. “If you don’t have enough good content to boost, it doesn’t matter how much you downrank the bad.” Facebook used a German anti-vaccine movement as a test case for more aggressive moderation Another document details Facebook’s so-called “Querdenken experiment,” in which the company’s moderators tested out a more aggressive moderation approach on a German conspiracy movement. Facebook’s Dangerous Content team was already developing a new classification — a “harmful topic community” — and the growing Querdenken was chosen as an experiment on how the classification would work in practice. As a Facebook employee writes in the document, “this could be a good case study to inform how we tackle these problems in the future” “this could be a good case study to inform how we tackle these problems in the future” Querdenken has become one of the leading anti-lockdown and anti-vaccination groups in Germany, with similarities to more extreme groups like QAnon. As the Facebook proposal framed it, the Querdenken movement had potential for violence but wasn’t yet linked to extreme enough activity that would justify banning followers from the platform entirely. The documents give few details about how the experiment proceeded, although clearly, some version of the Querdenken plan was implemented. (A later report says “results from some initial samples look promising.”) And judging by the company’s public statements, it did result in a meaningful change to moderation policy: in September, Facebook announced a new policy on “coordinated social harm,” specifically citing Querdenken as an example of the new approach in action. Unlike many of the other documents, the Querdenken experiment shows Facebook’s moderation system as relatively effective. The company identified the group before it caused significant harm, took action with an eye towards long-term consequences and was transparent about the policy shift after it took place. But the incident shows how complex the interplay of policy and enforcement can be, with broader policies often rewritten with an eye towards specific groups. And for supporters of Querdenken, it may be alarming to learn that the rules of the world’s largest social platform were rewritten specifically to keep their movement from gaining public support. Facebook’s January 6th response was shaped by glitches and delays Facebook discussed developing extreme “break-glass measures” to limit misinformation, calls to violence, and other material that could disrupt the 2020 presidential election. But when former President Donald Trump and his supporters tried to stop successor Joe Biden from being declared president on January 6th, 2021, Facebook employees complained these measures were implemented too late or stymied by technical and bureaucratic hangups. Reports at Politico and The New York Times outline Facebook’s struggle to handle users delegitimizing the elections. Internally, critics said Facebook didn’t have a sufficient game plan for “harmful non-violating narratives” that toed the line between misinformation and content Facebook wants to preserve as free speech. And some plans, like a change that would have prevented Groups from changing their names to terms like “Stop the Steal,” apparently got held up by technical problems. Facebook was trying to rebalance its News Feed for “civic health” The Wall Street Journal first revealed that news outlets and political parties had complained about users favoring negative and hyperbolic content. Facebook was considering ways to fix the problem, and one method involved re-weighting the News Feed to optimize for “civic health” instead of primarily focusing on meaningful social interactions or session time. In a product briefing called “Ranking For Civic Health,” Facebook acknowledged that “people think that political content on Facebook is low quality, untrustworthy, and divisive,” and the current ranking system was “not creating a wholly valuable civic experience for users.” (Based on document comment dates, the document was produced around January and February of 2020.) “people think that political content on Facebook is low quality, untrustworthy, and divisive” The document says Facebook’s ranking algorithm recommended civic content that users themselves didn’t report finding valuable — something earlier leaks have indicated was a problem with meaningful social interactions (MSI) and other engagement-based metrics. “Our current ranking objectives do not optimize for integrity outcomes, which can have dangerous consequences,” it says — for instance, MSI optimization was “contributing hugely to Civic misinfo,” and Facebook estimated that removing it from Civic posts would decrease it by 30 to 50 percent. Facebook tried to improve civic health by asking users explicitly what they thought constituted good civic content. This sometimes revealed even bigger problems — since Facebook apparently found that 20 to 30 percent of respondents “may say that known Civic hate is ‘good for the community’” in surveys. Facebook settled on a strategy to “prioritize the reduction of policy-violating content — such as Civic Hate or Civic Misinfo — even if the individual user finds it valuable” and aimed to reduce the prevalence of civic hate speech, misinformation, and inflammatory content by at least 10 percent. The company ran rebalancing experiments in February 2020 by slightly increasing the amount of “civic” News Feed content that a random set of users saw, then optimizing that content through different metrics (including MSI and whether people thought content was “worth your time”). It also ran a survey to collect how users felt about civic News Feed content. The company aimed to have a new optimization system chosen by March of 2020 — although it’s not clear how the coronavirus pandemic may have changed those plans. Why likes were never hidden on Facebook and Instagram A highly publicized plan from early last year to hide like counts on Instagram never happened because testing the change hurt ad revenue and led to people using the app less. A quiet test of the experience on the Facebook app was also killed after leadership told Zuckerberg that it wasn’t a “top barrier to sharing nor a top concern for people.” A lengthy internal presentation to Zuckerberg about the plan, dubbed Project Daisy, shows that there were concerns among leadership about how the Facebook app would have been perceived if Instagram hid like counts and Facebook did not, which is something employees who were involved in the project have told The Verge. Employees working on Instagram wanted to bill it as a way to depressurize the app for young people, but the team working on the Facebook app wasn’t into the idea. If Instagram went through with hiding likes, the presentation details how leadership at Facebook wanted to “minimize blowback to the Facebook app” for not hiding them and still “ensure credit ladders up to the Facebook company.” Instead of hiding likes for all users by default as was originally planned, Instagram earlier adopted a half measure by letting people opt into hiding their likes. Facebook’s “civic groups” policy stumbled over a simple design flaw In October 2020, Facebook announced that it would stop recommending civic and political groups to users in the US as part of a broader effort to avoid the mistakes of the 2016 election. (The policy was made permanent shortly after the January 6th riot.) But actually keeping those groups out of Facebook recommendation feeds has been a huge challenge for the company — and an internal document gives us new insight into why. The document shows Facebook employees grappling with a public article, flagged by the PR team, which found 30 separate groups still appearing in recommendation feeds in apparent violation of the policy. Escalated on January 19th, the document says many of the groups named in the report had been labeled as civic groups at one point — but were somehow still being recommended as part of facebook’s Groups You Should Join feature. Reducing churn could have solved almost all of the problems “Leakage has been there since Nov 2020 at the least,” the Facebook document reads. It’s not clear which article the document is referring to, but there were a number of reports spotting enforcement failures at the time. The Markup found a bunch of groups slipping through that January and again in June. Even now, it’s not clear the civic groups policy is being enforced as intended. At the time, most observers focused on the conceptual difficulty: it’s a hard philosophical problem to draw a clear line between which groups count as “civic” and even harder to scale it across a platform of Facebook’s size. But the internal report shows the real problem was much simpler. Facebook’s monitoring system (referred to in the report as “Laser”) had been trained to only look at the past seven days of content when determining whether a page fell into the “civic groups” category, which meant pages were constantly filtering in and out as the period viewed by the algorithm changed. In practice, that meant a pro-Trump or pro-Biden group could easily dodge the label by posting a few days worth of less obviously political content. The report estimates that a full 12 percent of labeled groups would churn out of the category from day to day. According to the report, 90 percent of the groups highlighted by the article had been caught by Facebook’s existing “civic groups” classifier — but they’d filtered out as part of the churn. So reducing churn alone could have solved almost all of the problems spotted by the report. There have been lots of stories like this over the past five years: Facebook sets a policy that seems measured and responsible, but a cursory test (usually from a journalist) shows banned content is still easily slipping through. From the outside, it’s often unclear how much of the problem is incompetence at Facebook and how much is just the inherent difficulty of managing a platform of that size. But in this case, the documents put the blame squarely on Facebook as a company. This was a high-profile policy with huge stakes for the country at large, with obvious delicacy in how it was implemented. A churn rate that high made it inevitable that targeted groups would slip through the cracks, and the company simply didn’t notice until reporters called them out.",2021-10-25 15:40:19,,,theverge,True,"[('months', 'DATE'), ('Frances Haugen', 'PERSON'), ('The Wall Street Journal', 'ORG'), ('SEC', 'ORG'), ('Congress', 'ORG'), ('Haugen', 'GPE'), ('The Facebook Papers', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('this week', 'DATE'), ('the coming weeks', 'DATE'), ('this morning', 'TIME'), ('COVID', 'PERSON'), ('Biden', 'PERSON'), ('One', 'CARDINAL'), ('March 2021', 'DATE'), ('Vaccine', 'PERSON'), ('English', 'LANGUAGE'), ('English', 'NORP'), ('Vaccines', 'ORG'), ('50 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('March', 'DATE'), ('First', 'ORDINAL'), ('Draft News', 'ORG'), ('May', 'DATE'), ('more than a million', 'CARDINAL'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('five', 'CARDINAL'), ('First Draft', 'ORG'), ('One', 'CARDINAL'), ('English', 'NORP'), ('Vaccines', 'ORG'), ('50 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('Group', 'ORG'), ('April 2021', 'DATE'), ('2016', 'DATE'), ('just last week', 'DATE'), ('more than six months', 'DATE'), ('COVID', 'PERSON'), ('the past three months', 'DATE'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('App Store', 'PERSON'), ('SEV', 'ORG'), ('Site Event', 'ORG'), ('The Wall Street Journal’s', 'ORG'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('Facebook and Instagram', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('October 23rd of 2019', 'DATE'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('BBC News', 'ORG'), ('Arabic', 'LANGUAGE'), ('Instagram', 'ORG'), ('less than 2 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('BBC', 'ORG'), ('1,021', 'CARDINAL'), ('129,121', 'CARDINAL'), ('Apple', 'ORG'), ('a week', 'DATE'), ('Civic Integrity', 'ORG'), ('Zuckerberg', 'PERSON'), ('Mark Zuckerberg', 'PERSON'), ('Vietnam', 'GPE'), ('The Washington Post’s', 'ORG'), ('Haugen', 'ORG'), ('Congress', 'ORG'), ('Facebook’s Integrity', 'ORG'), ('Zuckerberg', 'PERSON'), ('Bloomberg News', 'ORG'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('Feed', 'PERSON'), ('Politico', 'PERSON'), ('October 2019', 'DATE'), ('German', 'NORP'), ('Facebook’s', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('German', 'NORP'), ('Querdenken', 'PERSON'), ('Querdenken', 'PERSON'), ('Germany', 'GPE'), ('QAnon', 'ORG'), ('Querdenken', 'PERSON'), ('Querdenken', 'PERSON'), ('September', 'DATE'), ('Querdenken', 'PERSON'), ('Querdenken', 'PERSON'), ('Facebook’s', 'ORG'), ('Querdenken', 'ORG'), ('January 6th', 'DATE'), ('2020', 'DATE'), ('Donald Trump', 'PERSON'), ('Joe Biden', 'PERSON'), ('January 6th, 2021', 'DATE'), ('The New York Times', 'ORG'), ('Facebook’s', 'ORG'), ('Groups', 'ORG'), ('Stop the Steal', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('News Feed', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('The Wall Street Journal', 'ORG'), ('first', 'ORDINAL'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('the News Feed', 'ORG'), ('Ranking For Civic Health', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('MSI', 'ORG'), ('MSI', 'ORG'), ('Civic', 'PRODUCT'), ('Civic', 'ORG'), ('30 to 50 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('20 to 30 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('Civic', 'ORG'), ('Civic Hate', 'ORG'), ('Civic Misinfo', 'PERSON'), ('at least 10 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('February 2020', 'DATE'), ('MSI', 'ORG'), ('March', 'DATE'), ('2020', 'DATE'), ('Facebook and Instagram', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('early last year', 'DATE'), ('Instagram', 'ORG'), ('Zuckerberg', 'PERSON'), ('Zuckerberg', 'PERSON'), ('Project Daisy', 'PERSON'), ('Instagram', 'ORG'), ('Instagram', 'ORG'), ('Instagram', 'PERSON'), ('Instagram', 'ORG'), ('half', 'CARDINAL'), ('October 2020', 'DATE'), ('US', 'GPE'), ('2016', 'DATE'), ('January 6th', 'DATE'), ('30', 'CARDINAL'), ('January 19th', 'DATE'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('facebook’s Groups You Should Join', 'ORG'), ('Nov 2020', 'DATE'), ('Markup', 'PERSON'), ('January', 'DATE'), ('June', 'DATE'), ('Facebook’s', 'ORG'), ('the past seven days', 'DATE'), ('pro-Biden', 'PERSON'), ('a few days', 'DATE'), ('a full 12 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('90 percent', 'PERCENT'), ('Facebook’s', 'ORG'), ('the past five years', 'DATE')]"

He said: “First off, it’s just a tribute to the the tenacity of human spirit as we push humans and machines farther than we ever have, going both to stay in extended stays for low earth orbit, opening it up to private companies and private astronauts, and knowing that we’ll continue our exploration to go even farther.” The destination is the International Space Station (ISS) roughly 250 miles above the Earth’s surface. Once there, the spacefarers will join the ISS crew, where they will carry out maintenance and science experiments over a period of six months.

Prelaunch activities, launch, and docking will air live on NASA Television, the NASA app, and the agency’s website. What is SpaceX? Here's what you need to know... SpaceX is a cash-flushed rocket company that wants to take man to Mars. It was set up by eccentric billionaire Elon Musk in 2002 and is based in Hawthorne, California. SpaceX’s first aim was to build rockets that can autonomously land back on Earth for refurbishment and re-use. The technology makes launching and operating space flights more efficient, and therefore cheaper. SpaceX currently uses its reusable Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets to fly cargo to the International Space Station (ISS) for Nasa. It also carries satellites and other space tech into orbit for various government agencies and multinational companies. The company took astronauts to the ISS for the first time in 2020. Other future missions involve carrying tourists to the ISS and astronauts to the Moon and Mars. Musk has repeatedly said he believes humanity must colonise Mars to save itself from extinction. He plans to get a SpaceX rocket to the Red Planet by 2027.

MPs vote to allow water companies to dump raw sewage into rivers and seas,https://metro.co.uk/2021/10/25/tory-mps-vote-to-allow-water-companies-to-dump-raw-sewage-into-rivers-15481391/,"['UK', 'Conservative Party', 'Defra', 'Environment Agency']",['Gergana Krasteva'],,The move has been called 'extremely disappointing'.,"Water companies discharged raw sewage more than 400,000 times last year (Pictures: REX / Getty) The Government has given polluters the green light to pump raw sewage into British rivers and seas in an ‘extremely disappointing’ move. Only 22 Conservative MPs rebelled by voting for an amendment to the Environment Bill, which sought to place a legal duty on water companies not to dump the risky sewage into rivers. The bill, intended to revamp the UK’s environmental regulations post Brexit, currently allows raw sewage to be discharged into the country’s waterways. In 2020, water companies discharged raw sewage more than 400,000 times over a period of 3.1 million hours, according to figures published by the Environment Agency. Sewage pollution is a key component of what MPs were told is a chemical cocktail of pollutants. The vote comes nearly two months after the UK’s departure from the European Union and Covid-19 caused disruptions to the supply chain of key chemicals used by water companies to treat the discharge – similarly to the petrol crisis. In September, the Environment Agency waived rules for businesses struggling to get hold of the required chemicals to ‘discharge effluent without meeting the conditions’ of their permits.

Incoming vaccinations will ‘definitely’ bring child case rates down: Shahab,https://panow.com/2021/10/25/incoming-vaccinations-will-definitely-bring-child-case-rates-down-shahab/,,,,"Through the pandemic, about a third of cases in Saskatchewan have been in kids and teens, so as cases have gone up in Saskatchewan the last few months...","Through the pandemic, about a third of cases in Saskatchewan have been in kids and teens, so as cases have gone up in Saskatchewan the last few months, so have cases in kids. However, those high numbers could change starting next month. Dr. Saqib Shahab, the province’s chief medical health officer, said the province is expecting to receive vaccines for kids in early or mid-November. “We need to be ready that as soon as vaccines come, it is made available for children (aged) five to 11,” said Shahab. “I think all of us with children in that age group should be ready to take the first opportunity to get our children vaccinated.” Shahab didn’t have much more in details beyond that, saying more are to come. Pfizer recently submitted data to Health Canada to get its COVID-19 vaccine approved for use in children aged five to 11. The physician town hall Thursday night — a meeting meant to provide information and answer questions for doctors in the province — talked about pediatric cases of COVID-19. In a presentation, pediatrician Dr. Mahli Brindamour said during the week of Oct. 17 there were 17 kids in hospital, the most there have been. Brindamour also explained that while deaths due to COVID-19 are rare in kids, they do happen. Throughout the country, there have been 18 deaths in children up to the age of 18. In Saskatchewan, three children under 12 have died from COVID-19, which is 16 per cent of all pediatric deaths in Canada. Shahab said the reason child COVID cases make up a third of those in the province is, in part, because kids either couldn’t or still can’t, be vaccinated. But he said that can be mitigated by everyone around kids being vaccinated. “If all parents had a 99 per cent vaccination (rate), and school staff (got vaccinated) – and I see no reason why that shouldn’t happen – even in unvaccinated children under 11, our case numbers would go down to maybe 10, 15 from 90 a day,” said Shahab. Shahab thinks all school and daycare staff should be fully vaccinated or submit to testing if they’re not. Though graphs from the physician town hall show an increase in child cases after the school year started, Shahab said only about 23 per cent of cases health officials could trace come from schools. He said household exposure was 47 per cent and there was a linkage with unvaccinated households. “Most of the schools, when they report a case, it’s one case and a few report two or three cases. I have not seen dozens of cases in schools or large outbreaks in schools. And that speaks to the layers of protection that schools learned how to apply last year and are applying now,” said Shahab. When kids as young as five can get their shots, Shahab said he expects a high uptake in that group “because that’ll then definitely bring rates down in that age group.” —",2021-10-25 15:02:17,"Through the pandemic, about a third of cases in Saskatchewan have been in kids and teens, so as cases have gone up in Saskatchewan the last few months, so have cases in kids.

The news comes as a panel of government advisors was preparing to meet Tuesday on the question of whether to authorize the Pfizer vaccine in kids aged 5-11, with top infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci predicting it would be available by mid-November. “We are encouraged by the immunogenicity and safety profile of mRNA-1273 in children aged 6 to under 12 years and are pleased that the study met its primary immunogenicity endpoints,” Moderna chief executive Stephane Bancel said in a statement. An interim analysis from a mid-to-late stage clinical trial of 4,753 children showed that two doses of vaccine produced a high level of neutralizing antibodies – Y-shaped proteins that bind to the coronavirus and block it from entering human cells. The vaccine was dosed at 50 micrograms, which is half of what is used among adults, but still produced on average 1.5 times as many antibodies in children as it did in young adults given the higher dose. The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate, including fatigue, headache, fever, and injection site pain.

A briefing document posted on the FDA’s website indicated the agency believes benefits outweigh the most worrying side effect for this age group, namely myocarditis, or heart inflammation. “The overall analysis predicted that the numbers of clinically significant COVID-19-related outcomes prevented would clearly outweigh the numbers of vaccine-associated excess myocarditis cases,” the document said. But it acknowledged the benefit-risk calculus would differ when community transmission is very low, as was the case in the United States in June 2021. The FDA also uploaded Pfizer’s efficacy analysis, with the company estimating a two-dose course of its vaccine at 10 micrograms was more than 90 percent effective in preventing symptomatic disease. Overall, more than 150 children aged 5 to 11 have died from Covid in the United States since the start of the pandemic, according to official data. “If all goes well, and we get the regulatory approval and the recommendation from the CDC, it’s entirely possible, if not very likely, that vaccines will be available for children from 5 to 11 within the first week or two of November,” Fauci told ABC News Sunday.

Sarah Buckle is ‘terrified’ at the thought that the culprit is still on the loose, six weeks after she was hosptalised on a night out. The 19-year-old has approached her constituency MP, Theresa May, and the Home Secretary, Priti Patel, calling for clubs to be made to introduce safety and security precautions to protect guests from injections with needles and substances slipped into drinks. The University of Nottingham student said she collapsed and began choking after falling ill on the night out and is ‘really scared’ that whoever was responsible has not been caught by police. After arriving in the club, which she does want to name, at around 11pm her last memory is meeting some friends at the bar before she was discharged from hospital around 10 hours later. Sarah spoke after an outcry over needles being used to spike women with powerful so-called date rape drugs at nightclubs across the UK. ‘It all came out of nowhere,’ she said. ‘My friends said I stopped talking and I tried typing something on my phone but it wasn’t making sense.

Sarah Buckle is ‘terrified’ at the thought that the culprit is still on the loose, six weeks after she was hosptalised on a night out. The 19-year-old has approached her constituency MP, Theresa May , and the Home Secretary, Priti Patel , calling for clubs to be made to introduce safety and security precautions to protect guests from injections with needles and substances slipped into drinks. The University of Nottingham student said she collapsed and began choking after falling ill on the night out and is ‘really scared’ that whoever was responsible has not been caught by police. After arriving in the club, which she does want to name, at around 11pm her last memory is meeting some friends at the bar before she was discharged from hospital around 10 hours later. Sarah spoke after an outcry over needles being used to spike women with powerful so-called date rape drugs at nightclubs across the UK. ‘It all came out of nowhere,’ she said. ‘My friends said I stopped talking and I tried typing something on my phone but it wasn’t making sense.

I believe even if you aren’t yeehaw-crawling-over-broken-glass-to-get-one, that if at all possible, as an act of kindness, as a ‘take-one-for-the-team’, as a ‘let’s do-whatever-we-can-to-make-this- world-better’, that ‘I- would-consider-it-a-personal-favor’, that ‘even-if-you-are sure-you-can-fight-it’, you ‘take-it-for-the-young-and-the-elderly-and-the-healthcare-professionals-and-the-canceled-surgery-patients,’ and on and on. Please. Or unsubscribe, that’s fine. I’ll miss you, but fine. While I typically love readers’ responses to my enewsletter – please save your time if you are an anti-vaxxer, let’s just agree to disagree on this one. *** Now back to our regularly scheduled enews… I didn’t read the manual, I didn’t know what to do, I just made it up, I guessed. And I guessed wrong. My daughter was just 5, getting ready to go to kindergarten and I was gearing up to get her immunizations. And so I told her words that I regret to this very day, “We are going for a surprise!” I don’t know what I could have possibly been thinking – how on earth I thought this was a smart idea but that’s what I did and well you can just imagine the fiasco that ensued. To this day my daughter, now 30, hates surprises and really, really dislikes that I did this to her. I am scarred from scarring her! I am reminded of this long-ago time now because soon COVID vaccines will be available for the children and if I had to do it over again, I would do it so much differently. Maybe something like.. Kara, tomorrow I’m going to take you to get a needle in your arm. It’s probably going to hurt a little bit, I know mine does when I get a needle. I want you to know that you are safe and I’m here for you. The reason we are getting the needle is to help us stay healthy. It hurts a bit and you might want to cry a little and that’s ok, but you will be safe and I’m going to be right here for you and we can cuddle up and be a little sad together when it’s over. But soon after that, it’s not going to hurt anymore and we will go do something fun together. Even though you are getting a needle in your arm, you will be safe, I will be here for you and you can cry if you want to. I would repeat this over and over and over until her vaccine was administered. Parents aren’t perfect, we can’t have a redo – but if we could, I’d sure take it on this particular incident. Somehow it seems kids remember the things we did wrong a lot more than the things we did right. Oh well, if we are lucky they love us anyway. They say, ‘When we know better, we do better.’ I don’t always agree with this sentiment as many times I do know better but I do ‘the other’ anyway! In this case, though, I sure wish I knew better and I sure wish I had done better. Everyone wants to feel safe. People are getting the vaccine to feel safe. Some people are choosing not to get the vaccine because that feels safer for them. In a world already so divided, it makes me so sad we have yet another reason to disagree. We all just want to feel safe – in the end, maybe that can connect us after all. To our health, Steph The post To our health! first appeared on Your Life Unlimited.

An advisory panel for the FDA will consider that company's application on Tuesday.Top health officials, like Dr. Anthony Fauci, have said they believe the vaccine will be approved for emergency use in kids and the U.S. could start seeing the age group being vaccinated in early November.“So if all goes well, and we get the regulatory approval, and the recommendations from the CDC, it's entirely possible, if not, very likely that vaccines will be available for children from 5 to 11 within the first week or two of November,” said Fauci told CNN on Sunday.",2021-10-25 14:28:54,,,wcpo,True,"[('Moderna', 'PERSON'), ('Monday', 'DATE'), ('COVID-19', 'PRODUCT'), ('ages 6 to 11', 'DATE'), ('two 50', 'CARDINAL'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('Moderna', 'PERSON'), ('28 days', 'DATE'), ('Moderna', 'PERSON'), ('Moderna', 'DATE'), ('the Food and Drug Administration', 'ORG'), ('FDA', 'ORG'), ('European Medicines Agency', 'ORG'), ('EMA', 'ORG'), ('6 to under 12 years', 'DATE'), ('Stéphane Bancel', 'PERSON'), ('Moderna', 'GPE'), ('COVID-19', 'ORG'), ('Pfizer', 'PERSON'), ('ages 5 to 11', 'DATE'), ('FDA', 'ORG'), ('Tuesday', 'DATE'), ('Anthony Fauci', 'PERSON'), ('U.S.', 'GPE'), ('early November', 'DATE'), ('CDC', 'ORG'), ('5 to 11', 'CARDINAL'), ('the first week', 'DATE'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('November', 'DATE'), ('Fauci', 'ORG'), ('CNN', 'ORG'), ('Sunday', 'DATE')]"

But, unfortunately for those feeling a bit queasy, it does involved more booze… Getty - ContributorYou could beat your hangover with one simple trick… But an expert warns it could be dangerous[/caption] Dr Karl Kruszelnicki shared his simple trick to bounce back from the abyss after a heavy night. The 73-year-old from Australia told listers of his podcast: “Unfortunately, a cure is just a bit of alcohol – the hair of the dog – which is a bad pathway to go down.” This is because drinking more alcohol stops the body absorbing methanol – a toxic chemical found in booze. It instead forces the body to deal with the new ethanol (the main proportion of alcohol). However, this isn’t helpful in the long run, as you do have to face the music and absorb the methanol at some point. And, the expert warns some people can feel so much better they then lean towards developing alcoholism.

BRAIN GAME The 7 simple lifestyle hacks that can help reduce your risk of Alzheimer's SPOT THE DIFFERENCE Shocking X-rays reveal the huge difference Covid vaccines really make SWEET RELIEF The secret hack using just your hands that can 'cure' constipation So while it is a sure fire way to feel immediately more human, he said the safest way is to simply ride it out. Drink lots of water, eat what you fancy and get some sleep and you should beat the hangover in no time. Of course, the best way to avoid a hangover is to drink moderately on the night. Lining your stomach with a carb or fat-heavy meal before boozing slows down the rate of alcohol absorption, something you’ll be thankful for in the morning. Also, it can be handy to avoid dark-coloured drinks that contain natural chemicals called congeners (impurities), which irritate blood vessels and tissue in the brain and can make a hangover much worse. Other ways to soother a hangover: 1. Rehydrate Booze can make you expel up to four times as much water, which is why you always feel like a slug in a salt mine the morning after. Make sure you drink lots of water before you go to sleep, but well, we all know how hard that is once you’ve knocked back a thousand tequilas and passed out on the front step. GP Sarah Garsed at online health and wellness platform RWL says water is your best friend and will flush toxins out of your system. Isotonic drinks can also give you an extra boost and replace lost fluids. 2. Snooze Alcohol loves to rob us of good quality sleep. This is because it inhibits the release of the sleep hormone melatonin, meaning it can be hard to get to sleep, difficult to have good quality sleepand you may also find you wake up early unable to get back to sleep. “Sleep is one of the most restorative things for a hangover so if youneed it, take a nap the following day” Dr Sarah added. 3. Medicate Reach for the painkillers to help with head or muscle aches. Stick to paracetamol-based remedies as aspirin can increase nausea. Take an antacid if you have a dodgy stomach and need it settling. 4. Drink herbal tea As well as plenty of water, hot drinks can help revive your body and mind. Ginger tea can help with nausea and milk thistle tea cleanses the liver, while hot water with honey and lemon boosts blood sugar. 5. Exercise if you can Depending on how bad your hangover is, exercise might seem like the last thing you want to do, BUT it could be the best thing for you, Dr Sarah says. After drinking a lot of your natural feel-good brain chemicals can be left significantly reduced, leaving you feeling low in energy and mood. 6. Eat something If your hangover is particularly bad and you are struggling to stomach much food, try a cold orange juice to get yourself back to being match ready. “Orange juice can have a acid-neutralising effect when it is metabolised by the body and delivers a big does of potassium which helps to rehydrate you and restore any lost minerals. “Orange juice is also high in natural sugar, which can help bring that low blood sugar up and reduce feelings of nausea”, Dr Sarah said.

Amazon brings Alexa to hospitals and senior living centers,https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/amazon-brings-alexa-to-hospitals-and-senior-living-centers/,"['Hardware', 'Health']",['Sarah Perez'],,"After already targeting verticals like hotels and apartment complexes, Amazon announced today it’s now rolling out new solutions for healthcare providers and senior living centers.

The solutions, which are a part of Alexa Smart Properties, are designed specifically to meet the needs of deploying Alexa devices at scale and will allow the facility’s administrators to create customized experiences for their residents or patients. In senior living centers, the residents would be able to use Alexa devices to call their family members and other loved ones, as well as keep up with the goings-on at their community and other community news. The devices could also be used to make announcements, allow the residents to communicate with each other through direct audio messages, make voice and video calls, and they can streamline other center activities — like check-ins, maintenance requests, and various administrative tasks. Amazon believes this could help make facilities more efficient and productive. Amazon says senior living communities include Atria and Eskaton will integrate with its new solution. The market for using Alexa in senior living communities was already being explored by third-party providers, like K4Connect, which last year closed on $21 million in Series B funding to bring newer technologies, including Alexa’s voice assistance, to older adults and those living with disabilities. Companies like K4Connect and others, including Lifeline Senior Living, Aiva, and Vocera, can now tap into Alexa Smart Properties’ tools and APIs to make it easier for them to roll out their own, customized solutions and software. Image Credits: Amazon Meanwhile, Amazon had already piloted putting Alexa in patient rooms in a test with Cedars-Sinai, which allowed patients to use voice commands for performing basic tasks, like changing TV channels, as well as communicating with caregivers. The idea was that, by offloading some of the everyday tasks to Alexa, it could free up nurses to focus more on medical care. With Amazon’s new solution for hospitals, patients will be able to use Alexa to communicate with care staff, control the devices in their room, and stay entertained with news and music. Healthcare providers can also communicate with their patients using Alexa features like calling and Drop-In, without having to enter the patient rooms. This could also help hospitals be more productive and conserve their medical supplies and protective equipment like gloves, masks, and gowns, notes Amazon. (PPE shortages had been an ongoing issue in some locations as Covid spiked during the pandemic.) Cedars-Sinai is among those officially rolling out the Alexa Smart Properties solution, following its pilot program, and is joined by BayCare and Houston Methodist, Amazon says. “Voice is intuitive for patients, regardless of age or tech-savviness,” said Peachy Hain, executive director of Medical and Surgical Services at Cedars-Sinai, in a statement. “Since it’s so easy to operate, patients can use Alexa to connect with their care team and stay entertained as soon as they settle in, while care providers can streamline tasks to make more time to care for those patients. It’s a total gamechanger for enhancing our hospital experience,” Hain added. Though Amazon has struggled with privacy issues related to its use of voice recordings and transcriptions, the healthcare and senior living center solutions will not save the voice recordings and don’t require users to share personal info with Alexa to use the device, the company explains. Users can also mute the Echo’s microphone at any time with the button on top. Amazon also claims it safeguards protected health information received through HIPAA-eligible Alexa skill interactions. Amazon has been working to bring Alexa to healthcare facilities for some time. A report in 2018 by CNBC had said the company was building out a healthcare team with Alexa in order to make the voice assistant useful in the industry. This included working through the complex HIPAA regulations that would be required to do so.

Locsin recalled the 75th anniversary of the UN in 2020, which was marked “in a somber mood” because of COVID-19, and said that “though we are still not out of the woods, we now have the knowledge and tools to fight it: vaccines, medicines, and informed policies.” In particular, Locsin acknowledged the COVAX facility, “without which, the Philippines’ COVID vaccination program would still be languishing.” In addition to the COVAX vaccines, Gonzalez reported that through some 150 different initiatives of the UN Country Team in the Philippines, by the end of 2020, more than 5 million at risk individuals were able to access essential health services, and more than 6 million boys and girls were supported with distance learning. Equally, Locsin lauded the “milestone initiative of the Philippines-United Nations Joint Programme on collaboration in human rights between the UN and a government.” “I thank UN Resident Coordinator and my good friend Gustavo Gonzalez.

The three-year UN joint programme was developed to implement Human Rights Council (HRC) resolution 45/33, adopted on 7 October 2020, which outlined specific areas for capacity-building and technical cooperation for the promotion and protection of human rights in the Philippines. The joint programme document was signed by Department of Justice (DOJ) Secretary Menardo Guevarra, Locsin and Gonzalez, with the late Jose Luis Gascon of the Commission on Human Rights in attendance.

Looking ahead, Gonzalez said that the UN in the Philippines will support the Philippines to finance efforts to build forward better from COVID-19. “We have set one priority with the government for the coming year which is to help set up a diversified financing framework that will leverage additional resources for COVID-19 recovery and getting SDGs back on track.” “Ultimately the success of the United Nations team must be measured in the difference we make in people’s lives….

Read Full Article at RT.com,"Unvaccinated tennis stars could be set to compete at January's Australian Open after an email sent to WTA players which seems to contradict local Covid-19 public health restrictions was leaked to the media. Victoria, the Australian state which will host the tournament early next year, has recently introduced a vaccine mandate for all professional athletes seeking to compete within its borders – however, the email leaked online by tennis reporter Ben Rothenberg suggests that unvaccinated players will be allowed to participate if certain conditions are followed, such as quarantining for 14 days upon arrival into the country.  It had previously been though that a host of high-profile vaccine holdouts in the sport would be ineligible to compete unless they received a full dose of one of the several available vaccines. Also on rt.com ‘I will not reveal my status’: Djokovic claims it would be ‘inappropriate’ to declare whether he is vaccinated as visa issue looms World number one Novak Djokovic is thought to fall under this category after recently refusing to state whether or not he had received an inoculation against the virus. Djokovic has won an incredible nine Australian Open titles, including the last three in a row, and another win in the first Grand Slam of 2022 would separate the Serb from a pack which also includes Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal as the player with the most Grand Slam titles in history.  🐨Update on #AusOpen🐨Per email sent to WTA players just now, Tennis Australia has told WTA PC that fully vaccinated players won’t be required to quarantine or bubble at all.Unvaccinated players will be allowed to enter, TA tells WTA, but must do 14 days of hotel quarantine. pic.twitter.com/cu4NV8abYB— Ben Rothenberg (@BenRothenberg) October 24, 2021 Per the email published to social media by Rothenberg, players who remain unvaccinated ""must submit to regular testing"".

It had previously been though that a host of high-profile vaccine holdouts in the sport would be ineligible to compete unless they received a full dose of one of the several available vaccines. World number one Novak Djokovic is thought to fall under this category after recently refusing to state whether or not he had received an inoculation against the virus. Djokovic has won an incredible nine Australian Open titles, including the last three in a row, and another win in the first Grand Slam of 2022 would separate the Serb from a pack which also includes Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal as the player with the most Grand Slam titles in history. 🐨Update on #AusOpen 🐨Per email sent to WTA players just now, Tennis Australia has told WTA PC that fully vaccinated players won’t be required to quarantine or bubble at all.Unvaccinated players will be allowed to enter, TA tells WTA, but must do 14 days of hotel quarantine. pic.twitter.com/cu4NV8abYB Per the email published to social media by Rothenberg, players who remain unvaccinated "" must submit to regular testing "".

The company's portfolio of drugs in these two fields generates billions of dollars in revenue every quarter. It is currently looking to increase its market share in the coronavirus vaccine space. This year, Johnson & Johnson expects to record $2.5 billion in sales from its COVID-19 vaccine, which falls well short of the $33.5 billion and $20 billion in revenue, respectively, that Pfizer and Moderna expect. Fortunately, some recent developments bode well for Johnson & Johnson's ambitions in this lucrative market. Most COVID vaccines currently available in the U.S. are administered in two doses given about a month apart. Johnson & Johnson's vaccine, Ad26.COV2.S, is administered in only one dose. Based on real-world data and a phase 3 clinical trial, the company believes a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S is 75% effective against severe cases of COVID at least 28 days post-vaccination.Continue reading",2021-10-25 10:50:00,"Johnson & Johnson ( NYSE:JNJ ) is a leader in several pharmaceutical areas of research, including oncology and immunological disease.

Fortunately, some recent developments bode well for Johnson & Johnson's ambitions in this lucrative market. Notching another win Most COVID vaccines currently available in the U.S. are administered in two doses given about a month apart. Johnson & Johnson's vaccine, Ad26.COV2.S, is administered in only one dose. Based on real-world data and a phase 3 clinical trial, the company believes a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S is 75% effective against severe cases of COVID at least 28 days post-vaccination. This efficacy compares unfavorably to that offered by the vaccines marketed by Pfizer and Moderna, and the one developed by Novavax, which has yet to earn Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in the U.S. All three proved at least 90% effective at preventing COVID in clinical studies. Image source: Getty Images. However, Johnson & Johnson recently released data showing that a booster dose (or a second dose) of its vaccine given two months after the first helps increase its efficacy to 94% against critical COVID illness. On Oct. 5, the company applied for an EUA to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a booster dose of its vaccine. Then, on Oct. 15, a panel of experts convened by the FDA unanimously voted in favor of the agency granting the company an EUA. On Oct. 20, the FDA granted the company this much-anticipated authorization. What does this mean for investors? Besides earning the regulatory green light a bit later than some of its competitors, Johnson & Johnson's COVID vaccine has encountered its share of headwinds. In mid-April, health authorities decided to pause the rollout of the vaccine after it was suspected of causing blood clots in some patients (it had originally earned an EUA in late February). Regulators lifted this pause roughly a week and a half later, arguing that the known benefits outweigh the known risks, and required a new label warning on the vaccine moving forward. Indeed, this adverse event was known to have affected six patients out of more than 6.8 million who had been vaccinated. This episode is in the rearview mirror now, and with the pandemic still not over, mainly due to the more-contagious delta variant of the virus, there is still a need for vaccines. Since a second dose of Ad26.COV2.S seems to boost its efficacy, that can only be good for its sales. That's especially the case given that the FDA did not put any health-related (or similar) restrictions on who can receive a booster dose of Johnson & Johnson's vaccine. But here's the catch: The company vowed not to profit from this product for the duration of the pandemic. In other words, increased sales of Ad26.COV2.S in the near term will have no meaningful impact on its bottom line. In the future, the company may profit from Ad26.COV2.S once the pandemic subsides and if COVID becomes a seasonal disease like the flu, as some have predicted . But even then, considering how competitive this market is, Ad26.COV2.S will only have a very modest impact on a company that typically generates more than $10 billion in profit every year. In other words, it is not the best idea to invest in Johnson & Johnson because of its COVID vaccine. Fortunately, there are plenty of other reasons to do so. Consider the company's diversified operations. Its pharmaceutical business, the largest by revenue, includes quite a few blockbuster products that continue to grow their sales. To pick a couple out of the bunch, the immunosuppressant Stelara racked up $2.4 billion in revenue in the third quarter (ending Sept. 30), 22.2% higher than the prior-year quarter. Cancer medicine Darzalex grew its sales by 43.7% year over year to $1.6 billion. Those are just the tip of the iceberg for the company, and it has several dozen programs in its late-stage pipeline. Label expansions and new drug approvals are routine for Johnson & Johnson. And its consumer health segment sells over-the-counter products with strong name recognition, including Listerine, Neutrogena, Aveeno, and Tylenol. The company's medical devices business adds to its revenue base. Here's one more reason to invest in the company: It has raised its dividend annually for more than 50 consecutive years, making it a Dividend King . It currently offers a yield of 2.53%, higher than the S&P 500 's 1.38%, and it's maintained a conservative cash payout ratio of 47%. That makes it an attractive option for income-seeking investors. In short, Johnson & Johnson may not be the best COVID vaccine stock to buy, but it remains a solid pharma company to invest in.",,fool,True,"[('Johnson & Johnson', 'ORG'), ('NYSE', 'ORG'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('billions of dollars', 'MONEY'), ('This year', 'DATE'), ('Johnson & Johnson', 'ORG'), ('$2.5 billion', 'MONEY'), ('COVID-19', 'PRODUCT'), ('$33.5 billion', 'MONEY'), ('$20 billion', 'MONEY'), ('Pfizer', 'PERSON'), ('Moderna', 'PERSON'), (""Johnson & Johnson's"", 'ORG'), ('U.S.', 'GPE'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('about a month', 'DATE'), (""Johnson & Johnson's"", 'ORG'), ('only one', 'CARDINAL'), ('3', 'CARDINAL'), ('75%', 'PERCENT'), ('COVID', 'PERSON'), ('at least 28 days', 'DATE')]"

GEORGE TOWN, Oct 25 — The International Congress and Convention Association (ICCA) Asia Pacific chapter has proposed that the Malaysian government work with several countries to develop a special pass for business travellers attending international conferences.The chapter’s chairman, Ashwin Gunasekeran, said this would ease travel requirements for business travellers who needed to attend international meetings, congress or conferences for official reasons.“If some countries are to work together to come up with one pass for business travellers, it would make it easier for them to attend international conferences and events for business purposes,” he said in an interview with Malay Mail today.He said currently, some business travellers must undergo quarantine twice or more if they need to travel several countries, in addition to undergoing different Covid-19 testing procedures.The proposed business pass would make the process smoother for these travellers as it would allow them to travel to their destinations after being tested for Covid-19, he said.Malaysia could work with several countries to develop such a system, he said when adding that it would allow seamless travel for participants of international business events.Ashwin, who is also Penang Convention & Exhibition Bureau (PCEB) chief executive officer, said the meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions (MICE) industry is now picking up as countries reopen their borders.However, there was still uncertainty and lack of standardisation among countries in terms of regulations and requirements for accepting international visitors.Among others, he said this included the non-recognition of some Covid-19 vaccines or vaccination administered in certain countries.“Some countries require their own Covid-19 testing so even if the visitor has undergone a swab test prior to arriving, the visitor may have to do it again at the country he arrived at,” he said.Ashwin said this meant a multi-destination business traveller would have to be tested repeatedly in close succession or undergo lengthy quarantines for brief visits.The proposed travel visa would reduce such restrictions and promote business travel as well as MICE activity in the country, he said.",2021-10-25 10:00:19,,,malaymail,True,"[('Asia Pacific', 'LOC'), ('Ashwin Gunasekeran', 'PERSON'), ('Tropical Spice Garden', 'ORG'), ('October 25, 2021', 'DATE'), ('Sayuti Zainudin Follow', 'PERSON'), ('Instagram', 'ORG'), ('Telegram', 'ORG'), ('GEORGE TOWN', 'PERSON'), ('Oct 25', 'DATE'), ('The International Congress and Convention Association', 'ORG'), ('Asia Pacific', 'LOC'), ('Malaysian', 'NORP'), ('Ashwin Gunasekeran', 'PERSON'), ('congress', 'ORG'), ('Malay Mail', 'ORG'), ('today', 'DATE'), ('Malaysia', 'GPE'), ('Penang Convention & Exhibition Bureau', 'ORG'), ('PCEB', 'ORG'), ('Ashwin', 'PERSON')]"

He termed the project an important document on the history of Arunachal Pradesh at a meeting with the members of the core committee and sub-committee for the recognition of the State's unsung heroes, here on Saturday. The State government had in September formed a five-member core committee headed by Mein to conduct research on the contribution of various personalities of the state in the country's freedom struggle. The committee has been tasked with collecting and examining authentic documents, archives, journals, available in the libraries and other places, seeking comments of eminent personalities and others in this regard, visiting places of relevant historical interests and taking steps as deemed fit to give recognition to the unsung freedom fighters of Arunachal. The research work and documentation, after being compiled and completed, would be forwarded to the State government. Chief Minister Pema Khandu who has been spearheading the initiative had told the Assembly in September that the State government would build a memorial for all the ""unsung"" freedom fighters from the State, besides requesting the Centre to also honour them. Mein on the occasion also informed the members of the house that the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR), a captive body of the Union Ministry of Education, is planning to conduct a workshop-cum-seminar in the State early next year as part of Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav. He asked Rajiv Gandhi University Vice-Chancellor Saket Kushwaha and member secretary of the core committee, Dani Salu, to coordinate with the member-secretary of ICHR. Meanwhile, the house present decided to propose the ICHR to set up a centre in Arunachal Pradesh. Such a centre in the State would facilitate the research scholars and students carrying out research works and studies on the rich history and culture of Arunachal Pradesh, the members of the panel said. The committee also decided to participate in the live online series on social media on unsung heroes which would be conducted by ICHR. Prof Kushwaha during the meeting, presented a timeline to be followed by the sub-committee which shall work under the aegis of the RGU.

The Director-General of WHO, Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus said this in his address at the World Health Summit on Sunday. According to him, the pandemic will end when the world chooses to end it. “Twelve years since the first World Health Summit, we meet once again in the shadow of a pandemic. And we are faced once again with some very big questions: some of the same ones we were asking in 2009 that remain unanswered, and some new ones. “One of the questions I am asked most often is: when will the pandemic end? My answer is that the pandemic will end when the world chooses to end it. It’s in our hands. We have all the tools we need: effective public health tools and effective medical tools. “But the world has not used those tools well. With almost 50 thousand deaths a week, the pandemic is far from over – and that’s just the reported deaths,” Ghebreyesus said. The WHO chief noted that the target to vaccinate 40 percent of the population of every country by the end of this year is reachable if the countries and companies that control supply match their statements with actions. “The barrier is not production. The barriers are politics and profit. It’s clear what needs to happen. The countries that have already reached the 40 percent target – including all G20 countries – must give their place in the vaccine delivery queue to COVAX and the African Vaccines Acquisition Trust, or AVAT; The G20 countries must fulfil their dose-sharing commitments immediately. “Manufacturers must prioritize and fulfil their contracts with COVAX and AVAT as a matter of urgency, and be far more transparent about what is going where. “And they must share know-how, technology, and licences, and waive intellectual property rights. We’re not asking for charity; we’re calling for a common-sense investment in the global recovery,” he said. He urged countries to end the pandemic by pulling out all the stops to reach the target of vaccinating 40 percent of the population by the end of this year. “The pandemic has demonstrated beyond doubt that health is not a luxury for the rich, or simply an outcome of development; it’s a fundamental human right, and the basis of social, economic, and political stability. “There’s only one way to achieve these three things – and that’s together. No country can end the pandemic in isolation from the rest of the world. And no country can protect the health of its own people without working to protect the health of all people. “It takes some tough negotiations and some tough decisions.

And he called on the five millions Brits who haven’t yet had the vaccine at all to come forward this winter. Asked if he agrees with Boris Johnson that this Christmas will be much better than last year’s, he replied: “Yes, of course. “For all of those like me hoping and planning for a normal Christmas – I do think that’s where we’ll be – if you want that let’s keep playing our part.” Mr Javid said people should “be cautious and take sensible actions to try and prevent the spread of the virus” as winter closes in. In particular he urged people to start taking Lateral Flow Tests before going to visit elderly relatives. He also said Brits should wear masks in crowded public places and keep up basic hygiene practices like hand washing. No Plan B Mr Javid insisted the pandemic data doesn’t yet show that the Government needs to trigger Plan B. He said: “We are not at that point. Whether we get there or not, we will see. “But the best thing we can all do to try and prevent us moving to Plan B or taking any further measures is to get out there and get our vaccines.” The health secretary also said he is “leaning towards” making jabs mandatory for all NHS workers within weeks.

Professor Stephen Powis said people must “take up the offer” of a third dose to “protect the freedom and Christmas that we have all earned”. Mr Javid said the booster rollout has “picked up substantially” in recent days as more and more people come forward. A record 800,000 jabs were administered during the final three days of last week, including 325,140 on Saturday alone. And the PM was also handed another major boost as scientists predicted Covid cases will plummet within weeks without the need for Plan B. Experts believe the number of new infections could sink from 50,000 a day now to just 5,000 in time for Christmas.

How this Oklahoma ranch is using nuclear families to upend the foster care system,https://www.deseret.com/2021/10/24/22661072/how-this-oklahoma-ranch-is-using-nuclear-families-to-upend-the-foster-care-system-peppers-ranch,,['Naomi Schaefer Riley'],,,"Photo Illustration by Alex Cochran, Deseret News Most often sibling groups are either separated or tend to languish in foster care. Peppers Ranch is changing that Desie’s eyes grow wide as she looks over the menu at Cattlemen’s Steakhouse, a popular destination with tourists, local families and even cowboys in the Stockyards area outside of Oklahoma City. The 8-year-old Desie does not get to go out for dinner often — the nine other children in her family make that logistically and financially challenging — but that does not stop this soon-to-be third grader from sharing her adventurous tastes. “I’m going to start with the shrimp cocktail,” she announces to the half of our group of 14 sitting at one table. Desie came to stay with Ashlee and Matt Terry when she was 8 days old. It was part of a “Home for the Holidays” emergency placement. Desie came to the Terrys right after Thanksgiving in 2012 while child welfare services figured out what to do with her; she never left. Desie was actually the fourth child placed with the Terrys. Their first placements were in 2011 — sisters Evie and Piper — and then their biological sister Bella a few months later. In 2014, with four daughters, three bedrooms and only one shower, they decided they did not have the space for more. Ashlee recalls: “I said that when God provided more bathrooms, we would reopen our home.” God seemed to answer their prayer when they were offered a spot at Peppers Ranch, a community in Guthrie, about 30 minutes from Oklahoma City. The ranch harnesses an old-fashioned understanding of family, neighborhood and community to solve the problems of a new generation of displaced children. Opened in 2002, with the donation of 160 acres of land, Peppers Ranch was originally a residential facility for abused and neglected boys. The donor, Hal French, a local oil and gas entrepreneur, had grown up near a boys home and often played with the children there, and wanted to create a similar opportunity for more kids. After a few years, things seemed to be going OK for the boys who came to Peppers Ranch. But their sisters were just being dropped off at a local shelter. The girls had no equivalent and, more importantly, the siblings were losing their connection to one another. Which got French and the other folks at Peppers Ranch to thinking. According to research from Casey Family Programs, “approximately two-thirds of children in foster care have a sibling in care, and yet — despite the benefits of joint sibling placements — it is estimated that more than 70% of children with siblings are separated from one or more of their siblings while in care.” Benefits of placing siblings together include lower incidence of behavioral problems and a higher chance they will both like and adapt to their foster homes and have better academic performance. But finding foster or adoptive families that have the capacity to take in sibling groups is hard. Even if parents have an extra bed in their home or are willing to take in two siblings, what are the chances they have the space (let alone the time and energy) to take in three or four? The result is that sibling groups are either separated or tend to languish in foster care for longer. And so Peppers Ranch tried something different. In 2009, after extensive studies, the leadership decided to move to a family model, offering couples who were already licensed to do foster care in Oklahoma the opportunity to move to Peppers Ranch. There they could live in one of the newly built houses, paying only a couple of hundred dollars in rent and receiving a small stipend in addition to what the state offered for foster care, if they were willing to open their home to at least five foster children. Today, there are 16 homes on the property (with plans to build a few more over the next few years), all more than 3,000 square feet. The typical home has four bedrooms, a large living area and an industrial-size kitchen and pantry. The more recent homes even have hookups for two washers and dryers as well as larger garages in which families can park their super-size vans. The entire community has an annual budget of about $1.5 million, all from private donations. In addition to money, locals also donate furniture, clothing and other necessities. Hundreds of volunteers help maintain the grounds and run programs for the kids. Spark Creative One of the homes Peppers Ranch provides to its foster families. Set amid farmlands at the end of a dirt road which is prone to flooding, the community may seem inconvenient to some, but for the families at Peppers Ranch, it offers everything they need. The landscape feels a little sparse — not enough time has passed for many trees to mature on the land. Each family has a backyard, equipped with all the trampolines and play structures you would find in a typical suburban neighborhood. There is also a community basketball court and soccer field, a playground and pool complex, a pond where the kids can fish, and a barn with 17 horses. The horses, many of which are older and have been donated in their retirement, are used for equestrian therapy. They are gentle and the kids enjoy helping to care for them. Indeed, one of the Peppers Ranch mothers told me how excited her 6-year-old adoptive son was when he was given his very own pooper scooper for the horses. “They need my help,” he would tell his mother before running over to the barn. Each family also has to help with chores around the community — including feeding the horses over a weekend when the trainer is not around. The logistics of being a foster parent, especially with multiple children in the home, can be overwhelming. Multiple therapy appointments a week, in addition to arranging visitation with biological parents, meetings with social workers and court dates can make even the most organized person’s head spin. But Peppers Ranch brings at least some of those services to the community. There is a learning center where children can receive after-school tutoring. The ranch also offers art therapy, dance therapy, a swim team and a variety of other extracurricular activities. Parents pay a small fee for these out of the stipends they receive. The community requires at least one parent to work full time. But the subsidized housing at Peppers Ranch means one parent can stay home full time — and most of the time they do. With so many kids, especially ones who have behavioral and emotional challenges, it is hard to outsource child care. But the state stipends do not allow a typical middle-class foster family to give up one income. In families with older kids, mothers sometimes have part-time jobs they can do from home during school hours. Mostly it’s the mothers at home but in at least one case it’s the father who cares for the children while the mother works as a hospital nurse. Whoever stays home, the arrangement is a relief for parents. Dustin Burpo, a family pastor at a nearby church and a parent at Peppers Ranch, tells me that he and his wife recently looked at their budget. “We’ve got a house to stay in, a nice house that has plenty of space for our large capacity living” — the Burpos have eight children — “It truly gives you that peace of mind. It’s a weight off my shoulders, knowing that I’ve got a place for my kids.” But it’s not just the homes. It’s the community. Most of the families give their kids freedom to roam. Matt Terry says that’s one of the things he likes about Peppers Ranch, that it feels like a more old-fashioned neighborhood. It’s certainly true that it’s small enough for everyone to know everyone else. Shelly Blankenship, who has been at Peppers Ranch since 2011 and fostered around 80 children here, compares it to when she grew up across the street from her grandmother and down the street from her aunt. “You couldn’t get away with anything.” When she sees kids misbehaving at Peppers Ranch, she will say, “I don’t think you need to be doing that.” They will ask if she is going to tell their mother. Her response? “Do I need to tell her? If you’re going to quit and act right, then I don’t have to tell her anything. We’ve already taken care of it.” Even if they lived in such a neighborhood today, though, parents of foster children and children adopted out of foster care often have a much more difficult calculation about giving their children freedom. Should you let a kid wander around a neighborhood knowing that they have been traumatized by other adults? Are there psychological and behavioral problems that could pop up if something scares them or surprises them? How will other adults respond? Will their fellow parents blame them if something goes wrong? And this is really the genius of Peppers Ranch. It is a supportive community filled with other children who have gone through similar things and other adults who are trying to help those children. While many of the families at Peppers Ranch have found some level of support for their foster care efforts among friends and family, they often felt isolated before they came here. “You have behaviors for a child and you think that something is wrong with me as a parent,” says Kristin Burpo, Dustin’s wife. “You just feel judged, even in a church community,” she tells me. At Peppers Ranch, veteran parents often serve as mentors to the newer ones. The mothers meet at least once a month to talk about the issues that they are facing with their children, where to find resources to help, how to deal with the emotional toll that fostering is taking on them, their marriages, and even their other children. Most research shows that about half of all foster parents quit within their first year. Kristin Martinez understands why. Martinez, who has one biological child and seven adopted children, remembers the day she took in a 16-year-old girl. “I never had a teenager before. I could immediately go to other neighbors and they were able to provide me with great information and great resources.” Her children are playing in the backyard when I arrive, but then come in and sit down with us, periodically asking when it will be time to go get snow cones. She also describes the other trials of being a foster parent, including the “heartbreak” of having a child leave after a long time to go back to their biological family. She asks me to imagine having a child live with you for a year or more, having him or her become part of your children’s lives and then never seeing them again. Or what about “when you’re going through the heartbreak of going to all the court dates”? Martinez recalls “the heartbreak of the biological parents never getting it together. Witnessing the heartbreak that happens to your child. It’s a very emotional roller coaster, this life.” A couple of her older kids nod in agreement. She finds it reassuring that “there’s somebody here to understand that. When you’re having a really hard day and you’re in tears because it’s so hard,” she says, it means so much to her “to have people that literally understand exactly what you’re going through. … To have people that you can do this life with is pretty special.” There is also a network of support for children who live at Peppers Ranch and did not come from foster care. Few people can understand the journey of biological children whose parents keep bringing new children into the home. As Shelly Blankenship acknowledges, “My kids weren’t from trauma, but I put trauma in their lives.” But being at Peppers Ranch has helped her children process that. Rather than putting all this emotional chaos behind her, her daughter, who is now 25, has guardianship over a 17-year-old in the system. Kristin Burpo appreciates that her children see “unconditional love” in her home and in the other homes at Peppers Ranch. “This is always my prayer, that they would see my heart in all of it. And no matter the child that comes in my home, they’re my child when they’re in my home.” Memory McElhaney The Burpo family enjoys some time on the beach. During COVID-19, the community created its own bubble. The kids would still play with each other, going on field trips to state parks some days. The moms would get together, pick up some food and sit in one of their vans to get a break from the kids. “We did that once a week just to try to keep our sanity,” Kristin recalls. The Burpos had two biological children when they took in Shanaya, their first foster child from a family that her husband’s brother (a pastor) knew from his church. Even in a community that was welcoming, she worried that their children might stick out. “Our daughter is black and we are white. It was a little bit awkward” in the small town they lived in before Peppers Ranch. “Coming out here, we know that Shanaya would grow up not feeling odd. Coming to a community where everybody was accepted the way they were because it was just normal. … That was really big for us.” Since moving to Peppers Ranch, they have adopted two sets of siblings: Shakota, 8, Sky, 7, and Trinity, 6; and JC, 4, and Keisha, 3. When I visit their house the chaos is controlled. Kristin is folding laundry. The older kids have helped the younger kids get their sandwiches for lunch and they are passing around the largest container of cheese balls I have ever seen. Three of the younger kids go to watch cartoons when they are done. The family has just come back from a vacation Bible school camp and they are trying to get back into a routine. Dustin, their father, is a pastor at a church about 40 minutes away. Peppers Ranch is not a faith-based organization but every one of the families there is guided in some way by their religious beliefs. Ashley Hahn, the director of the ranch, says they have all “felt called through faith to this walk.” She tells me, “I’m a person of faith. I don’t know how you could do it without knowing the Lord is on your side.” Most of the Burpo kids ignore me, but one of the girls takes me on a grand tour of the house, showing me what’s inside of each of the closets, introducing me to the cat. She seems to crave attention in a way that would be typical for an outgoing 7-year-old. And she clearly enjoys showing off for guests. But then she starts taking watermelon rinds out of the garbage and chewing on them. When Dustin notices, he is calm but firm, asking her to stop. After she does it again, he takes her aside, offering a sterner but still completely calm warning. The kids, as Kristin explains to me over the third basket of laundry, have all manner of diagnoses. A number were born with drugs in their systems. Others watched their parents physically abuse each other and experienced severe neglect as they were shuttled back and forth among parents too strung out to care for them and grandparents who were overwhelmed. Providing a stable environment with love and clear boundaries is important, but the Burpos have tried to consider in other ways how they parent. Almost everyone at Peppers Ranch has been through training in how to deal with kids who have experienced trauma. Dustin also says he talks to other fathers at the ranch about their unique role. Many of the kids have no responsible adult male in their lives. “We are fathers to the fatherless.” Dustin, who counts himself lucky for growing up with a father and a stepfather, says he fears for these kids, many of whom “don’t know who their biological father is and they probably never will know. I get to fill that role. And it’s very humbling and scary at the same time.” Peppers Ranch families think about the building blocks of a normal family and how to re-create them for kids who have come out of dysfunctional homes. Kristin has seen up close how vital it is for sibling groups to stay together. It’s difficult for younger kids because they want to have at least one of the older people they look up to present in their lives. But “when it’s an older child taking care of a younger child and then they are split, … the older child was the caretaker and then they have no purpose.” Ashlee and Matt met doing a training offered by the Oklahoma Department of Health Services. She was training to be a caseworker, helping foster children find permanency. He was training to be a child abuse investigator. It wasn’t long before they were married and began taking in foster children themselves. Matt says that Ashlee is the one in charge of all the logistics of the family and making sure everything works, but it’s clear that his experience working with this population of children has driven him here as well.

Desie takes advantage of her moment of hesitation to explain, “I think you need to find a man first!” In some ways, Peppers Ranch has a sort of artificial feel. The current families have to meet with potential new families and decide whether they should be able to move in. Families can only stay in the community as long as their homes are open to foster children, even if only on a temporary basis. A number of families have ended their foster care “journeys” after a few years and children from other homes talk about missing their friends. Of course, this could happen in any neighborhood. Ashlee Terry Children play on the property of Peppers Ranch. Peppers Ranch does try to provide continuity for kids in other ways. They have a “Grandma” program, in which older people who have either moved on from fostering or who simply want to help out, can live in one of a few small apartments in the community. They form their own relationships with the kids, inviting them over to bake cookies or help with homework. They host playdates for the little ones to give the moms a break and organize art projects for the older kids. One of the new grandmas, Kim Magallanes, moved here from California after her son and daughter-in-law came a few years ago. She is retired but filled with energy and has started to build relationships with the kids. She also has experience with horses and plans to help out in the barn as well. She keeps a stash of carrots in her refrigerator in case one of the kids comes by and wants to go feed them. Kim remembers when she was a child “going to my grandparents’ house, things that I now realize were chores, were fun. Hanging clothes on the line and picking berries and learning how to bake.” Being a grandmother at Peppers Ranch is “just being another person these kids can hang out with.” She’s taking a group of the teenagers on a trip to a camp a few hours away a couple of days after we meet. Other communities have attempted to harness the power and time of an older generation to build connections with foster children. In an article called “It Takes a Multigenerational Village to Raise Foster Kids” the authors who work at an organization called Hope Meadows describe how they have created communities in which foster families live in close proximity to older adults. The programs, which are funded in part with public dollars, offer “intergenerational art and other classes, weekly community dinners, and a community garden, where young and older residents can meet and strengthen ties.” Indeed, such communities are part of a larger conversation we seem to be having in this country about the need for more communal support to raise all children. Last year, David Brooks penned an article for The Atlantic arguing that the nuclear family had failed us. He bemoaned the loss of extended families and tightly-connected neighborhoods, suggesting that “forged families” are the future, people who may not be related by blood, but have chosen to live in community. A New Yorker article on communal living among adults focuses on arrangements like Treehouse Hollywood, which author Nathan Heller describes as “a space for community living, where people of many ages and from many walks of life eat together, spend time together, and conduct their lives largely in common view.” At least one young single mother who was interviewed says she found support for her child rearing with the other adults there. As Brooks writes: “Americans are hungering to live in extended and forged families, in ways that are new and ancient at the same time. This is a significant opportunity, a chance to thicken and broaden family relationships, a chance to allow more adults and children to live and grow under the loving gaze of a dozen pairs of eyes, and be caught, when they fall, by a dozen pairs of arms.” There are certainly a dozen arms waiting to catch the kids at Peppers Ranch, but they are primarily being cared for by nuclear families. Each couple makes decisions about bringing children into their family — each contracts with the state of Oklahoma separately to care for these kids. They have different rules for their children make different decisions about where to send their children to school and how much to involve themselves with other families in the community. They take different vacations and attend different camps. Each couple is guided by their own faith and attend a variety of churches. These children have often come from environments where there were a dozen pairs of arms — parents, grandmothers, aunts, neighbors — but none of them were responsible or capable enough to be the children’s primary caretakers, which is how they ended up in foster care in the first place. Peppers Ranch is built on a different notion — that children need two parents, including in most cases one who works and one who is at home, and the presence of their biological siblings if possible. These family units can certainly stand to benefit from the support of others in the community — the grandmothers, the other fathers and mothers in the same position, the counselors and therapists and learning specialists — but the family is the thing. Naomi Schaefer Riley is a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a Deseret News contributor and the author of “No Way to Treat a Child: How the Foster Care System, Family Courts, and Racial Activists Are Wrecking Young Lives.”",2021-10-25 04:24:04,"Desie’s eyes grow wide as she looks over the menu at Cattlemen’s Steakhouse, a popular destination with tourists, local families and even cowboys in the Stockyards area outside of Oklahoma City. The 8-year-old Desie does not get to go out for dinner often — the nine other children in her family make that logistically and financially challenging — but that does not stop this soon-to-be third grader from sharing her adventurous tastes. “I’m going to start with the shrimp cocktail,” she announces to the half of our group of 14 sitting at one table. Desie came to stay with Ashlee and Matt Terry when she was 8 days old. It was part of a “Home for the Holidays” emergency placement. Desie came to the Terrys right after Thanksgiving in 2012 while child welfare services figured out what to do with her; she never left. Desie was actually the fourth child placed with the Terrys. Their first placements were in 2011 — sisters Evie and Piper — and then their biological sister Bella a few months later. In 2014, with four daughters, three bedrooms and only one shower, they decided they did not have the space for more. Ashlee recalls: “I said that when God provided more bathrooms, we would reopen our home.” God seemed to answer their prayer when they were offered a spot at Peppers Ranch, a community in Guthrie, about 30 minutes from Oklahoma City. The ranch harnesses an old-fashioned understanding of family, neighborhood and community to solve the problems of a new generation of displaced children. Opened in 2002, with the donation of 160 acres of land, Peppers Ranch was originally a residential facility for abused and neglected boys. The donor, Hal French, a local oil and gas entrepreneur, had grown up near a boys home and often played with the children there, and wanted to create a similar opportunity for more kids. After a few years, things seemed to be going OK for the boys who came to Peppers Ranch. But their sisters were just being dropped off at a local shelter. The girls had no equivalent and, more importantly, the siblings were losing their connection to one another. Which got French and the other folks at Peppers Ranch to thinking. According to research from Casey Family Programs, “approximately two-thirds of children in foster care have a sibling in care, and yet — despite the benefits of joint sibling placements — it is estimated that more than 70% of children with siblings are separated from one or more of their siblings while in care.” Benefits of placing siblings together include lower incidence of behavioral problems and a higher chance they will both like and adapt to their foster homes and have better academic performance. Related She outgrew foster care, but the hardship didn’t stop there But finding foster or adoptive families that have the capacity to take in sibling groups is hard. Even if parents have an extra bed in their home or are willing to take in two siblings, what are the chances they have the space (let alone the time and energy) to take in three or four? The result is that sibling groups are either separated or tend to languish in foster care for longer. And so Peppers Ranch tried something different. In 2009, after extensive studies, the leadership decided to move to a family model, offering couples who were already licensed to do foster care in Oklahoma the opportunity to move to Peppers Ranch. There they could live in one of the newly built houses, paying only a couple of hundred dollars in rent and receiving a small stipend in addition to what the state offered for foster care, if they were willing to open their home to at least five foster children. Today, there are 16 homes on the property (with plans to build a few more over the next few years), all more than 3,000 square feet. The typical home has four bedrooms, a large living area and an industrial-size kitchen and pantry. The more recent homes even have hookups for two washers and dryers as well as larger garages in which families can park their super-size vans. The entire community has an annual budget of about $1.5 million, all from private donations. In addition to money, locals also donate furniture, clothing and other necessities. Hundreds of volunteers help maintain the grounds and run programs for the kids. One of the homes Peppers Ranch provides to its foster families. Spark Creative Set amid farmlands at the end of a dirt road which is prone to flooding, the community may seem inconvenient to some, but for the families at Peppers Ranch, it offers everything they need. The landscape feels a little sparse — not enough time has passed for many trees to mature on the land. Each family has a backyard, equipped with all the trampolines and play structures you would find in a typical suburban neighborhood. There is also a community basketball court and soccer field, a playground and pool complex, a pond where the kids can fish, and a barn with 17 horses. The horses, many of which are older and have been donated in their retirement, are used for equestrian therapy. They are gentle and the kids enjoy helping to care for them. Indeed, one of the Peppers Ranch mothers told me how excited her 6-year-old adoptive son was when he was given his very own pooper scooper for the horses. “They need my help,” he would tell his mother before running over to the barn. Each family also has to help with chores around the community — including feeding the horses over a weekend when the trainer is not around. The logistics of being a foster parent, especially with multiple children in the home, can be overwhelming. Multiple therapy appointments a week, in addition to arranging visitation with biological parents, meetings with social workers and court dates can make even the most organized person’s head spin. But Peppers Ranch brings at least some of those services to the community. There is a learning center where children can receive after-school tutoring. The ranch also offers art therapy, dance therapy, a swim team and a variety of other extracurricular activities. Parents pay a small fee for these out of the stipends they receive. The community requires at least one parent to work full time. But the subsidized housing at Peppers Ranch means one parent can stay home full time — and most of the time they do. With so many kids, especially ones who have behavioral and emotional challenges, it is hard to outsource child care. But the state stipends do not allow a typical middle-class foster family to give up one income. In families with older kids, mothers sometimes have part-time jobs they can do from home during school hours. Mostly it’s the mothers at home but in at least one case it’s the father who cares for the children while the mother works as a hospital nurse. Whoever stays home, the arrangement is a relief for parents. Dustin Burpo, a family pastor at a nearby church and a parent at Peppers Ranch, tells me that he and his wife recently looked at their budget. “We’ve got a house to stay in, a nice house that has plenty of space for our large capacity living” — the Burpos have eight children — “It truly gives you that peace of mind. It’s a weight off my shoulders, knowing that I’ve got a place for my kids.” But it’s not just the homes. It’s the community. Most of the families give their kids freedom to roam. Matt Terry says that’s one of the things he likes about Peppers Ranch, that it feels like a more old-fashioned neighborhood. It’s certainly true that it’s small enough for everyone to know everyone else. Shelly Blankenship, who has been at Peppers Ranch since 2011 and fostered around 80 children here, compares it to when she grew up across the street from her grandmother and down the street from her aunt. “You couldn’t get away with anything.” When she sees kids misbehaving at Peppers Ranch, she will say, “I don’t think you need to be doing that.” They will ask if she is going to tell their mother. Her response? “Do I need to tell her? If you’re going to quit and act right, then I don’t have to tell her anything. We’ve already taken care of it.” Even if they lived in such a neighborhood today, though, parents of foster children and children adopted out of foster care often have a much more difficult calculation about giving their children freedom. Should you let a kid wander around a neighborhood knowing that they have been traumatized by other adults? Are there psychological and behavioral problems that could pop up if something scares them or surprises them? How will other adults respond? Will their fellow parents blame them if something goes wrong? Related Opinion: Religious foster care plays a vital role for our most vulnerable children And this is really the genius of Peppers Ranch. It is a supportive community filled with other children who have gone through similar things and other adults who are trying to help those children. While many of the families at Peppers Ranch have found some level of support for their foster care efforts among friends and family, they often felt isolated before they came here. “You have behaviors for a child and you think that something is wrong with me as a parent,” says Kristin Burpo, Dustin’s wife. “You just feel judged, even in a church community,” she tells me. At Peppers Ranch, veteran parents often serve as mentors to the newer ones. The mothers meet at least once a month to talk about the issues that they are facing with their children, where to find resources to help, how to deal with the emotional toll that fostering is taking on them, their marriages, and even their other children. Most research shows that about half of all foster parents quit within their first year. Kristin Martinez understands why. Martinez, who has one biological child and seven adopted children, remembers the day she took in a 16-year-old girl. “I never had a teenager before. I could immediately go to other neighbors and they were able to provide me with great information and great resources.” Her children are playing in the backyard when I arrive, but then come in and sit down with us, periodically asking when it will be time to go get snow cones. She also describes the other trials of being a foster parent, including the “heartbreak” of having a child leave after a long time to go back to their biological family. She asks me to imagine having a child live with you for a year or more, having him or her become part of your children’s lives and then never seeing them again. Or what about “when you’re going through the heartbreak of going to all the court dates”? Martinez recalls “the heartbreak of the biological parents never getting it together. Witnessing the heartbreak that happens to your child. It’s a very emotional roller coaster, this life.” A couple of her older kids nod in agreement. She finds it reassuring that “there’s somebody here to understand that. When you’re having a really hard day and you’re in tears because it’s so hard,” she says, it means so much to her “to have people that literally understand exactly what you’re going through. … To have people that you can do this life with is pretty special.” There is also a network of support for children who live at Peppers Ranch and did not come from foster care. Few people can understand the journey of biological children whose parents keep bringing new children into the home. As Shelly Blankenship acknowledges, “My kids weren’t from trauma, but I put trauma in their lives.” But being at Peppers Ranch has helped her children process that. Rather than putting all this emotional chaos behind her, her daughter, who is now 25, has guardianship over a 17-year-old in the system. Kristin Burpo appreciates that her children see “unconditional love” in her home and in the other homes at Peppers Ranch. “This is always my prayer, that they would see my heart in all of it. And no matter the child that comes in my home, they’re my child when they’re in my home.” The Burpo family enjoys some time on the beach. Memory McElhaney During COVID-19, the community created its own bubble. The kids would still play with each other, going on field trips to state parks some days. The moms would get together, pick up some food and sit in one of their vans to get a break from the kids. “We did that once a week just to try to keep our sanity,” Kristin recalls. The Burpos had two biological children when they took in Shanaya, their first foster child from a family that her husband’s brother (a pastor) knew from his church. Even in a community that was welcoming, she worried that their children might stick out. “Our daughter is black and we are white. It was a little bit awkward” in the small town they lived in before Peppers Ranch. “Coming out here, we know that Shanaya would grow up not feeling odd. Coming to a community where everybody was accepted the way they were because it was just normal. … That was really big for us.” Since moving to Peppers Ranch, they have adopted two sets of siblings: Shakota, 8, Sky, 7, and Trinity, 6; and JC, 4, and Keisha, 3. When I visit their house the chaos is controlled. Kristin is folding laundry. The older kids have helped the younger kids get their sandwiches for lunch and they are passing around the largest container of cheese balls I have ever seen. Three of the younger kids go to watch cartoons when they are done. The family has just come back from a vacation Bible school camp and they are trying to get back into a routine. Dustin, their father, is a pastor at a church about 40 minutes away. Peppers Ranch is not a faith-based organization but every one of the families there is guided in some way by their religious beliefs. Ashley Hahn, the director of the ranch, says they have all “felt called through faith to this walk.” She tells me, “I’m a person of faith. I don’t know how you could do it without knowing the Lord is on your side.” Most of the Burpo kids ignore me, but one of the girls takes me on a grand tour of the house, showing me what’s inside of each of the closets, introducing me to the cat. She seems to crave attention in a way that would be typical for an outgoing 7-year-old. And she clearly enjoys showing off for guests. But then she starts taking watermelon rinds out of the garbage and chewing on them. When Dustin notices, he is calm but firm, asking her to stop. After she does it again, he takes her aside, offering a sterner but still completely calm warning. The kids, as Kristin explains to me over the third basket of laundry, have all manner of diagnoses. A number were born with drugs in their systems. Others watched their parents physically abuse each other and experienced severe neglect as they were shuttled back and forth among parents too strung out to care for them and grandparents who were overwhelmed. Providing a stable environment with love and clear boundaries is important, but the Burpos have tried to consider in other ways how they parent. Almost everyone at Peppers Ranch has been through training in how to deal with kids who have experienced trauma. Dustin also says he talks to other fathers at the ranch about their unique role. Many of the kids have no responsible adult male in their lives. “We are fathers to the fatherless.” Dustin, who counts himself lucky for growing up with a father and a stepfather, says he fears for these kids, many of whom “don’t know who their biological father is and they probably never will know. I get to fill that role. And it’s very humbling and scary at the same time.” Peppers Ranch families think about the building blocks of a normal family and how to re-create them for kids who have come out of dysfunctional homes. Kristin has seen up close how vital it is for sibling groups to stay together. It’s difficult for younger kids because they want to have at least one of the older people they look up to present in their lives. But “when it’s an older child taking care of a younger child and then they are split, … the older child was the caretaker and then they have no purpose.” Ashlee and Matt met doing a training offered by the Oklahoma Department of Health Services. She was training to be a caseworker, helping foster children find permanency. He was training to be a child abuse investigator. It wasn’t long before they were married and began taking in foster children themselves. Matt says that Ashlee is the one in charge of all the logistics of the family and making sure everything works, but it’s clear that his experience working with this population of children has driven him here as well. In his first few months on the job, he discovered three dead children. It was during the rise of meth labs in the area a few years ago. “We didn’t know what we were stepping into.” At dinner with the Terry family at Cattlemen’s, the dynamics of the siblings seems both happy and familiar.

Most nonreligious Americans are vaccinated. But how do we reach the holdouts?,https://www.deseret.com/faith/2021/10/24/22726287/how-to-reach-the-secular-americans-who-refuse-to-get-vaccinated-pew-research-prri-covid-vaccine,,['Mya Jaradat'],,,"Illustration by Alex Cochran While those unaffiliated with a religion have a high vaccination rate, there are secular holdouts who remain hesitant or are refusers. With no centralized place to reach them, how do we help them get vaccinated? Recently, in my social circles, I’ve come across something I thought unusual: secular Americans who refuse to get vaccinated. Like many Americans, I assumed the religiously unaffiliated to be more progressive. Statistically, the less religious tend to lean left and left-leaning Americans are more likely to be vaccinated. But these unaffiliated, unvaccinated women and man defied neat categories. They offered a variety of reasons for not getting the shot, ranging from “It’s a personal decision” to “I refuse to bow to COVID.” Shane Dunlap, Pittsburgh Tribune-Review via Associated Press Are these the last — and hardest to reach — holdouts when it comes to getting the country vaccinated? According to both the Public Religion Research Institute and Pew Research Center, 75% of religiously unaffiliated Americans — who are also known as “nones” — are vaccinated. But Pew broke the data down a bit more: According to Pew, 90% of atheists are vaccinated as are 85% of agnostics. Those who described themselves as “nothing in particular” are only 69% vaccinated. The only religious group less vaccinated are white evangelicals. “The assumption about nones that they’re all a super liberal group is not necessarily accurate,” Natalie Jackson, director of research at Public Religion Research Institute, said. “It’s like any other group we put together to talk about it but they’re not a monolith.” While they are, on the whole, “more liberal than their religious counterparts on many many measures,” Jackson said, “there are some people, certainly, who are kind of formerly evangelicals or formerly conservative Christian and they’re still conservative but they’ve just kind of lopped off the Christian.” Jackson added that 14% of the religiously unaffiliated are Republicans, a group that has lower vaccination rates than Democrats. Mandate to engage While a survey conducted by Public Religion Research Institute and the Interfaith Youth Core showed that 18% of the religiously unaffiliated would be somewhat receptive to religious outreach regarding the COVID-19 vaccine, what about the other 82%? What’s the best way to get them on the vaccine train? Science, data or logic won’t be as effective, experts said, as interpersonal relationships and trust would be. That “sort of mandates” Americans to engage in personal, individualized conversations addressing these people’s concerns and feelings, Jackson said. Jackson remarked that we’re past the point where blanket statements about public health will work. Rather, ”If you’re going for persuasion it’s going to be an individual conversation that has to happen,” she said. “These are conversations that Joe Biden or (Dr. Anthony) Fauci can’t have,” said Nick Fish, president of the American Atheists organization. Such “last mile conversations are much harder and we have to get over our own unease about being willing to engage in these conversations.” Fish said it’s crucial to “meet people where they’re at.” Atheists often make the mistake of hitting other people over the head with data and science, Fish admitted. But to reach the last vaccine hesitant and refusers, we need to listen with an open heart and compassion. “The question of the individual rights thing ... is really challenging because it can come across as a value judgment,” said Fish, whose father leans conservative and was initially hesitant to get the vaccine. “But one of the ways to get at that is, ‘Yes, I agree it’s a personal choice. For you, personally, what is stopping you?’” Establishing trust Listening plays an important role in building trust and tailoring counterarguments to the individual’s concerns. “If you’re talking about individual rights, individual liberty, individual choice, you’re talking about moving through the world without fear and this is a way to do it — by taking this shot,” Fish said. “We don’t have to continue these lockdowns or these impositions on your liberty — (the vaccine) is a way out of it.” As for secular people who “don’t want to bow to COVID,” Fish said that pointing out that the vaccine is a way to beat the virus, not bow to it, could be effective. If all else fails, you can always turn to the good old fashioned guilt trip, Fish joked. That’s what worked with his father. Around the time of Fish’s birthday, Fish told his parents he wanted his father to get vaccinated so he could go visit them. It worked and his dad got the jab. But the data suggests that, when it comes to the secular hesitant or refusers, appeals from friends and family members will only go so far. Among the unaffiliated, Jackson said, “We do get 30% of them saying that a health care provider could encourage them. Friends or family is 15%.” “I think, in general, what we see with everybody is also true with unaffiliated folks. It’s about establishing trust and being that trusted messenger or providing information and listening to what their individual issues are,” Jackson reflected. “At some point every additional person who gets vaccinated requires an individual touch.” Bigger problems to solve Another aspect of meeting people where they are, experts said, is making sure they have easy access to vaccines. Fish and other experts pointed out that some of the Americans who remain unvaccinated might be doing so not by choice, but due to other obstacles that impede their access to vaccines. “We do need to reduce barriers still,” Fish said, pointing to the lack of availability of vaccines in rural areas as one example. Other impediments to getting vaccinated include an inability to take the time off of work to get the shot or to take sick days if one becomes ill in reaction to the vaccine. A lack of transportation or child care also poses obstacles. These issues point to deeper problems to be resolved, said Nicole Carr, deputy director of the American Humanist Association, such as “the importance of things like all employers being required to offer paid sick leave and reasonable time off — that make for a more equitable society, in general.”",2021-10-25 04:00:01,"Recently, in my social circles, I’ve come across something I thought unusual: secular Americans who refuse to get vaccinated.

Trudeau has long sought a trade deal with the 10-nation bloc, which includes the Philippines, Indonesia, Brunei, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Burma. He told a virtual business summit organized by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations that a free trade agreement with Canada would be a “win-win” for all sides, particularly coming out of the pandemic. Speaking in a pre-recorded message, Trudeau argued that an agreement with ASEAN would help companies and entrepreneurs build connections and business relationships around the world. He also said a pact would give investors more confidence to invest in international markets, and protect supply chains from the uncertainties brought by COVID-19. Trade bottlenecks across the globe have been slower to recover than consumer demand for goods, and slowed further by ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks and public health measures. All this affects inventories of in-demand consumer products or the delivery of parts needed to build things like cars, and pushes up transportation costs that get passed on to consumers, which is reflected in higher inflation rates. “As we finish the fight against COVID-19, deepening our ties with ASEAN economies and diversifying trade across the Asia-Pacific will play a crucial role in our recovery,” Trudeau said in his address. “My friends, a strong Canada-ASEAN relationship is a clear win-win for all of our businesses and all of our people.” The economies of the 10-nation bloc as a group represent Canada’s sixth largest trading partner, but the country already has access to four ASEAN members — Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam — through a Pacific Rim trade pact known as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). The Liberals’ election platform promised a new hub to help businesses take advantage of opportunities under CPTPP, and a new Asia-Pacific strategy aimed at deepening ties in the region, including new trade deals. A preliminary analysis by ASEAN and the federal government on the merits of a free trade deal estimated Canadian exports of goods and services to the bloc could go up by 13.3 per cent, valued at US$2.67 billion In his address, Trudeau said both sides must also ensure women, Indigenous people, LGBTQ entrepreneurs, visible minorities and other under-represented business owners get involved in and benefit from trade.

SINGAPORE, Oct 25 — The Truth Warriors website has been issued a correction direction for publishing materials that promote the efficacy of ivermectin in treating Covid-19 and cast doubt on the effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines. The website is required to publish the correction notice at the top of each webpage containing the falsehoods, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a statement on Saturday (Oct 25). The Minister for Health has instructed the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) Office to issue the notice, added MOH. “Many of the materials published on the Truth Warriors website mislead people into thinking that Covid-19 vaccines are not effective in reducing transmission rates of Covid-19, and promote the safety and efficacy of ivermectin in preventing viral infections and treating Covid-19,” said MOH. These materials are from “unverified and dubious sources” and individuals who heed the advice of the website can endanger themselves and the people around them, said the ministry. It added that the Government takes a serious view of the deliberate communication of these falsehoods and criminal investigations will be conducted.MOH said the following were falsehoods on the Truth Warriors website: The most vaccinated countries have the most cases and deaths per million population and the least vaccinated countries have the fewest cases and deaths per million population Vaccines do not prevent the transmission of Covid-19.MOH said that all these claims were false and that as of Oct 23, the weight of international evidence shows categorically that vaccines reduce Covid-19 infection, as well as serious illness and mortality rates. “The latest data does not support the claim that countries with the highest vaccination rates also have the highest cases/deaths per million population. While some countries with the lowest vaccination rates also have low reported Covid-19 deaths, this is likely due to poor record collection for both vaccinations and deaths,” it said. It added that while vaccines do not completely stop viral transmission, vaccines do reduce the risk of transmission as vaccinated persons are less likely to transmit the virus than unvaccinated persons. “Furthermore, while the vaccine on its own does not kill the virus, it is false to suggest that the effect of the vaccine on the immune system does not lead to the killing of the virus. The vaccines cause the body to produce antibodies and immune cells that act against the virus and, in effect, kill it,” explained MOH. As for the website’s claims that ivermectin prevents Covid-19 infection, and that it is safe and effective in treating Covid-19, even for pregnant women, MOH said that self-medicating with it can be dangerous. Ivermectin, it said, is a prescription-only medicine registered in Singapore specifically for the treatment of parasitic worm infections and not an anti-viral medicine. Side-effects include vomiting, diarrhoea, stomach pain, neurologic adverse events (dizziness, seizures, confusion), sudden drop in blood pressure, severe skin rash potentially requiring hospitalisation, and liver injury (hepatitis). Ivermectin can also interact with other medications used, such as blood thinners, it said. MOH added that the website also shares user-collated and unverified data on suspected vaccine injuries in Singapore, citing the “SG Suspected Vaccine Injuries” Telegram chat as its source. “We advise members of the public not to speculate and/or spread misinformation which may cause public alarm, and to refer to credible sources of information instead,” it said. MOH urged the public to visit www.moh.gov.sg and www.hsa.gov.sg for the latest information on Covid-19 and Covid-19 vaccinations. — TODAY",2021-10-25 00:37:12,,,malaymail,True,"[('the Ministry of Health', 'ORG'), ('Saturday', 'DATE'), ('Instagram', 'ORG'), ('Telegram', 'ORG'), ('SINGAPORE', 'GPE'), ('Oct 25', 'DATE'), ('The Truth Warriors', 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('the Ministry of Health', 'ORG'), ('Saturday', 'DATE'), ('Oct 25', 'DATE'), ('the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act', 'ORG'), ('POFMA) Office', 'ORG'), ('Government', 'ORG'), ('MOH', 'ORG'), ('million', 'CARDINAL'), ('Vaccines', 'PERSON'), ('Covid-19.MOH', 'ORG'), ('Oct 23', 'DATE'), ('MOH', 'ORG'), ('ivermectin', 'NORP'), ('MOH', 'ORG'), ('Ivermectin', 'PERSON'), ('Singapore', 'GPE'), ('Ivermectin', 'PERSON'), ('MOH', 'ORG'), ('Singapore', 'GPE'), ('SG Suspected Vaccine Injuries', 'WORK_OF_ART')]"

You want them to go into the comfort of their own pediatrician’s office.”He said the vaccine, developed with BioNTec SE, will be packaged for doctors’ offices.U.S. Kids Set for Shots by Early November (11:30 a.m. NY)Two top U.S. health officials signaled confidence that children ages 5 to 11 will begin getting Covid-19 vaccines by early November. “If all goes well, and we get the regulatory approval ... it’s entirely possible if not very likely that vaccines will be available for children from five to 11 within the first week or two of November,” Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, said on ABC’s “This Week.”His comments were echoed by Rochelle Walensky, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which must ultimately approve the shots. “There will be vaccine out there so children can start rolling up their sleeves,” Walensky said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”Health experts say vaccinating children will be a key step in helping end the U.S. outbreak, though a Kaiser Family Foundation study found in September that only about a third of parents would vaccinate their children immediately. Almost 65 million eligible Americans ages 12 and older are not vaccinated. Advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will meet Tuesday to consider data for children’s use of the vaccine by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE. Approval by the FDA and the CDC is also required.Sunak Plays Down New U.K. Curbs (6:18 a.m. NY)U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak told the BBC that available Covid-19 data don’t support a move to harsher restrictions. Speaking against a backdrop of rising virus cases and ahead of his budget this week, Sunak said a return to the furlough program that saw the government pay as much as 80% of the wages of idled workers was not on the cards. “We don’t envisage having to impose significant economic restrictions in the way that we had to over the last year.”Malaysia Sees Further Drop in Cases (4:49 p.m. HK)Malaysia recorded the fewest cases since the end of June. The Southeast Asian country added 5,666 new infections Sunday, bringing the total number of cases to more than 2.43 million, according to a tweet by Health Malaysia Director-General Noor Hisham Abdullah. Meanwhile, almost 95% of Malaysia’s adult population have received a complete dose of vaccines, according to the health ministry’s data.Russia Deaths, Cases Remain Near Record (4:17 p.m. HK)Russian coronavirus cases and deaths remained near record levels on Sunday ahead of the implementation of strict nationwide curbs to stem a surge in infections.There were 35,660 new cases and 1,072 deaths over the past day, slightly below records set Saturday, according to data from the national coronavirus headquarters. Last week, President Vladimir Putin ordered nationwide non-working days for the first week of November to slow the spread, while Moscow will be closed for most business from Oct. 28 through Nov. 7.China Expects Outbreak to Widen (4:08 p.m. HK)China’s new Covid-19 infections will increase in coming days and the areas affected by the pandemic may continue to expand.The current outbreak in China is caused by the delta variant, Wu Liangyou, an official at the National Health Commission, said at a briefing in Beijing on Sunday. The outbreak has expanded to 11 provinces in the week since Oct. 17, Mi Feng, a spokesman for the commission, said at the same briefing.Earlier on Sunday, Beijing authorities announced the city is halting cross-province tourism and closing card and majhong rooms. China’s capital will also cut the number of large events and increase supervision over small clinics and pharmacies, according to the official WeChat account of the Beijing Municipal Health Commission.Belgium to Weigh Stricter Rules (3:21 p.m. HK)Belgian Prime Minister Alexander de Croo will meet with his cabinet Monday to discuss the virus situation and consider tighter curbs. The government is mulling a return to stricter mask rules, Belga reports, citing a government spokesman. Belgium, like other European countries, is seeing rising infections, with more than 8.5 million of a population of about 11.5 million being fully vaccinated. ©2021 Bloomberg L.P.With assistance from Bloomberg.

COVID doesn't need to run rampant. Here are 6 ways to keep cases low in the next year,https://theconversation.com/covid-doesnt-need-to-run-rampant-here-are-6-ways-to-keep-cases-low-in-the-next-year-170207,,"['Brendan Crabb', ' Director and CEO', ' Burnet Institute']",,,"In the blink of an eye, we’ve gone from 18 months of zero tolerance for COVID to accepting huge case numbers as the norm for Australia’s foreseeable future. Our ambitions are now limited to simply keeping a lid on things to avoid our health systems being overwhelmed – not that we’ve defined what that limit is. But how many lives, severe illnesses, and cases of long COVID are we willing to accept? The national and other roadmaps aren’t explicit about this. NSW and Victoria have regularly seen 10-15 lives lost each day to COVID, so this could represent the baseline rather than the cap. The impact of long COVID simply isn’t considered in the risk-benefit equation. It’s time to draw breath and consider a better alternative. High case numbers aren’t our only path to freedom. It’s not inevitable all Australians will get COVID in the near future. We could keep numbers low now and move to a strategy of eliminating the virus, like we do for measles, mumps, rubella and whooping cough, just to name a few. A strategy of local COVID elimination shouldn’t be taboo when it’s the norm for many other infectious diseases. Why do high case numbers matter if we’re all vaccinated? COVID vaccines are truly brilliant, especially against severe disease. They provide the essential base to move away from harsh public health measures. But like any medical intervention, they’re not perfect, even against severe illness. You aren’t bulletproof if you’ve had two doses. In fact, as Health Minister Greg Hunt announced last week, you’ll probably need a third dose soon. What’s more, releasing restrictions across the country is based on vaccination targets for those over 16 years. But reaching 70% and 80% targets leaves 30% or 20% of people unvaccinated and at risk in this group alone. Importantly this will include pockets of communities with much lower vaccination levels than others. Plus all children under 12 will be unvaccinated. Together, that’s 5-10 million unvaccinated Australians. Let’s be clear, the virus is and will be in our community for some time. This is sometimes inaccurately described as “endemic”, as in, a settled and predictable infection. COVID isn’t that yet, and we have no idea when it will be. COVID will remain epidemic for some time, characterised by bursts in at-risk communities and pockets of under-vaccinated people, because of waning immunity or new variants. If not countered, this epidemic scenario will continue to disrupt our health and economy. So, we need a ‘vaccines-plus’ strategy Keeping COVID numbers low presents a substantial challenge, especially in deeply fatigued NSW and Victoria. But as OzSAGE, an Australian network of scientists providing advice on COVID, has detailed, it can be achieved with a deliberate “vaccines-plus” strategy. The “plus” includes a range of minimally disruptive measures to keep transmission down, such as improving ventilation and maintaining the use of masks in higher risk settings. Victoria’s schools’ package is the best current example of appropriate ambition in this space. International examples tell us vaccines-plus works vastly better than vaccine-only. Keeping numbers low also presents a positive-feedback loop as it enables a functioning test, trace, isolate and quarantine system that’s crucial to keeping a lid on numbers. Keeping numbers low now doesn’t just delay the inevitable. In fact, a major motivation for holding the line is the future will be much better. Six ways to strengthen our COVID defences In 12 months’ time, the tools for interrupting transmission and managing COVID as a sporadic infectious disease will be substantially stronger than they are now. A realistic vision for a year from now includes: 1. Vastly improved vaccination Three shots will be routine and 80-90% of the whole population will be fully vaccinated in this way. Kids over five will also immunised, and we’ll be on the way to approving vaccines for those under five. This goal is likely to be achieved in six months rather than 12. We’ll be able to identify people who need further boosters using “immunity tests”, which provide a surrogate measure of people’s immunity. These are being developed by the Burnet and Doherty Institutes. Vaccines will prevent much more transmission than they do now. 2. Much less airborne transmission Clean air will be provided in risky indoor settings in a regulated and accepted way. Indoor density limits, and improved, targeted mask-wearing will be normalised in settings like public transport and schools. 3. New treatments Advances in therapy are likely to change the game completely. These could be simple pills or inhalers. For example, Australia recently purchased Merck’s COVID pill “molnupiravir”, which the company said halved the risk of hospitalisation and death. This is just a taster of what’s to come. Read more: Take-at-home COVID drug molnupiravir may be on its way — but vaccination is still our first line of defence 4. Improved test, trace, isolate and quarantine People who have COVID will easily and quickly know they’re positive and stay home while infectious. Our test, trace, isolate and quarantine systems will be functional and modernised, perhaps even using artificial intelligence. Self-testing, at home and elsewhere, will be widespread. 5. Traffic light quarantine system Borders will be open but risk-assessed. High-risk travellers will still have some form of quarantine. This is especially important to keep new variants at bay. 6. Reduced COVID in the region It’s really not an option for the developed world to let infections run free in low-income countries. COVID doesn’t need to run rampant Letting COVID run is a risky experiment and most countries with greater experience of the impact of COVID infections have rejected this approach. An ambitious attitude to elimination can be achieved with a vaccines-plus strategy now and embracing innovations as they inevitably come. The second-best pandemic outcome is for most Australians to be fully vaccinated before they encounter the virus for the first time. After 18 months of monumental effort, and to this country’s enduring credit, this objective will be achieved. But there’s an even more important end goal for our health, free society, and economy – for most Australians to never encounter the virus at all, or if they do, to not be infected by it. In 12 months’ time, our defence against COVID will be stronger. We need a vaccines-plus strategy to safely get us there.

However, biotech stocks can rebound quickly after bad news. Should growth-oriented investors consider buying these beaten-down biotech stocks next week? Let's take a deeper dive to find out. Image source: Getty Images. Atea Pharmaceuticals: Has max pain been reached? Atea's shares crumbled last week after its Roche -partnered direct-acting antiviral pill, AT-527, flopped in a phase 2 trial for patients with mild or moderate cases of COVID-19. The back story is that AT-527 was on track to possibly become a megablockbuster orally administered treatment for COVID-19. That investing thesis isn't completely off the table, as the drug is still making its way through a pivotal trial. Moreover, Atea and Roche are reportedly adding more high-risk COVID-19 patients with underlying health conditions to this ongoing phase 3 trial, which ought to boost the drug's chances of success. But that all-important data readout is now expected to be delayed by up to six months. Can Atea's shares rebound? I think there's a reasonable chance that this small-cap biotech could indeed rebound in the weeks and months to come. The failed phase 2 trial for AT-527 contained both vaccinated patients and patients with milder forms of the disease. What's more, the drug did reportedly show a clinical benefit in higher-risk patients. The bad news is that Atea and Roche's oral COVID-19 pill would probably be the third one on the market if this phase 3 trial hits its primary endpoint. So while the megablockbuster sales thesis is probably out the window, AT-527 could still post some impressive sales at the end of the day. In short, Atea's stock will undoubtedly require investor patience, but it does come across as an intriguing rebound candidate. Agenus: A regulatory miscue Agenus, a small-cap cancer specialist, lost almost a quarter of its value last week. Shareholders hit the exits on this stock last week after the company announced that it had withdrawn the Biologics License Application (BLA) for the second-line cervical cancer drug known as balstilimab. The company did so in response to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s granting a full approval for Merck 's rival therapy, Keytruda, for this indication. Agenus also announced that it will discontinue the drug's ongoing confirmatory trial in this patient population, which ought to slash the company's research and development expenses by a healthy $100 million. Where do things stand now? My take is that investors overreacted to this news. Balstilimab's monotherapy indication as a treatment for advanced cervical cancer was never going to be a big moneymaker for the company. Agenus even admitted as much in its press release last week. By contrast, Agenus' next-generation checkpoint inhibitor therapies , and partnerships with the likes of Bristol Myers Squibb , Gilead Sciences , among others, will ultimately be the biotech's core value drivers. In fact, I think this tiny cancer company will have one of its partners buy it out within the next 12 months. The emerging trend in biopharma is to acquire promising cancer assets early in their developmental process, and Agenus has an expansive pipeline chock-full of those types of therapies. Novavax: Can this vaccine company deliver? Shares of vaccine developer Novavax plunged by almost 17% last week, following a Politico article claiming that the biotech's COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing process may not be up to regulators' quality standards. The big deal is that the article's anonymous sources reported that the company could take until the end of 2022 to resolve these manufacturing issues and win regulatory authorizations for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate. By then, the pandemic may be winding down, thereby lowering the demand for additional vaccines. So, in a worst-case scenario, Novavax's experimental COVID-19 vaccine may badly miss Wall Street's sky-high revenue projections in the coming years. Can Novavax adapt and overcome? The company has repeatedly missed its own regulatory submission deadlines for the vaccine this year, and it has no experience at scaling up its manufacturing process to bring a product to market. That's the bad news. The good news is that the company's management did note in a reponse to this article that it remains confident in its ability to produce high-quality vaccines at scale. If true, Novavax's stock should rebound nicely from this hefty downturn. The biotech's stock, after all, is currently trading at less than 2 times 2022 projected revenue -- which is dirt cheap for a biotech stock. Ocular Therapeutix: A key clinical setback Ocular Therapeutix saw its shares crater by 38% last week in response to a failed phase 2 trial for the dry-eye treatment OTX-CSI, a hydrogel insert containing the immunosuppressant medication cyclosporine. The biopharma and its shareholders had hoped that this experimental treatment would be a healthy revenue generator for the company in the years ahead. Those hopes, however, were dashed when the drug failed to boost tear production in this midstage trial. Can Ocular's stock recover this lost ground? I think there's a strong probability that this beaten-down biotech will recover, and perhaps quickly. The biotech has multiple upcoming clinical catalysts in the high-value areas of episodic dry-eye disease, glaucoma, and wet age-related macular degeneration. What's more, Ocular does have its FDA-approved eye inflammation drug, Dextenza, to fall back on. This single product is forecast to rake in over $250 million in peak sales, which is a fairly healthy revenue stream for a company with a $529 million market cap at present. Ocular's shares, therefore, might turn out to be a downright bargain after last week's massive sell-off.",,fool,True,"[('Biotech', 'ORG'), ('COVID-19', 'ORG'), ('this year', 'DATE'), ('12%', 'PERCENT'), ('2021', 'DATE'), ('Shiba Inu', 'ORG'), ('Tesla', 'PERSON'), ('NASDAQ', 'ORG'), ('Digital World Acquisition', 'ORG'), ('NASDAQ', 'ORG'), ('Shiba Inu', 'ORG'), ('just the past 14 months', 'DATE'), ('Tesla', 'ORG'), ('over 1,600%', 'PERCENT'), ('the past three years', 'DATE'), ('Donald Trump', 'PERSON'), ('Digital World Acquisition', 'ORG'), ('the past week', 'DATE'), ('this year', 'DATE'), ('Atea Pharmaceuticals', 'ORG'), ('NASDAQ', 'ORG'), ('AVIR', 'ORG'), ('Novavax', 'PERSON'), ('NASDAQ', 'ORG'), ('NVAX', 'ORG'), ('Ocular Therapeutix', 'PERSON'), ('OCUL', 'ORG'), ('last week', 'DATE'), ('next week', 'DATE')]"

Rishi Sunak says he wants to build a stronger economy with his Budget as the nation’s businesses recover from the fallout of Covid-19. It will be the second time this year he has stood in front of MPs and updated them on the state of the nation’s finances, as last year’s budget was delayed until March due to coronavirus. Some 11 areas of investment were announced by the Treasury over the weekend, so there may not be many surprises next week. While he’s made a number of spending pledges, Sunak is also expected to impress on MPs the importance of keeping public finances in a healthy state. Speaking to Times Radio this morning, the Chancellor said that over the past year his main focus was ‘protecting people’s livelihoods, their incomes, their jobs’ amid the pandemic. But he added it was now time to shore up the economy to weather any future storms. He told BBC One’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘That means strong investment in public services, driving economic growth by investing in infrastructure, innovation and skills, giving businesses confidence, and then supporting working families. ‘Those are the ingredients of what makes a stronger Budget and that’s what we will deliver next week.’ But the Chancellor faces a number of challenges, not least a warning from the Bank of England’s new chief economist that inflation could rise above 5%. Sunak told Marr that countries all over the world are facing this issue, due to energy prices and economies opening up rapidly as Covid restrictions are eased. He added: ‘Both of those factors are global factors. We’re not alone in experiencing those problems, I don’t have a magic wand that can make either of those things disappear.’ Public sector workers will also learn if they are getting a payrise, Sunak confirmed this morning, after pay was paused in 2021/22 with the exception of NHS workers on less than £24,000. What do we know about the Budget so far? Transport Tram networks in a number of UK cities are set to be expanded under a £6.9billion investment package (Picture: Getty Images) The Chancellor has already announced a £6.9billion package to ‘level up’ transport links outside of London. Sunak is set to put £5.7billion into station upgrades and sustainable transport settlements for city regions outside the capital to boost productivity. The money will also go towards the expansion of tram networks in a number of cities, as metro mayors are handed the money over a five year period. The Chancellor will also announce £1.2billion of new funding to improve the nation’s bus services, as part of the £3 billion committed by Boris Johnson. Education and children A total of £1.6billion will go towards more lesson time for students taking their T-levels (Picture: Getty Images) Sunak is set to announce a £3billion investment in both post-16 education and training of adults in later life. The Chancellor hopes the package will give people ‘the skills they need to earn more and get on in life’. The number of skills boot camps under the Government’s Plan for Jobs is also set to be quadrupled in areas such as the nuclear industry, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. Some 24,000 traineeships will be created, while £1.6billion will go towards more lesson time for 100,000 students aged 16 to 19 taking their T-levels – technical qualifications introduced in September last year. Existing colleges in England are to be allocated £830million with extra funding for new equipment and facilities. The National Skills Fund will be boosted with a total investment of £550million to quadruple the number of places on the skills boot camps, which are available for adults of any age. Sunak will also announce the expansion of free Level 3 courses for adults, which are equivalent to A-levels, in subjects like maths, chemistry and biology. Critics have said a £500million package to support families with young children still isn’t enough (Picture: Getty Images/iStockphoto) Apprenticeship funding will also increase by £170million to £2.7billion in 2024/25 under the new package. A care package of £500million has also been set aside to boost the development of children in early years education. The Early Years Alliance said critical support is needed for nurseries, childminders and pre-schools, where there have been thousands of recent closures. The care package includes around £80million to create another 75 family hubs across England. They are support centres for families to access services in one place.

Some 300,000 of the most vulnerable in society will be supported with an extra £200million to support people through complex issues that could lead to family breakdown. But Labour said the package barely undoes the damage caused by the Conservatives’ near-decade of austerity, while critics noted a number of services which won’t get funding. Next week’s budget will also include £700million to improve sports and youth clubs and £560million to provide personalised maths coaching. Health Sunak said the pandemic has shown ‘how important innovative research and development is in delivering new, life-saving treatments’ (Picture: PA) The Department of Health and Social Care will be handed £5billion over three years to invest in, among other areas, genomics sequencing and health inequalities. The Chancellor said the pandemic had shown ‘how important innovative research and development is in delivering new, life-saving treatments’. The Office for Life Sciences will receive £95million to deliver on promises over cancer, obesity and mental health. A UK-wide trial of antiviral treatments for Covid-19 will be given £33million, while £40million will be spent on social care reform. The Budget will also include a £30million investment in research and skills training and £20million on research into climate change and health. Sunak is also set to promise £5million for Armed Forces charities to go towards cutting-edge treatments for veterans. Immigration Border Force’s fleet will be retired as 11 new vessels come into service (Picture: Getty Images) Ageing Border Force vessels will be replaced by new cutters as part of a £700million investment to boost security at Britain’s borders, the Treasury have confirmed. The current fleet, which is 20 years old, will be retired and 11 new vessels will come into service to help tackle organised crime and illegal migration at a cost of £74million. Sunak’s budget also includes £628million ‘to modernise and digitalise the border’, with proposals including a US-style Electronic Travel Authorisation for tourists wishing to come to the UK. Electronic authorisations will launch in 2023 and be fully in place two years later and, like the American system, will allow authorities to decide if people should be allowed to travel to the UK prior to their arrival. The Spending Review will also include just over £1billion to be spent over the next three years on ‘new UK sovereign functions’ following Brexit. This will include money for more than 1,000 Border Force officers to deliver customs and transit checks, the Treasury added. Crime The Chancellor’s package aims to crack down on violent offences against women (Picture: Getty Images) A £435million package of measures aimed at preventing crime will form part of next week’s Budget – with a focus on violent offences against women. The Chancellor is expected to pledge millions for better CCTV and improved street lighting and give £80million in additional funding to the Crown Prosecution Service. The Treasury said part of this funding will ‘improve the response to rape and sexual assault cases’. The statement follows widespread shock at the murder of Sarah Everard at the hands of Metropolitan Police officer Wayne Couzens and forces dealing with hundreds of spikings pubs and nightclubs. Funding for victims is also expected to be increased, with the Treasury saying it will be £185million, an increase of 85% from 2019-20 Industry The Treasury will hand out grants to get international firms to invest in the UK’s critical industries (Picture: PA) A £1.4billion Global Britain Investment Fund will hand out grants to encourage internationally mobile companies to invest in the UK’s critical industries, including life sciences and automotive. The Treasury said companies with ‘strategically important investment proposals’ would be able to get grants towards their schemes through the fund. A new talent network will also be set up in innovation hotspots, first in the Bay Area of San Francisco and Boston in the US in 2022, and also Bengaluru in India. Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), said to recover from the pandemic businesses need to get investing. She said: ‘This scheme hits the spot when it comes to some of our most innovative industries in the UK. ‘Businesses will be hopeful that there will be more to come from the Chancellor next week to help get firms investing.’ Arts and culture A number of institutions including the National Railway Museum are to benefit from an £850million package (Picture: Science Museum Group) The Treasury is also set to provide a £850million boost to ‘breathe life’ back into cultural hotspots under a three-year investment. It will be used to upgrade popular galleries and museums, including Tate Liveprool, the V&A and the Imperial War Museum in Duxford. York’s National Railway Museum and the British Library’s Boston Spa site are also expected to benefit from the package. A total of £125million will go towards the building of a new state of the art scientific research centre in Oxfordshire. Part of the Natural History Museum – the centre is set to open in 2026 and will house 27million specimens – over a a third of the museum’s collection. Raphinha takes swipe at referee on Instagram after suffering injury in Leeds draw They will be accessible to researchers around the world digitally, which the Government hopes will strengthen the UK’s position in tackling emerging diseases, climate change and threats to biodiversity. Meanwhile over £75million will go towards improving 110 regional museums and libraries. A total of 67 highstreets are set to benefit from a programme to revive town centres across England by giving old buildings new life as homes, shops, workplaces and community centres. The Chancellor said: ‘From science museums to art galleries to our most cherished historical sites, I am proud to be part of a country with such a strong cultural heritage. ‘That is why we’re investing hundreds of millions – so it’s not just today people can enjoy their favourite spots, but for generations to come.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.

The Department of Health and Social Care will be handed £5billion over three years to invest in, among other areas, genomics sequencing and health inequalities. The Chancellor said the pandemic had shown ‘how important innovative research and development is in delivering new, life-saving treatments’. The Office for Life Sciences will receive £95million to deliver on promises over cancer, obesity and mental health. A UK-wide trial of antiviral treatments for Covid-19 will be given £33million, while £40million will be spent on social care reform. The Budget will also include a £30million investment in research and skills training and £20million on research into climate change and health. Sunak is also set to promise £5million for Armed Forces charities to go towards cutting-edge treatments for veterans. Ageing Border Force vessels will be replaced by new cutters as part of a £700million investment to boost security at Britain’s borders, the Treasury have confirmed. The current fleet, which is 20 years old, will be retired and 11 new vessels will come into service to help tackle organised crime and illegal migration at a cost of £74million. Sunak’s budget also includes £628million ‘to modernise and digitalise the border’, with proposals including a US-style Electronic Travel Authorisation for tourists wishing to come to the UK. Electronic authorisations will launch in 2023 and be fully in place two years later and, like the American system, will allow authorities to decide if people should be allowed to travel to the UK prior to their arrival. The Spending Review will also include just over £1billion to be spent over the next three years on ‘new UK sovereign functions’ following Brexit. This will include money for more than 1,000 Border Force officers to deliver customs and transit checks, the Treasury added. A £435million package of measures aimed at preventing crime will form part of next week’s Budget – with a focus on violent offences against women. The Chancellor is expected to pledge millions for better CCTV and improved street lighting and give £80million in additional funding to the Crown Prosecution Service. The Treasury said part of this funding will ‘improve the response to rape and sexual assault cases’. The statement follows widespread shock at the murder of Sarah Everard at the hands of Metropolitan Police officer Wayne Couzens and forces dealing with hundreds of spikings pubs and nightclubs. Funding for victims is also expected to be increased, with the Treasury saying it will be £185million, an increase of 85% from 2019-20 A £1.4billion Global Britain Investment Fund will hand out grants to encourage internationally mobile companies to invest in the UK’s critical industries, including life sciences and automotive. The Treasury said companies with ‘strategically important investment proposals’ would be able to get grants towards their schemes through the fund. A new talent network will also be set up in innovation hotspots, first in the Bay Area of San Francisco and Boston in the US in 2022, and also Bengaluru in India. Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), said to recover from the pandemic businesses need to get investing. She said: ‘This scheme hits the spot when it comes to some of our most innovative industries in the UK. ‘Businesses will be hopeful that there will be more to come from the Chancellor next week to help get firms investing.’ The Treasury is also set to provide a £850million boost to ‘breathe life’ back into cultural hotspots under a three-year investment. It will be used to upgrade popular galleries and museums, including Tate Liveprool, the V&A and the Imperial War Museum in Duxford. York’s National Railway Museum and the British Library’s Boston Spa site are also expected to benefit from the package. A total of £125million will go towards the building of a new state of the art scientific research centre in Oxfordshire. Part of the Natural History Museum – the centre is set to open in 2026 and will house 27million specimens – over a a third of the museum’s collection. They will be accessible to researchers around the world digitally, which the Government hopes will strengthen the UK’s position in tackling emerging diseases, climate change and threats to biodiversity. Meanwhile over £75million will go towards improving 110 regional museums and libraries. A total of 67 highstreets are set to benefit from a programme to revive town centres across England by giving old buildings new life as homes, shops, workplaces and community centres. The Chancellor said: ‘From science museums to art galleries to our most cherished historical sites, I am proud to be part of a country with such a strong cultural heritage. ‘That is why we’re investing hundreds of millions – so it’s not just today people can enjoy their favourite spots, but for generations to come.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk .

China warns of further spread in latest COVID-19 flare-up,https://www.rappler.com/world/asia-pacific/china-warns-further-coronavirus-spread-october-24-2021,,['Reuters'],,"More than 100 locally transmitted cases have been confirmed over the last week across 11 provincial areas, with most linked to 13 different tour groups","China’s latest COVID-19 outbreak is increasingly likely to spread further, a health official said on Sunday, October 24, as authorities urged all regions to step up monitoring and called for a reduction in travel across provinces. China has largely contained the virus but it is determined to stamp out any sporadic local outbreaks, particularly in the run-up to the 2022 Winter Olympics in February. More than 100 locally transmitted cases have been confirmed over the last week across 11 provincial areas, with most linked to 13 different tour groups. There is increasing risk that the outbreak might spread further, helped by “seasonal factors,” Mi Feng, spokesman at the National Health Commission, told reporters on Sunday. The Delta variant causing the outbreak is also highly transmissible, said commission deputy director Wu Liangyou, adding that sequencing showed it to be different from the source of an earlier outbreak, and suggesting that the new cases came from a new source from abroad. Authorities have banned travel agencies from arranging cross-provincial tours that involve regions deemed of higher virus risk, and has imposed nationwide suspension on some travel services linking multiple tourist attractions. The capital Beijing has said it will impose strict restriction on travels to the city by people who have been to counties with at least one infection. Health authorities also said on Sunday that about 75.6% of China’s population had received complete vaccine doses as of Oct. 23, or some 1.068 billion people. China is giving booster shots to adults whose last dose was at least six months earlier, with priority groups including essential workers, older people and those with weaker immune systems. Data showed antibodies elicited by vaccines, including the most-used shots from Sinovac and Sinopharm, declined within months. Wang Huaqing, chief expert for the immunization program at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said China would not keep giving people booster shots indefinitely. “Even if it needs to be strengthened later, the number of boosters is limited,” Wang told the briefing. “We hope in the future there will be better vaccines and better vaccination procedures to achieve solid protection among the public.” – Rappler.com",2021-10-24 12:25:31,"China's latest COVID-19 outbreak is increasingly likely to spread further, a health official said on Sunday, October 24, as authorities urged all regions to step up monitoring and called for a reduction in travel across provinces.

"Parents more hesitant to vaccinate kids than themselves, researcher says",https://lethbridgenewsnow.com/2021/10/24/parents-more-hesitant-to-vaccinate-kids-than-themselves-researcher-says/,,,,"OTTAWA - Jennifer Hubert jumped at the opportunity to get her COVID-19 vaccine, but she's not looking forward to having to make the decision about whe...","OTTAWA — Jennifer Hubert jumped at the opportunity to get her COVID-19 vaccine, but she’s not looking forward to having to make the decision about whether to vaccinate her three-year-old son Jackson. She recognizes the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, but said she also understands her son is at a much lower risk for serious illness than older adults. “To me it’s not a clear benefit,” she said. While many parents were overjoyed at the news that Health Canada is considering approval of the first COVID-19 vaccine for kids age five to 11 in Canada, parents like Hubert are feeling more trepidatious, and public health officials said they are going to have a much more nuanced conversation with parents about vaccination than they did with adults. While 82 per cent of eligible Canadians aged 12 and up are already fully vaccinated, a recent survey by Angus Reid shows only 51 per cent of parents plan to immediately vaccinate their kids when a pediatric dose becomes available. Of parents with children in the five to 11 year age range, 23 per cent said they would never give their kids a COVID-19 vaccine, 18 per cent said they would wait, and nine per cent said they weren’t sure, according to the survey of 5,011 Canadians between Sept. 29 and Oct. 3, which cannot be assigned a margin of error because online surveys are not considered random samples. “Most of the research that I’ve seen sort of indicates that parents are more hesitant to vaccinate their kids against COVID than themselves,” said Kate Allen, a post-doctoral fellow at the Center for Vaccine Preventable Diseases of the University of Toronto. There are several reasons parents might pause, she said. It’s true that children are at a much lower risk of serious outcomes associated with COVID-19, and there have been very rare incidents of mRNA vaccines like Pfizer or Moderna linked to cases of myocarditis, a swelling of the heart muscle. As of Oct. 1, Health Canada has documented 859 cases associated with the vaccines, which mainly seem to affect people under 40 years old, and people who’ve developed the complication have typically been fine. “I know it’s rare, I know it’s not deadly, but I also see the risk of severe symptoms from COVID as being rare and not deadly for Jackson,” Hubert said when asked about weighing up the risks and benefits of the vaccine. But public health experts stress that some children do suffer from rare but serious impacts from COVID-19, which can also cause myocarditis as well as the little-understood impacts of the condition known as long COVID. They say parents should consider the less tangible benefits of vaccination as well. “It’s less of a conversation about a direct benefit to them, and more of a community benefit,” Allen said. The pandemic has taken a heavy toll on children, depriving them of school, time with their peers, extracurriculars — and their mental health has suffered as a result, said Dr. Vinita Dubey, associate medical officer of health with Toronto Public Health. “Not one child has been spared from this pandemic. I mean every single child has had to bear a sacrifice because of the pandemic in one way or the other,” Dubey said. So far Pfizer-BioNtech is the only manufacturer to request approval for its pediatric COVID-19 vaccine and Health Canada is still reviewing the data. The regulator has promised the review will be thorough, and the vaccine will only be approved for children if the benefits outweigh the potential risks. Policy-makers know they’re going to have to take parents’ concerns seriously as well. On a recent tour of the Childrens’ Hospital of Eastern Ontario in Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with Dr. Anne Pham-Huy, a pediatric infectious diseases physician. “Vaccine confidence is going to be the most important part of it this time around,” Pham-Huy said, to which Trudeau agreed. Dubey has published research on improving parents’ vaccine confidence when it comes to long-established inoculations like mumps and rubella. While she offered several tips, they mainly come down to building trust. Her research focused on the role of family doctors, but she said during the pandemic anyone can be that trusted sounding board. “It could be a faith leader, it could be an important family member or friend, someone who you trust, to help guide you to the right sources to make that decision,” she said. With that in mind, several students from across North America launched a peer-to-peer education program called Students for Herd Immunity to allow kids to have those conversations among themselves. The public health experts agree, the debate around vaccines has become polarized and open conversations will be the key to addressing parents’ concerns. “I think one thing to say to parents is you don’t have to make your decision right away,” Dubey said. “I mean for those who are ready to make their decision, but it’s fine but if you have questions, seek the answers.” Her only advice is to get those answers from a trusted source, and not social media. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Oct. 24, 2021.

She recognizes the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, but said she also understands her son is at a much lower risk for serious illness than older adults. “To me it’s not a clear benefit,” she said. While many parents were overjoyed at the news that Health Canada is considering approval of the first COVID-19 vaccine for kids age five to 11 in Canada, parents like Hubert are feeling more trepidatious, and public health officials said they are going to have a much more nuanced conversation with parents about vaccination than they did with adults. While 82 per cent of eligible Canadians aged 12 and up are already fully vaccinated, a recent survey by Angus Reid shows only 51 per cent of parents plan to immediately vaccinate their kids when a pediatric dose becomes available. Of parents with children in the five to 11 year age range, 23 per cent said they would never give their kids a COVID-19 vaccine, 18 per cent said they would wait, and nine per cent said they weren’t sure, according to the survey of 5,011 Canadians between Sept. 29 and Oct. 3, which cannot be assigned a margin of error because online surveys are not considered random samples. “Most of the research that I’ve seen sort of indicates that parents are more hesitant to vaccinate their kids against COVID than themselves,” said Kate Allen, a post-doctoral fellow at the Center for Vaccine Preventable Diseases of the University of Toronto. There are several reasons parents might pause, she said. It’s true that children are at a much lower risk of serious outcomes associated with COVID-19, and there have been very rare incidents of mRNA vaccines like Pfizer or Moderna linked to cases of myocarditis, a swelling of the heart muscle. As of Oct. 1, Health Canada has documented 859 cases associated with the vaccines, which mainly seem to affect people under 40 years old, and people who’ve developed the complication have typically been fine. “I know it’s rare, I know it’s not deadly, but I also see the risk of severe symptoms from COVID as being rare and not deadly for Jackson,” Hubert said when asked about weighing up the risks and benefits of the vaccine. But public health experts stress that some children do suffer from rare but serious impacts from COVID-19, which can also cause myocarditis as well as the little-understood impacts of the condition known as long COVID. They say parents should consider the less tangible benefits of vaccination as well. “It’s less of a conversation about a direct benefit to them, and more of a community benefit,” Allen said. The pandemic has taken a heavy toll on children, depriving them of school, time with their peers, extracurriculars — and their mental health has suffered as a result, said Dr. Vinita Dubey, associate medical officer of health with Toronto Public Health. “Not one child has been spared from this pandemic. I mean every single child has had to bear a sacrifice because of the pandemic in one way or the other,” Dubey said. So far Pfizer-BioNtech is the only manufacturer to request approval for its pediatric COVID-19 vaccine and Health Canada is still reviewing the data. The regulator has promised the review will be thorough, and the vaccine will only be approved for children if the benefits outweigh the potential risks. Policy-makers know they’re going to have to take parents’ concerns seriously as well. On a recent tour of the Childrens’ Hospital of Eastern Ontario in Ottawa, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with Dr. Anne Pham-Huy, a pediatric infectious diseases physician. “Vaccine confidence is going to be the most important part of it this time around,” Pham-Huy said, to which Trudeau agreed.

Proyecto africano de vacunas trata de reducir la desigualdad,https://www.infobae.com/america/agencias/2021/10/24/proyecto-africano-de-vacunas-trata-de-reducir-la-desigualdad/,,,,,"CIUDAD DEL CABO, Sudáfrica (AP) — En un par de almacenes de Ciudad del Cabo convertidos en un laberinto de salas estériles selladas, jóvenes científicos preparan y calibran el equipamiento necesario para hacer ingeniería inversa sobre una vacuna de coronavirus que aún no ha llegado a Sudáfrica ni a la mayoría de los más pobres del mundo.La energía que se respira en los brillantes laboratorios está a la altura de la urgencia de su misión por reducir la desigualdad de vacunas. En su trabajo para replicar la vacuna de Moderna contra el COVID-19, los científicos básicamente rodean a una industria que ha priorizado de forma clara a los países ricos sobre los pobres, tanto en ventas como en manufactura.Y lo hacen con el inusual apoyo de la Organización Mundial de la Salud, que coordina un centro de investigación, formación y producción de vacunas en Sudáfrica, así como una cadena de suministro asociada para las cruciales materias primas. Es un esfuerzo de último recurso de producir dosis para los que no tienen, y las implicaciones de propiedad intelectual aún no están claras.“Hacemos esto por África en este momento, y eso nos motiva”, dijo Emile Hendricks, un biotecnólogo de 22 años que trabaja para Afrigen Biologics and Vaccines, la empresa que intenta reproducir el fármaco de Moderna. “Ya no podemos depender de que estas grandes superpotencias vengan y nos salven”.Algunos expertos ven la ingeniería inversa -recrear las vacunas a partir de fragmentos de información pública- como una de las pocas formas de combatir los desequilibrios de poder de la pandemia.

La energía que se respira en los brillantes laboratorios está a la altura de la urgencia de su misión por reducir la desigualdad de vacunas. En su trabajo para replicar la vacuna de Moderna contra el COVID-19, los científicos básicamente rodean a una industria que ha priorizado de forma clara a los países ricos sobre los pobres, tanto en ventas como en manufactura. Y lo hacen con el inusual apoyo de la Organización Mundial de la Salud, que coordina un centro de investigación, formación y producción de vacunas en Sudáfrica, así como una cadena de suministro asociada para las cruciales materias primas. Es un esfuerzo de último recurso de producir dosis para los que no tienen, y las implicaciones de propiedad intelectual aún no están claras. “Hacemos esto por África en este momento, y eso nos motiva”, dijo Emile Hendricks, un biotecnólogo de 22 años que trabaja para Afrigen Biologics and Vaccines, la empresa que intenta reproducir el fármaco de Moderna. “Ya no podemos depender de que estas grandes superpotencias vengan y nos salven”. Algunos expertos ven la ingeniería inversa -recrear las vacunas a partir de fragmentos de información pública- como una de las pocas formas de combatir los desequilibrios de poder de la pandemia.

Some 1.068 billion people have now been inoculated with the required dosages, out of a population of 1.412 billion, Mi told a news briefing. The country administered 2.245 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines as of Saturday, official data showed. China is giving booster shots to adults whose last dose was at least six months earlier, with priority groups including essential workers, older people and those with weaker immune systems. Data showed antibodies elicited by vaccines, including the most-used shots from Sinovac and Sinopharm, declined within months. Wang Huaqing, chief expert for the immunization program at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said China would not keep giving people booster shots after booster shots. “We hope that an ideal vaccine works well with the full doses of immunization,” Wang told the briefing. “Even if it needs to be strengthened later, the number of boosters is limited,” Wang said. “We hope in the future there will be better vaccines and better vaccination procedures to achieve solid protection among the public.” China has largely contained the virus in most areas, and the sporadic local outbreaks are tiny compared with those seen in other countries. However, Mi cautioned on Sunday there is increasing risk that China’s latest outbreak, involving over 100 infections in a week across 11 provincial areas, will spread further.

Health Secretary Sajid Javid will tell NHS leaders to allow a third shot five months after a second dose instead of six as he aims to protect people from coronavirus this winter, The Mail on Sunday reported. Earlier this week, he urged eligible people to get a booster jab and the flu vaccine as he warned cases could hit 100,000 a day this winter. But at the moment, those eligible for a booster jab cannot book in advance and must wait an average of 18 days after the six months to get an appointment for a third vaccination. This is one of the reasons only approximately 4.5 million out of the 9.3 million people who qualify for the booster have received one, The Mail on Sunday added. The newspaper said Government sources had promised the new rules would be put in place as soon as possible, allowing eligible people to book a month in advance. Those eligible for boosters include anyone aged 50 and over, people living and working in care homes for the elderly, and frontline health and social care workers. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has urged eligible people to get a booster jab. (AFP) The Prime Minister’s advisors have also considered shortening the six-month window for a booster, but the current time is the optimum period to maximise immunity levels. Boris Johnson and senior health chiefs are also calling on the nation to get vaccinated against COVID-19 amid mounting concern over rising infection levels ahead of Christmas. The PM said vaccines would get the country through the winter and out of the pandemic, while NHS England’s national medical director Professor Stephen Powis said getting a booster will “protect the freedom and Christmas that we have all earned”. The repeated calls for people to get jabbed comes as Mr Johnson resists pleas from health leaders for tighter restrictions despite the rising number of cases. Downing Street insisted there was still spare capacity in the NHS and that Plan B would only be activated if it came under “significant pressure”. Plan B includes working-from-home guidance and the mandatory use of face masks. Boris Johnson has called on the nation to get vaccinated (Reuters) Mr Johnson, who has said there are no plans for another lockdown, said: “Vaccines are our way through this winter. Prof Powis, who said this week that the NHS feels “exceptionally busy”, has written in the Sunday Telegraph that it will “no doubt be a tough winter”. He said this time last year there were more than 6,800 people in hospital with Covid, and this weekend the figure is 6,405, but in 2020 the nation was still six weeks away from the world’s first vaccination. Mr Javid is also said to be ready to enforce laws to make Covid vaccines mandatory for people working for the NHS.  The calls for people to get their boosters come after Professor Peter Openshaw, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said case numbers and death rates are currently “unacceptable”.

"Lachine Rapids where Montreal firefighter died have a long, dangerous history",https://lethbridgenewsnow.com/2021/10/24/lachine-rapids-where-montreal-firefighter-died-have-a-long-dangerous-history/,,,,MONTREAL - The stretch of the St. Lawrence River where a Montreal firefighter died during a rescue last week has been known for centuries as one of th...,"MONTREAL — The stretch of the St. Lawrence River where a Montreal firefighter died during a rescue last week has been known for centuries as one of the city’s most treacherous. Today, the Lachine Rapids are mostly an attraction for surfers, sport kayakers and riverside picnickers, but the death of 58-year-old Pierre Lacroix is a reminder that Montreal owes its very existence to their dangerous nature. Lacroix was one of four firefighters who were on a boat that capsized last Sunday night while trying to help a couple in another boat in distress. While the others were all rescued, Lacroix died after becoming trapped under the boat. Louise Desrosiers, a spokeswoman for the Montreal fire department, said rescue boats typically avoid venturing into the fast-moving current of the rapids. “It’s a sector that’s dangerous, so boats will go upstream to save people or downstream to recuperate people who have passed through the rapids,” she said in a phone interview. Desrosiers says eight fire stations have nautical rescue units, all staffed by specially trained employees. Calls for help are initially categorized as either “engine trouble” or the more serious “maritime emergency,” which usually happens when someone is in the water or in immediate danger. While the boaters in the incident involving Lacroix had first reported an engine stall, Desrosiers said she couldn’t confirm how the call had been categorized. An investigation into his death remains ongoing. Michel Martin, a prevention officer with the Canadian Coast Guard Auxiliary, describes the rapids as “unforgiving” and “a trap.” Since he began with the service in 2014, he said he’s seen more and more boaters, paddle boarders and fishermen out on the water – some of them inexperienced or unaware when they first start getting caught in the current. He said the auxiliary coast boats, like the fire rescue, don’t venture into the rapids because the boats aren’t designed for the conditions he describes as rocky and unpredictable, with fast-moving water that varies from a third of a metre to three metres deep. “We’ll do everything to help people in distress, but not at the expense of the life of our members,” he said in a phone interview. Lacroix is far from the first person to lose his life in the dangerous waters of the rapids. For better or worse, the rushing waters have shaped the city’s existence from its earliest days, according to historian Denis Gravel. “Montreal wouldn’t be Montreal without the rapids,” said Gravel, who specializes in municipal history. While the island was long used as a meeting and fishing place for Indigenous people, it served as a roadblock for European explorers including Jacques Cartier and Samuel de Champlain, who stopped after learning their ships could not proceed further upriver. Until the Lachine Canal opened in 1825 to bypass the rapids, goods heading toward the Great Lakes had to be unloaded in the Montreal area or portaged — leading to the city developing as an area of trade and settlement. “From the beginning of European settlement, there are “many, many stories of shipwrecks and danger, of people who drowned or went fishing and didn’t pay attention,” Gravel said. One of the earliest reported incidents involved an associate of Champlain’s who headed to a nearby island along with two Indigenous men. Their boat, laden with birds, capsized on the way back, and two of the three drowned. While the rapids were nearly impassable heading west, boats would still try to run the rapids the other way. Some were rafts laden with goods and steered by specialist pilots who, despite their skill, sometimes lost their cargo to the current. Later, steamboats carried tourists looking for a thrill. In 1873 one such boat, the Louis Renaud, crashed in the rapids, reportedly avoiding tragedy thanks to the Mohawks from nearby Kahnawake who came to the passengers’ aid. There have been other incidents in more recent years. A fisherman died after losing his footing in 2010, and a surfer died after falling at a popular surfing locale dubbed the standing wave in 2013. This summer, a man disappeared after falling off a boat. The number of rescues in Montreal’s waters appears to be rising, although mishaps at the rapids have remained stable. The Montreal fire department has seen a 30 per cent increase in the overall number of nautical incidents since 2019 — something Desrosiers says could be attributable to the rising popularity of outdoor sports during the COVID-19 pandemic. Desrosiers says it’s important for boaters, especially less experienced ones, to remember the St. Lawrence’s strong currents make it challenging to navigate. She said it’s also crucial for boaters to familiarize themselves with their vessels and the places where they’re boating, to avoid drugs and alcohol and to wear a properly-fitted life-jacket.

As millions of soldiers return home from the First World War, a new disease begins to sweep through Britain. It was the deadly 'Spanish Flu' that infected a third of the global population, causing deaths of millions of people. In view of the widespread prevalence of that disease, the then Local Government had to issue Health Advisory public notice to suck Formamint tablet and a small dose of Quinine to protect them from the danger of infection.

Such wilderness is not intended for human habitation as our forward locations are based in a remote corner that is miles away from the nearest settlement. We need to protect ourselves by taking all possible precautions from any infectious disease. As even symptoms like aching of limbs and headache are too not readily recognizable for unavailability of competent medicos, which may lead to serious complications. There is no reason why soldiers shouldn't adopt the preventive measures thereby Medical Officers of Armed Force Doctors enforce on a routine affair. I was literally blown away by the dos and don'ts that convinced me fully. The story goes on and wine flies for the soldier-duo with a few small drinks until dinner was ready at sharp nine on that arriving-day evening. Those days of combat readiness are still fresh in my memory despite the fact soldiers faced a daunting task while facing enemy over infective virus in the battlefield. However, another pandemic of COVID-19 has devastated India in the second wave. Three-and-a-half crore people had the victims of that severe acute respiratory syndrome. The reality of that situation has not been realized until recently when this writer got infected that reminded him after a series of health hazards with his entire family. A physical war would have been better as one can see enemy in front but he faced such helplessness while fighting with an invisible enemy. Hospital experiences of COVID wards are not as positive as people mostly remain at home quarantine to nurse themselves for health attention and even people hide from COVID test but go for self-medication. The symptoms are endless from high fever to cough, tiredness, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, headaches, aches and pain, diarrhea vomiting, irritated eyes, rash on skin and what more…the series of illness attack together to body. Neighbours felt scary the way frightened of getting infected from sufferer. Soon the message spread, the door was shut and felt alienated from own surrounding. Victims experienced alien isolation, as if felt like a survivor while outsiders faced away from ailing people. Interestingly the healing experience was a few PCM, Antibiotic and Vitamins besides there are Syrups, drugs of various symptoms of difficulties and large quantities of warm water with Oral Rehydration Salts. He feared hostile from neighbours of being coronavirus carriers. Even the reports of SARS-COV-2 RNA are negative, they are marked asymptomatic. The rise of fear and misinformation about COVID fuels xenophobia between haves and haves not. Can victims continue to pull on self-isolation for a long period? As the festival is on, devotees visit mandaps to seek the blessings of idols. Priests and choir chanted the story of the resurrection through the waves of loudspeakers. Victims felt blessings from the rhythm of the dhak of Arti at distance. Words couldn't express his gratitude towards compassionate attention, plenty of advice and professional care from doctors, friends and well-wishers.

Those days of combat readiness are still fresh in my memory despite the fact soldiers faced a daunting task while facing enemy over infective virus in the battlefield. However, another pandemic of COVID-19 has devastated India in the second wave. Three-and-a-half crore people had the victims of that severe acute respiratory syndrome. The reality of that situation has not been realized until recently when this writer got infected that reminded him after a series of health hazards with his entire family. A physical war would have been better as one can see enemy in front but he faced such helplessness while fighting with an invisible enemy. Hospital experiences of COVID wards are not as positive as people mostly remain at home quarantine to nurse themselves for health attention and even people hide from COVID test but go for self-medication. The symptoms are endless from high fever to cough, tiredness, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, headaches, aches and pain, diarrhea vomiting, irritated eyes, rash on skin and what more…the series of illness attack together to body.

Victims experienced alien isolation, as if felt like a survivor while outsiders faced away from ailing people. Interestingly the healing experience was a few PCM, Antibiotic and Vitamins besides there are Syrups, drugs of various symptoms of difficulties and large quantities of warm water with Oral Rehydration Salts. He feared hostile from neighbours of being coronavirus carriers. Even the reports of SARS-COV-2 RNA are negative, they are marked asymptomatic.

As the festival is on, devotees visit mandaps to seek the blessings of idols. Priests and choir chanted the story of the resurrection through the waves of loudspeakers. Victims felt blessings from the rhythm of the dhak of Arti at distance. Words couldn't express his gratitude towards compassionate attention, plenty of advice and professional care from doctors, friends and well-wishers. Though medication treats fever and pain in a couple of weeks but only the time can heal the pain of their grief.",https://assets.sentinelassam.com/h-upload/2021/10/24/500x300_262903-kamalbaruah.jpg,sentinel,True,"[('the Indo-Pak', 'FAC'), ('one', 'CARDINAL'), ('the very first day', 'DATE'), ('Field Supper Bar', 'FAC'), ('the early 20th century', 'DATE'), ('millions', 'CARDINAL'), ('the First World War', 'EVENT'), ('Britain', 'GPE'), (""Spanish Flu'"", 'WORK_OF_ART'), ('a third', 'CARDINAL'), ('millions', 'CARDINAL'), ('Local Government', 'ORG'), ('Health Advisory', 'ORG'), ('Formamint', 'PERSON'), ('Quinine', 'ORG'), ('two', 'CARDINAL'), ('PCM', 'ORG'), ('medicos', 'PRODUCT'), ('Armed Force Doctors', 'ORG'), ('nine', 'CARDINAL'), ('Those days', 'DATE'), ('COVID-19', 'ORG'), ('India', 'GPE'), ('second', 'ORDINAL'), ('Three', 'CARDINAL'), ('COVID', 'PERSON'), ('COVID', 'PERSON'), ('PCM, Antibiotic', 'ORG'), ('Vitamins', 'PERSON'), ('Syrups', 'ORG'), ('COVID', 'PERSON'), ('a couple of weeks', 'DATE')]"
